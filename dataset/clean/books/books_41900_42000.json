        "Description": "As National Public Radio's senior foreign correspondent, Anne Garrels has covered conflicts in Chechnya, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. She is renowned for direct, down-to-earth, insightful reportage, and for her independent take on what she sees. One of only sixteen un-embedded American journalists who stayed in Baghdad's now-legendary Palestine Hotel throughout the American invasion of Iraq, she was at the very center of the storm. Naked in Baghdad gives us the sights, sounds, and smells of our latest war with unparalleled vividness and immediacy.Garrels's narrative starts with several trips she made to Baghdad before the war, beginning in October 2002. At its heart is her evolving relationship with her Iraqi driver/minder, Amer, who becomes her friend and confidant, often serving as her eyes and ears among the populace and taking her where no other reporter was able to penetrate. Amer's own strong reactions and personal dilemma provide a trenchant counterpoint to daily events. The story is also punctuated by e-mail bulletins sent by Garrels's husband, Vint Lawrence, to their friends around the world, giving a private view of the rough-and-tumble, often dangerous life of a foreign correspondent, along with some much-needed comic relief.The result is enthralling, deeply personal, utterly authentic--an on-the-ground picture of the war in Iraq that no one else could have written. As Chicago Sun-Times critic Lloyd Sachs wrote about Garrels's work in Baghdad, \"a few choice words, honestly delivered, are worth more than a thousand pictures . . . In your mind's eye, they carry lasting truth.\"",

        "Description": "The bestselling author of Body of Secrets and The Puzzle Palace presents his most hard-hitting book to date\u2014a sweeping, authoritative, and fearless account of the failures of America\u2019s intelligence agencies and the Bush administration\u2019s calculated efforts to sell a war to the American people.In The Puzzle Palace, James Bamford revealed the existence of the NSA, the largest, most secretive, and best-financed intelligence organization in the world. In Body of Secrets, he took readers inside the ultrasecret agency, charting its deeds and misdeeds from its founding in 1952 to the end of the twentieth century. Now Bamford applies his relentless investigative drive and unparalleled access to intelligence sources to produce a headline-making book about the most pressing issues of the present day.From the mishandling of the pre-9/11 threat to the unproven claims about Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction, Bamford argues that the Bush administration has co-opted the intelligence community for its own political ends, and at the expense of American security.\u00a0 Bamford makes the case that the Bush administration\u2019s Middle East policy decisions, from overthrowing Saddam to ignoring the situation of the Palestinians, are driven by long-held beliefs and goals of an elite group of conservatives inside and outside of government.A Pretext for War homes in on the systematic weakness that led the intelligence community to ignore or misinterpret evidence of the impending terrorist attacks of 9/11\u2014a failure rooted in the refusal to acknowledge the central role of the Palestinian cause in igniting Arab rage against the United States.\u00a0 Compounding the errors, the Bush administration\u2019s immediate response to 9/11 was to call for an attack on Iraq, and it subsequently invented justifications for the preemptive war that has ultimately left the United States more vulnerable to terrorism.\u00a0\u00a0 A Pretext for War is an unprecedented, utterly convincing expos\u00e9 of the most secretive administration in history.",

        "Description": "James Levine, the legendary conductor and artistic director of the Metropolitan Opera, is one of the most public and yet most private figures in classical music. In his more than twenty-five years as maestro of the Met, Levine has carried his musical message around the world. His appearances in the opera houses and concert halls of Europe and Japan have been greeted with a fervor that not only matches but sometimes exceeds the loyalty and adoration of his fans in America.  In Dialogues and Discoveries, eminent music critic Robert C. Marsh presents the man behind the musical triumphs. From a series of interviews and conversations conducted over a period of twenty-five years with the maestro, his family, his colleagues, and his friends, Marsh brings us the private, the personal James Levine.  Levine's musical gifts were recognized early and fostered by his loving and understanding family in Ohio. Both parents had had professional careers -- his father was a musician, his mother an actress -- and they indulged and encouraged their prodigiously talented son, whether he was memorizing opera scores during elementary school recesses or designing productions with a toy theater.  By the time he was in his teens, Levine was working with the remarkable George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, where he made his debut at the age of twenty-three. Four years later, he was at the Metropolitan Opera and also served as the director of the Ravinia Festival, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony, for twenty-three seasons. Today he is truly, as New York magazine has said, \"the Met's most valuable player.\" Under his guidance, the opera house has become the premier operatic stage in the world and the Metropolitan Orchestra one of the finest ensembles.  In Europe, he has been a regular conductor at the Wagnerian shrine, Bayreuth; the Salzburg Festival; and in Vienna and Berlin. In addition, he appears regularly on television and will conduct Fantasia 2000, the long-awaited sequel to the Disney classic Fantasia.  Robert Marsh has covered Levine in the concert hall, the recording studio, the opera house, and arenas and stadiums for the blockbuster Three Tenors concerts. He has produced a fascinating look at the world of classical music. Levine has known and worked with the famous musical figures of the past twenty-five years, and they all appear in Dialogues and Discoveries -- sopranos and basses, violinists and pianists, tenors and baritones.  One voice is dominant throughout, however -- that of James Levine. Here are Levine's opinions of famous colleagues, conductors, opera houses, and orchestras, as well as his assessments of the state of musical performance and the future of the performing arts. Dialogues and Discoveries is both a biography and an autobiography of one of the great musical artists of the twentieth century.",

The officer was reported to have died in a car crash at the war\u2019s end, and the whereabouts of the Trabuc between then and now remain a mystery. Ryder\u2019s search for the widow\u2019s heirs leads him to Rachel Meredith, who teaches at NYU. The museum presents the painting to her in a spectacular public ceremony that winds up on the front page of newspapers around the world.Though the case is closed, Ryder can\u2019t seem to shake it. When Rachel Meredith is attacked, she calls on him; what might be a simple assault doesn\u2019t quite add up. And he still wonders who sent the van Gogh from Argentina. One of his most reliable contacts in the art world floats a theory that ties the van Gogh portrait to a black market auction in the 70\u2019s that might have involved a Swiss art dealer and an international crime kingpin with unlimited cash. Then Israel\u2019s Mossad pays Ryder a clandestine visit; the news splash about the van Gogh is the first link they\u2019ve had to the SS officer in decades.Meanwhile, art dealers, auction houses, and museums vie to buy the van Gogh from Rachel Meredith. When she refuses to sell, the situation goes from predatory to violent. Ryder has to race against time to outmaneuver a cunning mastermind who will resort to as many murders as it takes to get hold of the Trabuc.",

        "Authors": "By Warren, Kay",
        "Description": "You have a plan for the rest of your life. God has a plan for the rest of your life. Are they the same?You have expectations for how your life will play out, and you hope those plans will become realities.But what if God's plan for your life is far different from what you had in mind? Can you accept that? Will you surrender your goals for God's? Kay Warren had a plan. Together with her husband, Rick Warren, author of the megaseller The Purpose Driven Life, she planned that after her kids were grown, she'd travel the world, teaching and encouraging couples in ministry. It was a good plan. But it wasn't what God had in mind for her.In a startling wake-up call, Kay discovered the shocking realities of the AIDS pandemic in Africa while reading a magazine. 'I want to use you!' she heard God say. That began the struggle---first to avoid God's call and then to surrender herself to God.She cried out to God, 'Why are you bothering me with this? There's nothing I can do about it. I'm just an ordinary person. What could one person do about such a gigantic problem' But God had grabbed her attention and wouldn't let go.If you've ever struggled with knowing and doing God's will, this book is for you. With raw honesty, Kay goes straight to the heart of the matter: the bottom line is surrender. Will you trust God? Along the way she'll introduce you to others---people like you---who have said yes to God and have made a difference in the world. Using their skills, energy, faith, and a willingness to take risks, they became powerful instruments of change and tools in God's hands.Giving in to God isn't easy. It's not for cowards. It's the boldest, riskiest step you'll ever take. This dangerous surrender can bring both joy and pain, both heartache and ecstasy, but it enables you to know God in a far deeper way than ever before. I had to make a conscious decision. Would I retreat to my comfortable life and to my settled plans? Or would I surrender to God's call and let my heart engage with a cause such as AIDS that I was pretty sure would include buckets of pain and sorrow? I felt like I was standing on the edge of a giant precipice; I couldn't go back, and yet the way forward looked like stepping into a void. Kay Warren took that step, choosing to dangerously surrender to God. That decision transformed her life, marriage, and future. She invites you to do the same.You'll benefit most by discussing this book with others. A Readers' Group Discussion Guide is provided in the back of the book.

Together with Humphrey Bogart she produced some of the most electric scenes in movie history, and their romance on and off screen made them Hollywood's most celebrated couple.But when Bogart died of cancer in 1957, Bacall and their children had to take everything he had taught them and grow up fast. In a time of postwar communism, Hollywood blacklisting, and revolutionary politics, she mixed with the legends: Hemingway, the Oliviers, Katharine Hepburn, Bobby Kennedy, and Gregory Peck. She was engaged to Frank Sinatra and had a turbulent second marriage to Jason Robards. But Bacall never lost sight of the strength that made her a superstar, and she never lost sight of Bogie.Now, on the silver anniversary of its original publication, Bacall brings her inspiring memoir up to date, chronicling the events of the past twenty-five years, including her recent films and Broadway runs, and her fond memories of many close lifelong friendships. As one of the greatest actresses of all time turns eighty, By Myself and Then Some reveals the legend in her own beautiful frank words -- encapsulating a story that even Hollywood would struggle to reproduce.",

Lifetime dogs are dogs we love in especially powerful, sometimes inexplicable ways.\u201d\u2013Jon KatzIn this gripping and deeply touching book, bestselling author Jon Katz tells the story of his lifetime dog, Orson: a beautiful border collie\u2013intense, smart, crazy, and unforgettable.From the moment Katz and Orson meet, when the dog springs from his traveling crate at Newark airport and panics the baggage claim area, their relationship is deep, stormy, and loving. At two years old, Katz\u2019s new companion is a great herder of school buses, a scholar of refrigerators, but a dud at herding sheep. Everything Katz attempts\u2013 obedience training, herding instruction, a new name, acupuncture, herb and alternative therapies\u2013helps a little but not enough, and not for long. \u201cLike all border collies and many dogs,\u201d Katz writes, \u201che needed work. I didn\u2019t realize for some time I was the work Orson would find.\u201dWhile Katz is trying to help his dog, Orson is helping him, shepherding him toward a new life on a two-hundred-year-old hillside farm in upstate New York. There, aided by good neighbors and a tolerant wife, hip-deep in sheep, chickens, donkeys, and more dogs, the man and his canine companion explore meadows, woods, and even stars, wade through snow, bask by a roaring wood stove, and struggle to keep faith with each other. There, with deep love, each embraces his unfolding destiny. A Good Dog is a book to savor. Just as Orson was the author\u2019s lifetime dog, his story is a lifetime treasure\u2013poignant, timeless, and powerful.",
