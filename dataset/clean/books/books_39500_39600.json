        "Title": "Writing Through Childhood: Rethinking Process and Product",
        "Authors": "By Harwayne, Shelley",
        "Description": "Shelley Harwayne has been rethinking the teaching of writing ever since she opened the Manhattan New School ten years ago. There, as principal, she had the unique opportunity to follow her students' growth as writers from the very first day they entered kindergarten through graduation six years later. Now, as superintendent of her New York City school district, Shelley continues to take a hard look at the teaching of writing across schools and throughout the grades, questioning what has become traditional practice.  In Writing Through Childhood, Shelley dares us to rethink our beliefs about how we design writing workshops, use writer's notebooks, choose appropriate genres, teach spelling, help students connect their reading to their writing, and even edit and publish students' writing. Filled with stories and work samples of real children in a diverse urban setting, the book will inspire rich conversations in which educators ask essential questions about their own practice, including:  Does my writing workshop support the notion that writing during childhood is different than writing as an adult? How can I tap into the interests and attitudes young students bring to the writing workshop? How can I approach revision with children's sensitivities and strengths in mind? Are the genres I've been assigning really appropriate for young writers? How can I help young writers make deliberate and long-lasting connections to the literature they read? How can I simplify publishing so that children joyfully and frequently publish high-quality work?  In this volume, the third in a trilogy that includes Going Public and Lifetime Guarantees, Shelley provides a close-up look at the subject that has meant the most to her. Her special insight and discoveries will challenge all educators who are involved in elementary writing.",

        "Title": "Too Late to Say Goodbye: A True Story of Murder and Betrayal",
        "Authors": "By Rule, Ann",
        "Description": "Jenn Corbin, a lovely, slim, brown-eyed blonde, appeared to have it all: two dear little boys, a posh home in one of the upscale suburbs of Atlanta, expensive cars, a plush houseboat, and a husband -- Dr. Bart Corbin, a successful dentist -- who was tall, handsome, and brilliant.But gradually their seemingly idyllic life together began to crumble. There was talk of seeing a marriage counselor. Bart was distraught; Jenn seemed disenchanted. She needed to reach out to someone she could confide in -- beyond her mother and her sisters. Then, just a few weeks before Christmas 2004, Jenn was found dead with a bullet in her head, a revolver beside her. From the position of the body her death appeared to be a suicide. But Gwinnett County detective Marcus Head was not totally convinced, nor was Jenn's family, who could not believe she would take her own life.And how was this death related to another apparent suicide fourteen years earlier -- that of Dorothy \"Dolly\" Hearn, a spectacularly beautiful dental student? A star athlete and homecoming queen in high school, Dolly later dated Bart Corbin in dental school. Was there a connection, or was the answer to be found in a secret -- even dangerous -- relationship Jenn Corbin was having outside her marriage? For Too Late to Say Goodbye, Ann Rule has interviewed virtually everyone in any way related to the story -- the victims' families, police investigators, prosecutors, and sources from Georgia to Australia -- to uncover the truth behind the headlines of these two sensational deaths. What emerges is an incredible tale of jealous rage; of stunning circumstantial and physical evidence that runs from the steamy to the macabre to almost-unheard-of forensic techniques; and of a tragic irony -- a fateful discovery that motivated the killing. The definitive unraveling of one of the strangest murder investigations of our time, Too Late to Say Goodbye is perhaps the finest achievement of a truly great writer's career.",

        "Description": "Ten years ago, Sarah Susanka started a revolution in home design with a deceptively simple message: quality should always come before quantity. Now, the book that celebrated that bold declaration is back in this special 10th anniversary edition featuring a new introduction and 16 additional pages that explore three new homes.Nearly a quarter-million people bought this ground-breaking book when it was published in Fall 1998. Since then, the book's simple message \u2014 that quality should come before quantity \u2014 has started a movement in home design. Homeowners now know to expect more. And the people responsible for building our homes have also gotten the message. Architects and builders around the country report clients showing up with dog-eared copies of The Not So Big House, pages marked to a favorite section.Why are we drawn more to smaller, more personal spaces than to larger, more expansive ones? Why do we spend more time in the kitchen than we do in the formal dining room? The Not So Big House proposes clear, workable guidelines for creating homes that serve both our spiritual needs and our material requirements, whether for a couple with no children, a family, empty nesters, or one person alone.In 1999, Sarah Susanka was then architect and principal with Mulfinger, Susanka, Mahady & Partners, the firm selected to design the 1999 Life Dream House brought Frank Lloyd Wright's same common-sense, human-scale design principles to our generation. Consider which rooms in your house you use and enjoy most, and you have a sense of the essential principles of The Not So Big House. Whether you seek comfort and calm or activity and energy at home, The Not So Big House offers a place for every mood.",

        "Description": "Switched at birth by a young slave woman attempting to protect her son from the horrors of slavery, a light-skinned infant changes places with the master's white son. This simple premise is the basis of Pudd'nhead Wilson, a compelling drama that contains all the elements of a classic 19th-century mystery: reversed identities, a ghastly crime, an eccentric detective, and a tense courtroom scene.First published in 1894, Twain's novel bristles with suspense. David \"Pudd\u2019nhead\" Wilson, a wise but unorthodox lawyer who collects fingerprints as a hobby, wins back the respect of his townspeople when he solves a local murder in which two foreigners are falsely accused. Witty and absorbing, this novel features a literary first \u2014 the use of fingerprinting to solve a crime. This gem was Twain's last novel about the antebellum South; and despite its frequent injections of humor, it offers a fierce condemnation of racial prejudice and a society that condoned slavery.",

Caputo landed at Da Nang with the first ground combat unit deployed to Vietnam. Sixteen months later, having served on the line in one of modern history's ugliest wars, he returned home\u2014physically whole but emotionally wasted, his youthful idealism forever gone. A Rumor of War is more than one soldier's story. Upon its publication in 1977, it shattered America's indifference to the fate of the men sent to fight in the jungles of Vietnam. In the years since then, it has become not only a basic text on the Vietnam War but also a renowned classic in the literature of wars throughout history and, as Caputo explains, of \"the things men do in war and the things war does to men.\" \"A singular and marvelous work.\" \u2014The New York Times",

Kennedy.Written in 1955 by the then junior senator from the state of Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy's\u00a0Profiles in Courage\u00a0serves as a clarion call to every American. In this book Kennedy chose eight of his historical colleagues to profile for their acts of astounding integrity in the face of overwhelming opposition. These heroes, coming from different junctures in our nation\u2019s history, include John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Thomas Hart Benton, and Robert A. Taft.Now, a half-century later, the book remains a moving, powerful, and relevant testament to the indomitable national spirit and an unparalleled celebration of that most noble of human virtues. It resounds with timeless lessons on the most cherished of virtues and is a powerful reminder of the strength of the human spirit. Profiles in Courage is as Robert Kennedy states in the foreword: \u201cnot just stories of the past but a book of hope and confidence for the future. What happens to the country, to the world, depends on what we do with what others have left us.\"Along with vintage photographs and an extensive author biography, this book features Kennedy's correspondence about the writing project, contemporary reviews, a letter from Ernest Hemingway, and two rousing speeches from recipients of the Profile in Courage Award.\u00a0 Introduction by John F. Kennedy\u2019s daughter Caroline Kennedy, forward by John F. Kennedy\u2019s brother Robert F. Kennedy.",

        "Description": "Accelerating social, economic, and environmental pressures are now undermining the security of societies around the world, according to security expert Michael Renner. Since the end of the Cold War, a volatile mix of environmental degradation, inequitable distribution of land and wealth, ethnic antagonisms, and rapid population growth is producing social and political strife, and even causing the wholesale disintegration of countries.The author argues that true security has less to do with how many tanks or soldiers a country can marshal and more with how well it protects its arable lands and watersheds and how well it manages to meet peoples social and economic needs. Military means are often irrelevant or even counterproductive in this new security equation; they are a depreciating asset. At a time when the United Nations has been devoting a sharply higher share of its resources to peacekeeping, while reducing spending on basic environmental and economic development, this new book provides a wake-up call for policy makers around the world.",

It will thrill readers who cherish their worn copies of To Kill A Mockingbird.\" --PeopleWith a suspense, lyricism, and moral complexity that recall To Kill a Mockingbird and Presumed Innocent, this compulsively readable novel explores what happens when a woman who has devoted herself to ushering life into the world finds herself charged with responsibility in a patient's tragic death.The time is 1981, and Sibyl Danforth has been a dedicated midwife in the rural community of Reddington, Vermont, for fifteen years. But one treacherous winter night, in a house isolated by icy roads and failed telephone lines, Sibyl takes desperate measures to save a baby's life. She performs an emergency Caesarean section on its mother, who appears to have died in labor. But what if--as Sibyl's assistant later charges--the patient wasn't already dead, and it was Sibyl who inadvertently killed her?As recounted by Sibyl's precocious fourteen-year-old daughter, Connie, the ensuing trial bears the earmarks of a witch hunt except for the fact that all its participants are acting from the highest motives--and the defendant increasingly appears to be guilty. As Sibyl Danforth faces the antagonism of the law, the hostility of traditional doctors, and the accusations of her own conscience, Midwives engages, moves, and transfixes us as only the very best novels ever do.",

        "Description": "Reduce the threat of network attacks with an authorized self-study guideOne of the primary components of any organization's security policy is the implementation and maintenance of firewalls. Firewalls are network devices residing at the perimeter of corporate networks that protect internal networks from intrusion by the outside world. The integrated hardware/software PIX Firewall series delivers high security without impacting network performance while scaling to meet the entire range of customer requirements. Based on the official instructor-led training course (Cisco Secure PIX Firewall Advanced-CSPFA), Cisco Secure PIX Firewalls teaches you the skills needed to describe, configure, verify, and manage the PIX Firewall product family and the Cisco IOS(r) Firewall feature set. Starting with a discussion of hacking methodologies and internal and external threats, this book opens by describing the Cisco Security Wheel, emphasizing network security as a continuous process. The authors then familiarize you with the characteristics of the various PIX models and examine upgrade tasks. This book covers basic installation details, as well as how to enable more advanced features and access control. In addition, this book details management and monitoring with PIX Syslog services and the PIX AAA subsystem. You also learn to configure the PIX Failover mechanism, IPSec on the PIX, and the Cisco IOS Firewall feature set. The appendixes provide helpful references, including configuring PIX intrusion detection features, SNMP management support, DHCP client and server, Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) connection, and dozens of security-related resources. Whether you are preparing for the Cisco Security Specialist 1 certification or simply want to understand and make the most efficient use of PIX Firewalls, Cisco Secure PIX Firewalls provides you with a complete solution for planning, deploying, and managing PIX Firewall protected networks.Prepare for the Cisco Security Specialist 1 PIX exam with the official CSPFA self-study guideUnderstand the physical characteristics of PIX models 506, 515, 520, 525, and 535, including LED information and port and slot numberingUpgrade PIX OS code, perform password recovery, and install feature licensesConfigure IPSec Phase I and Phase II Security AssociationsConfigure Cisco routers to perform Context Based Access Control (CBAC)Examine the many operating features of the PIX, such as Cut-Through Proxy, Advanced Protocol Handling, Attack Guards, and the Adaptive Security Algorithm (ASA)Learn the ins and outs of address translation and access control Install the Cisco Secure ACS server and configure corresponding services on the PIX to authenticate and authorize users and servicesUnderstand attack guards such as Syn Flood, Fragmentation, AAA, DNS, and Mail Examine the workings of the PIX failover mechanism and learn the difference between failover, stateful failover, interface testing, and the failover pollDavid W.

Yet I hope that there is room for the remembrance of a friend who knew him-not wisely, perhaps, but fairly well-on an island that was \"not his kind of place,\" but where he came season after season, year after year; and where he, too, will be subsumed into the capacious story.For millennia the cliffs of Capri have sheltered pleasure-seekers and refugees alike, among them the emperors Augustus and Tiberius, Henry James, Rilke, and Lenin, and hosts of artists, eccentrics, and outcasts. Here in the 1960s Graham Greene became friends with Shirley Hazzard and her husband, the writer Francis Steegmuller; their friendship lasted until Greene's death in 1991. In Greene on Capri, Hazzard uses their ever volatile intimacy as a prism through which to illuminate Greene's mercurial character, his work and talk, and the extraordinary literary culture that long thrived on this ravishing, enchanted island.",
