AGEs are at least as detrimental to our health as transfats but have been largely unknown outside the medical community. AGEs give us wrinkles, but they have also been implicated in serious age-related conditions that cut across all medical specialties, from Alzheimer\u2019s and cataracts to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Yet we have not had strategic interventions for stopping and reversing the effects of AGEs until now. Dr. Perricone shows us how to win the fight against AGEs with a three-part plan of attack that includes a nutritional program, targeted supplements, and new topicals. His groundbreaking program helps to \u2022 erase wrinkles and firm sagging skin \u2022 reverse age-related memory loss\u2022 heal cardiovascular disease\u2022 stop precursors of cancer\u2022 prevent symptoms of diabetesAgeless Face, Ageless Mind brings us not only a new and exciting field of research and its remarkable discoveries, but also a way to fight one of the biggest hidden threats to our immediate and long-term health.",

        "Title": "A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton",
        "Authors": "By Bernstein, Carl",
        "Description": "Carl Bernstein\u2019s stunning portrait of Hillary Rodham Clinton shows us, as nothing else has, the true trajectory of her life and career with its zigzag bursts of risks taken and safety sought. Marshaling all the skills and energy that propelled his history-making Pulitzer Prize reporting on Watergate, Bernstein gives us the most detailed, sophisticated, comprehensive, and revealing account we have had of the complex human being and political meteor who has already helped define one presidency and may well become, herself, the woman in charge of another.We see the shaping of Hillary as a self-described \u201cmind conservative and heart liberal\u201d \u2014her ostensibly idyllic Midwestern girlhood (her mother a nurturer, but her father a disciplinarian, harsher than she has acknowledged); her early development of deep religious feelings; her curiosity fueled by dedicated teachers, by exposure to Martin Luther King Jr., by the ferment of the sixties, and, above all, by a desire to change the world. At Wellesley, we watch Hillary, a Republican turned Democrat, thriving in the new sky\u2019s-the-limit freedom for women, already perceived as a spokeswoman for her generation, her commencement speech celebrated in Life magazine. And the book takes us to Yale Law School as Hillary meets and falls in love with Bill Clinton and cancels her dream to go her own way, to New York or Washington, tying her fortune, instead, to his in Arkansas.Bernstein clarifies the often amazing dynamic of their marriage, shows us the extent to which Hillary has been instrumental in the triumphs and troubles of Bill Clinton\u2019s governorship and presidency, and sheds light on her own political brilliance and her blind spots\u2014especially her suspicion and mishandling of the press and her overt hostility to the opposition that clouded her entry into the capital. He untangles her relationship to Whitewater, Troopergate, and Travelgate. He leads us to understand the failure of her health care initiative.In the emotional and political chaos of the Lewinsky affair we see Hillary, despite her immense hurt and anger, standing by her husband\u2014evoking a rising wave of sympathy from a public previously cool to her. It helps carry her into the Senate, where she applies the political lessons she has learned. It is now her time. As she decides to run for president, her husband now her valued aide, she has one more chance to fulfill her ambition for herself\u2014to change the world.In his preparation for A Woman in Charge, Bernstein reexamined everything pertinent written about and by Hillary Clinton. He interviewed some two hundred of her colleagues, friends, and enemies and was allowed unique access to the candid record of the 1992 presidential campaign kept by Hillary\u2019s best friend, Diane Blair.He has given us a book that enables us, at last, to address the questions Americans are insistently\u2014even obsessively\u2014asking about Hillary Clinton: What is her character? What is her political philosophy? Who is she? What can we expect of her?",

And no one conducts a more harrowing and suspenseful manhunt than the modern Sherlock Holmes of the psyche, Dr. Alex Delaware. A tipsy young woman seeking aid on a desolate highway disappears into the inky black night. A retired schoolteacher is stabbed to death in broad daylight. Two women are butchered after closing time in a small-town beauty parlor. These and other bizarre acts of cruelty and psychopathology are linked only by the killer\u2019s use of luxury vehicles and a baffling lack of motive. The ultimate whodunits, these crimes demand the attention of LAPD detective Milo Sturgis and his collaborator on the crime beat, psychologist Alex Delaware.What begins with a solitary bloodstain in a stolen sedan quickly spirals outward in odd and unexpected directions, leading Delaware and Sturgis from the well-heeled center of L.A. society to its desperate edges; across the paths of commodities brokers and transvestite hookers; and as far away as New York City, where the search thaws out a long-cold case and exposes a grotesque homicidal crusade. The killer proves to be a fleeting shape-shifter, defying identification, leaving behind dazed witnesses and death\u2013and compelling Alex and Milo to confront the true face of murderous madness.From the Trade Paperback edition.",

It is my intention now to take you there in this book, if you have the courage to come with me.The young life of Daoud Hari\u2013his friends call him David\u2013has been one of bravery and mesmerizing adventure. He is a living witness to the brutal genocide under way in Darfur.The Translator is a suspenseful, harrowing, and deeply moving memoir of how one person has made a difference in the world\u2013an on-the-ground account of one of the biggest stories of our time. Using his high school knowledge of languages as his weapon\u2013while others around him were taking up arms\u2013Daoud Hari has helped inform the world about Darfur.Hari, a Zaghawa tribesman, grew up in a village in the Darfur region of Sudan. As a child he saw colorful weddings, raced his camels across the desert, and played games in the moonlight after his work was done. In 2003, this traditional life was shattered when helicopter gunships appeared over Darfur\u2019s villages, followed by Sudanese-government-backed militia groups attacking on horseback, raping and murdering citizens and burning villages. Ancient hatreds and greed for natural resources had collided, and the conflagration spread.Though Hari\u2019s village was attacked and destroyedhis family decimated and dispersed, he himself escaped. Roaming the battlefield deserts on camels, he and a group of his friends helped survivors find food, water, and the way to safety. When international aid groups and reporters arrived, Hari offered his services as a translator and guide.  In doing so, he risked his life again and again, for the government of Sudan had outlawed journalists in the region, and death was the punishment for those who aided the \u201cforeign spies.\u201d And then, inevitably, his luck ran out and he was captured. . . . The Translator tells the remarkable story of a man who came face-to-face with genocide\u2013 time and again risking his own life to fight injustice and save his people.",

Mistresses of some of the grandest houses in England and Ireland - Holland House, Leinster House, Carton and Castletown - their lives were splendidly magnificent. They left behind not just a vast written archive, but the portraits, furniture, houses and gardens that they had commissioned, bought and created. This volume, which accompanies the TV drama series, not only portrays their treasure trove of houses, objects and paintings but also uses stills taken on location to show the actors in their settings and costumes. In her text Stella Tillyard uses new material from the sisters' letters to take us deep into their opinions, tastes and habits and to describe how and where they bought their furniture and found their gardeners and how they filled their days in country and in town.",

As 1930s fascism spreads  over Czechoslovakia, Zoli and her grandfather flee to join a clan of fellow Romani  harpists. Sharpened by the world of books, which is often frowned upon in the Romani  tradition, Zoli becomes the poster girl for a brave new world. As she shapes the  ancient songs to her times, she finds her gift embraced by the Gypsy people and savored  by a young English expatriate, Stephen Swann.  But Zoli soon finds that when she  falls she cannot fall halfway\u2013neither in love nor in politics. While Zoli\u2019s fame  and poetic skills deepen, the ruling Communists begin to use her for their own favor.  Cast out from her family, Zoli abandons her past to journey to the West, in a novel  that spans the 20th century and travels the breadth of Europe.Colum McCann has created a sensuous novel about exile, belonging and survival, based loosely on the true story of the Romani poet Papusza. It spans the twentieth century and travels the breadth of Europe. In the tradition of Steinbeck, Coetzee, and Ondaatje, McCann finds the art inherent in social and political history, while vividly depicting how far one gifted woman must journey to find where she belongs.Praise for Zoli\u201cVery powerful . . . rich in vivid detail . . . the prose is just plain gorgeous. . . .

        "Title": "Windy City: A Novel of Politics",
        "Authors": "By Simon, Scott",
        "Description": "The acclaimed author of the intensely powerful novel Pretty Birds, Scott Simon now gives us a story that is both laugh-out-loud funny and heart-piercing\u2013as sprawling and brawling as Chicago, where politics is a contact sport.The mayor of Chicago is found in his office late at night, sitting in his boxer shorts, facedown dead in a pizza. The mayor was a hero and a rascal: dynamic, charming, ingenious, corruptible, and a masterly manipulator. The city mourns. But it\u2019s discovered that the mayor was murdered\u2013shortly after he may have begun to squeal on some of his colleagues at City Hall. Over the next four days, police race to find the mayor\u2019s killer, while the politicians who bemoan his passing scramble for his throne. At the center is Sundaran \u201cSunny\u201d Roopini, forty-eight, alderman of the Forty-eighth Ward, and vice-mayor. Sunny is an Indian immigrant, a restaurant owner, and a recent widower. He is getting tired of politics and wants to hold on just long enough to do the best for his two restive teenage daughters. But as acting interim mayor for a few days, Sunny must deal with forty-nine other aldermen who have their own clashing ambitions.How will Sunny do what\u2019s best for both his family and city in a time of crisis?As The Last Hurrah embodied urban politics for a previous generation, Windy City captures politics in the multiethnic tumult of today\u2019s big city, where a stalled subway raises fears of a terrorist attack and smoke-filled rooms are abolished by no-smoking statutes. The story takes a raft of colorful characters\u2013pinky-ringed pols, pious reformers, money-grubbers, and wheeler-dealers of every creed, color, and proclivity\u2013through City Hall corridors, neighborhood restaurants and clubs, weddings, sex scandals, gospel churches, police stations, and sting operations to deliver an ending that is unexpectedly noble.Windy City is a roller coaster of a novel that dips and soars through the amusement park of politics. With echoes of Primary Colors and Thank You for Smoking, Windy City will win votes as the best political novel in many years. Its personal story\u2013about a flawed, decent man thrust suddenly under hot lights\u2013will also win hearts.Praise for Windy City: \u201cDelectable\u2026 Offers an insider\u2019s view of the kind of urban political fray\u2013albeit fictional\u2013that Barack Obama emerged from as an Illinois state legislator representing Chicago\u2019s South Side\u2026.

L\u2019Enfant approached this task with unparalleled vigor and passion; however, his imperious and unyielding nature also made him many powerful enemies. After eleven months, Washington reluctantly dismissed L\u2019Enfant from the project. Subsequently, the plan for the city was published under another name, and L\u2019Enfant died long before it was rightfully attributed to him. Filled with incredible characters and passionate human drama, Scott W. Berg\u2019s deft narrative account of this little-explored story in American history is a tribute to the genius of Pierre Charles L'Enfant and the enduring city that is his legacy.",

        "Description": "Who is Jesus Christ? In The Third Jesus, bestselling author and spiritual leader Deepak Chopra provides an answer to this question that is both a challenge to current systems of belief and a fresh perspective on what Jesus can teach us all, regardless of our religious background. There is not one Jesus, Chopra writes, but three.First, there is the historical Jesus, the man who lived more than two thousand years ago and whose teachings are the foundation of Christian theology and thought. Next there is Jesus the Son of God, who has come to embody an institutional religion with specific dogma, a priesthood, and devout believers. And finally, there is the third Jesus, the cosmic Christ, the spiritual guide whose teaching embraces all humanity, not just the church built in his name. He speaks to the individual who wants to find God as a personal experience, to attain what some might call grace, or God-consciousness, or enlightenment. When we take Jesus literally, we are faced with the impossible. How can we truly \u201clove thy neighbor as thyself\u201d? But when we see the exhortations of Jesus as invitations to join him on a higher spiritual plane, his words suddenly make sense.Ultimately, Chopra argues, Christianity needs to overcome its tendency to be exclusionary and refocus on being a religion of personal insight and spiritual growth. In this way Jesus can be seen for the universal teacher he truly is\u2013someone whose teachings of compassion, tolerance, and understanding can embrace and be embraced by all of us.",

        "Authors": "By Bennett, Robert S.",
        "Description": "Robert S. Bennett has been a lawyer for more than forty years. In that time, he\u2019s taken on dozens of high-pro?le and groundbreaking cases and emerged as the go-to guy for the nation\u2019s elite. Bob Bennett gained international recognition as one of America\u2019s best lawyers for leading the defense of President Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones case. But long before, and ever since, representing a sitting president, he has fought for justice for many famous (and some now infamous) clients. This is his story.Born in Brooklyn and an amateur boxer in his youth, Bennett has always brought his street ?ghter\u2019s mentality to the courtroom. His case history is a who\u2019s who of ?gures who have dominated legal headlines: super lobbyist Tommy Corcoran, former Secretaries of Defense Clark Clifford and Caspar Weinberger, Marge Schott, and, most recently, New York Times reporter Judith Miller and former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz. Bennett also served as special counsel to the Senate during the ABSCAM and Keating Five scandals and was a leading member of the National Review Board for the Protection of Children & Young People, created by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in response to the sex abuse allegations.Taking the reader deep within his most intriguing and dif?cult cases, In the Ring shows how Bennett has argued for what\u2019s right, won for his clients, and effected his share of change on the system. This is an intimate and compelling memoir of one lawyer\u2019s attempt to ?ght hard and fair.",

Henrik turns out to have led multiple lives and held many secrets - including his HIV-positive status - that she knew nothing about, and part of her shock over his death stems from the realization that he concealed so much from her. Louise is convinced his death cannot be a suicide, and her grief and anger become an all-consuming desire to know who her son really was and what could have left him dead at the age of twenty-eight. Her investigation takes her to Spain, Australia, and, in her most disorienting and perilous trip, Mozambique, home to a sinister AIDS hospice run by a powerful philanthropist who is somehow linked to Henrik. Her travels also bring her closer and closer to a danger she cannot yet understand, while those who dare to help her put their lives at risk.",

Each seeks to come to terms with his identity or to remake it altogether. Henry\u2019s task is especially daunting: He is determined to live as an American, free of the shackles of his hideous past.

        "Description": "This is the book that cracks the code of the Bush presidency. Unstintingly yet compassionately, and with no political ax to grind, Slate editor in chief Jacob Weisberg methodically and objectively examines the family and circle of advisers who played crucial parts in George W. Bush\u2019s historic downfall.In this revealing and defining portrait, Weisberg uncovers the \u201cblack box\u201d from the crash of the Bush presidency. Using in-depth research, revealing analysis, and keen psychological acuity, Weisberg explores the whole Bush story. Distilling all that has been previously written about Bush into a defining portrait, he illuminates the fateful choices and key decisions that led George W., and thereby the country, into its current predicament. Weisberg gives the tragedy a historical and literary frame, comparing Bush not just to previous American leaders, but also to Shakespeare\u2019s Prince Hal, who rises from ne\u2019er-do-well youth to become the warrior king Henry V.Here is the bitter and fascinating truth of the early years of the Bush dynasty, with never-before-revealed information about the conflict between the two patriarchs on George W.\u2019s father\u2019s side of the family\u2013the one an upright pillar of the community, the other a rowdy playboy\u2013and how that schism would later shape and twist the younger George Bush; his father, a hero of war, business, and Republican politics whose accomplishments George W. would attempt to copy and whose absences he would resent; his mother, Barbara, who suffered from insecurity, depression, and deep dissatisfaction with her role as housewife; and his younger brother Jeb, seen by his parents as steadier, stronger, and the son most likely to succeed.Weisberg also anatomizes the replacement family Bush surrounded himself with in Washington, a group he thought could help him correct the mistakes he felt had destroyed his father\u2019s presidency: Karl Rove, who led Bush astray by pursuing his own historical ambitions and transforming the president into a deeply polarizing figure; Dick Cheney, whose obsessive quest to restore presidential power and protect the country after 9/11 caused Bush and America to lose the world\u2019s respect; and, finally, Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice, who encouraged Bush\u2019s foreign policy illusions and abetted his flight from reality.  Delving as no other biography has into Bush\u2019s religious beliefs\u2013which are presented as at once opportunistic and sincere\u2013The Bush Tragedy is an essential work that is sure to become a standard reference for any future assessment. It is the most balanced and compelling account of a sitting president ever written.",

In the aftermath of his disappearance, his mother, Lorraine, makes daily pilgrimages to her son\u2019s room and tortures herself with memories. Equally distraught, the boy\u2019s father, Lincoln, finds himself wanting to comfort his wife even as he yearns for solace, a loving touch, any kind of intimacy. As the Ewings navigate the mystery of what\u2019s become of their son, the circumstances surrounding Newell\u2019s vanishing and other events on that same night reverberate through the lives of seemingly disconnected strangers: a comic book illustrator in town for a weekend of debauchery; a painfully shy and possibly disturbed young artist; a stripper who imagines moments from her life as if they were movie scenes; a bubbly teenage wiccan anarchist; a dangerous and scheming gutter punk; a band of misfit runaways. The people of Beautiful Children are \u201curban nomads,\u201d each with a past to hide and a pain to nurture, every one of them searching for salvation and barreling toward destruction, weaving their way through a neon underworld of sex, drugs, and the spinning wheels of chance. In this masterly debut novel, Charles Bock mixes incandescent prose with devious humor to capture Las Vegas with unprecedented scope and nuance and to provide a glimpse into a microcosm of modern America. Beautiful Children is an odyssey of heartache and redemption\u2013heralding the arrival of a major new writer.Advance praise for Beautiful Children\u201cCharles Bock has delivered an anxious, angry, honest first novel filled with compassion and clarity. Beautiful Children is fast, violent, sexy and\u2013like a potentially dangerous ride\u2013it could crash at any moment but never does. The language has a rhythm wholly its own\u2013at moments it is stunning, near genius. This book is big and wild\u2013it is as though Bock saved up everything for this moment. A major new talent.\u201d\u2013A. M.

Charles Bock has written a masterpiece: tragic, comic, sexy, chilling, far-reaching, and wise\u2013at once an accusation and a consolation, and a lucid portrait of what is happening at the very heart of our culture, and what it means to be a young American today.\u201d\u2013Sean Wilsey",

        "Title": "Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World",
        "Authors": "By Clinton, Bill and Clinton, Bill (NRT)",
        "Description": "Here, from Bill Clinton, is a call to action. Giving is an inspiring look at how each of us can change the world. First, it reveals the extraordinary and innovative efforts now being made by companies and organizations\u2014and by individuals\u2014to solve problems and save lives both \u201cdown the street and around the world.\u201d Then it urges us to seek out what each of us, \u201cregardless of income, available time, age, and skills,\u201d can do to help, to give people a chance to live out their dreams.Bill Clinton shares his own experiences and those of other givers, representing a global flood tide of nongovernmental, nonprofit activity. These remarkable stories demonstrate that gifts of time, skills, things, and ideas are as important and effective as contributions of money. From Bill and Melinda Gates to a six-year-old California girl named McKenzie Steiner, who organized and supervised drives to clean up the beach in her community, Clinton introduces us to both well-known and unknown heroes of giving. Among them:Dr. Paul Farmer, who grew up living in the family bus in a trailer park, vowed to devote his life to giving high-quality medical care to the poor and has built innovative public health-care clinics first in Haiti and then in Rwanda;a New York couple, in Africa for a wedding, who visited several schools in Zimbabwe and were appalled by the absence of textbooks and school supplies. They founded their own organization to gather and ship materials to thirty-five schools. After three years, the percentage of seventh-graders who pass reading tests increased from 5 percent to 60 percent;'Oseola McCarty, who after seventy-five years of eking out a living by washing and ironing, gave $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi to endow a scholarship fund for African-American students;Andre Agassi, who has created a college preparatory academy in the Las Vegas neighborhood with the city\u2019s highest percentage of at-risk kids. \u201cTennis was a stepping-stone for me,\u201d says Agassi. \u201cChanging a child\u2019s life is what I always wanted to do\u201d;Heifer International, which gave twelve goats to a Ugandan village. Within a year, Beatrice Biira\u2019s mother had earned enough money selling goat\u2019s milk to pay Beatrice\u2019s school fees and eventually to send all her children to school\u2014and, as required, to pass on a baby goat to another family, thus multiplying the impact of the gift.Clinton writes about men and women who traded in their corporate careers, and the fulfillment they now experience through giving. He writes about energy-efficient practices, about progressive companies going green, about promoting fair wages and decent working conditions around the world. He shows us how one of the most important ways of giving can be an effort to change, improve, or protect a government policy. He outlines what we as individuals can do, the steps we can take, how much we should consider giving, and why our giving is so important.Bill Clinton\u2019s own actions in his post-presidential years have had an enormous impact on the lives of millions. Through his foundation and his work in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, he has become an international spokesperson and model for the power of giving.\u201cWe all have the capacity to do great things,\u201d President Clinton says. \u201cMy hope is that the people and stories in this book will lift spirits, touch hearts, and demonstrate that citizen activism and service can be a powerful agent of change in the world.\u201d",

If all he suspects is true, what should he do?Never sentimental, His Illegal Self is an achingly beautiful story of the love between a young woman and a little boy.

The sole survivor of the mission, Taylor is haunted by what he's sure he saw but still can't prove exists - Carcharodon megalodon, the massive mother of the great white shark. The average prehistoric Meg weighs in at twenty tons and could tear apart a Tyrannosaurus rex in seconds.Written off as a crackpot, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Taylor refuses to forget the depths that nearly cost him his life. With a Ph.D. in paleontology under his belt, Taylor spends years theorizing, lecturing, and writing about the possibility that Meg still feeds at the deepest levels of the sea. But it takes an old friend in need to get him to return to the water, and a hotshot female submarine pilot to dare him back into a high-tech miniature sub.Diving deeper than he ever has before, Taylor will face terror like he's never imagined, and what he finds could turn the tides bloody red until the end of time.",

        "Description": "\u201cI finally understand what the poets have written. In spring, moved to passion; in autumn only regret.\u201dFor young Peony, betrothed to a suitor she has never met, these lyrics from The Peony Pavilion mirror her own longings. In the garden of the Chen Family Villa, amid the scent of ginger, green tea, and jasmine, a small theatrical troupe is performing scenes from this epic opera, a live spectacle few females have ever seen. Like the heroine in the drama, Peony is the cloistered daughter of a wealthy family, trapped like a good-luck cricket in a bamboo-and-lacquer cage. Though raised to be obedient, Peony has dreams of her own.Peony\u2019s mother is against her daughter\u2019s attending the production: \u201cUnmarried girls should not be seen in public.\u201d But Peony\u2019s father assures his wife that proprieties will be maintained, and that the women will watch the opera from behind a screen. Yet through its cracks, Peony catches sight of an elegant, handsome man with hair as black as a cave\u2013and is immediately overcome with emotion.So begins Peony\u2019s unforgettable journey of love and destiny, desire and sorrow\u2013as Lisa See\u2019s haunting new novel, based on actual historical events, takes readers back to seventeenth-century China, after the Manchus seize power and the Ming dynasty is crushed. Steeped in traditions and ritual, this story brings to life another time and place\u2013even the intricate realm of the afterworld, with its protocols, pathways, and stages of existence, a vividly imagined place where one\u2019s soul is divided into three, ancestors offer guidance, misdeeds are punished, and hungry ghosts wander the earth. Immersed in the richness and magic of the Chinese vision of the afterlife, transcending even death, Peony in Love explores, beautifully, the many manifestations of love. Ultimately, Lisa See\u2019s new novel addresses universal themes: the bonds of friendship, the power of words, and the age-old desire of women to be heard.",

        "Title": "President Lincoln: The Duty of a Statesman",
        "Authors": "By Miller, William Lee",
        "Description": "The American president has come to be the most powerful figure in the world\u2014and back in the nineteenth century a great man held that office. William Lee Miller\u2019s new book closely examines that great man in that hugely important office: Abraham Lincoln as president.Wars waged by American presidents have come to be pivotal historical events. Here Miller analyzes the commander in chief who coped with the profound moral dilemmas of America\u2019s bloodiest war.In his acclaimed book Lincoln\u2019s Virtues (\u201cA fascinating account, sensitively written, rich in insight\u201d \u2014Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.), Miller explored Abraham Lincoln\u2019s intellectual and moral development. Now he completes his \u201cethical biography,\u201d showing the amiable and inexperienced backcountry politician transformed by constitutional alchemy into an oath-bound head of state, slapped in the face from the first minute of his presidency by decisions of the utmost gravity and confronted by the radical moral contradiction left by the nation\u2019s Founders: universal ideals of Equality and Liberty and the monstrous injustice of human slavery.With wit and penetrating sensitivity, Miller shows us a Lincoln with unusual intellectual power, as he brings together the great themes that will be his legend\u2014preserving the United States of America while ending the odious institution that corrupted the nation\u2019s meaning. Miller finds in this superb politician a remarkable presidential combination: an indomitable resolve, combined with the judgment that keeps it from being mindless stubbornness; and a supreme magnanimity, combined with the discriminating judgment that keeps it from being sentimentality. Here is the realistic war leader persisting after multiple defeats, pressing his generals to take the battle to the enemy, insisting that the objective was the destruction of Lee\u2019s army and not the capture of territory, saying that breath alone kills no rebels, remarking that he regretted war does not admit of holy days, asking whether one could believe that he would strike lighter blows rather than heavier ones, or leave any card unplayed. And here is the pardoner, finding every excuse to keep from shooting the simple soldier boy who deserts. Here too is the eloquent leader who describes the national task in matchless prose, and who rises above vindictiveness and triumphalism as he guides the nation to a new birth of freedom.",
