        "Description": "A wake-up call for a national crisis in parenting--and a deeply helpful book for those who want to see their own behaviors as parents with the greatest possible clarity.Harvard psychologist RichardWeissbourd argues incisively that parents\u2014not peers, not television\u2014are the primary shapers of their children\u2019s moral lives. And yet, it is parents\u2019 lack of self-awareness and confused priorities that are dangerously undermining children\u2019s development.Through the author\u2019s own original field research, including hundreds of rich, revealing conversations with children, parents, teachers, and coaches, a surprising picture emerges.Parents\u2019 intense focus on their children\u2019s happiness is turning many children into self-involved, fragile conformists.The suddenly widespread desire of parents to be closer to their children\u2014a heartening trend in many ways\u2014often undercuts kids\u2019morality.Our fixation with being great parents\u2014and our need for our children to reflect that greatness\u2014can actually make them feel ashamed for failing to measure up. Finally, parents\u2019 interactions with coaches and teachers\u2014and coaches\u2019 and teachers\u2019 interactions with children\u2014are critical arenas for nurturing, or eroding, children\u2019s moral lives.Weissbourd\u2019s ultimately compassionate message\u2014based on compelling new research\u2014is that the intense, crisis-filled, and profoundly joyous process of raising a child can be a powerful force for our own moral development.",

When it occurs to the king and queen that an elephant might be an appropriate wedding gift, everyone rushes to get them ready: Subhro is given two new suits of clothes and Solomon a long-overdue scrub.Accompanied by the archduke, his new bride, and the royal guard, our unlikely heroes traverse a continent riven by the Reformation and civil war.

Whether investigating a case or a problem of philosophy, the indefatigable Isabel Dalhousie, one of fiction\u2019s most richly developed amateur detectives, is always ready to pursue the answers to all of life\u2019s questions, large and small. In addition to being the nosiest and most sypathetic philosopher  you are likely to meet, Isabel is now a mother.  Charlies, her newborn son, presents  her with a myriad wonders of a new life, and doting father Jamie presents her with  an intriguing proposal: marriage.  In the midst of all this, she receives a disturbing  letter announcing that she has been ousted as editor of the Review of Applied Ethics by the ambitious Professor Dove.  None of these things, however, in any way diminshes  Isabel's curiosity.  And when she attends an art auction, she finds an irresistable  puzzle: two paintings attributed to a now-deceased artist appear on the market at  the same time, and both of them exhibit some unusual characteristics.  Are these  paintings forgeries? This proves to be sufficient fodder for Isabel's inquisitiveness.   So she begins an investigation... and soon finds herself diverging from her philosophical  musings about fatherhood onto a path that leads her into the mysteries of the art  world and the soul of an artist.",

        "Description": "The world has entered a second nuclear age.  For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the threat of nuclear annihilation is on the rise.  Should such an assault occur, there is a strong likelihood that the trail of devastation will lead back to Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani father of the Islamic bomb and the mastermind behind a vast clandestine enterprise that has sold nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.             Khan's loose-knit organization was and still may be a nuclear Wal-Mart, selling weapons blueprints, parts, and the expertise to assemble the works into a do-it-yourself bomb kit. Amazingly, American authorities could have halted his operation, but they chose instead to watch and wait.  Khan proved that the international safeguards the world relied on no longer worked.    Journalists Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins tell this alarming tale of international intrigue through the eyes of the European and American officials who suspected Khan, tracked him, and ultimately shut him down, but only after the nuclear genie was long out of the bottle.",

The normally lush, green countryside is in the grip of the worst drought in years: stunted cornstalks rasp in the hot July breeze, parched vegetable gardens wither and die, the Chittenden River shrinks to a trickle, and the drilling trucks are booked solid as one by one the wells give out.

In the midst of this crisis, Scottie Winston lobbies for permits to expand Powder Peak, a local ski area that's his law firm's principal client. As part of the expansion, the resort seeks to draw water for snowmaking from the beleaguered Chittenden, despite opposition from environmentalists who fear that the already weakened river will be damaged beyond repair.",

When Tempe finds herself regaining consciousness in some kind of very small, very dark, very cold enclosed space\u2014bound, hands to feet\u2014Tempe begins slowly to reconstruct...Tempe and Lieutenant Ryan had accompanied the recently discovered remains of a missing heiress from Montreal to the Chicago morgue. Suddenly, Tempe was accused of mishandling the autopsy\u2014and the case. Back in Montreal, the corpse of a second elderly woman was found in the woods, and then a third. Seamlessly weaving between Tempe\u2019s present-tense terror as she\u2019s held captive and her memory of the cases of these murdered women, Reichs reveals the incredible devastation that would occur if a forensic colleague sabotaged work in the lab. The chemistry between Tempe and Ryan intensifies as this complex, riveting tale unfolds, proving once again, that Reichs is the dominant talent in forensic mystery writing.",

        "Title": "Social Science as Civic Discourse: Essays on the Invention, Legitimation, and Uses of Social Theory",
        "Authors": "By Brown, Richard Harvey",
        "Description": "Richard Harvey Brown's pioneering explorations in the philosophy of social science and the theory of rhetoric reach a culmination in Social Science as Civic Discourse. In his earlier works, he argued for a logic of discovery and explanation in social science by showing that science and art both depend on metaphoric thinking, and he has applied that logic to society as a narrative text in which significant action by moral agents is possible. This new work is at once a philosophical critique of social theory and a social-theoretical critique of politics. Brown proposes to redirect the language and the mission of the social sciences toward a new discourse for a humane civic practice.",
