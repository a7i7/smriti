There's legend and lore about the colorful history of these peppers (a West Indies folktale describes how a mother inadvertently killed her children by using too much habanero in her broth!), and thorough listings of mail-order sources. As chock-full of inspiration as a well-stocked pantry, The Pepper Pantry: Habaneros is perfect for either beginning cooks or die-hard chile aficionados.",

This is never more clear than when she's invited to her fiftieth elementary-school reunion. \"Of course I'd go to the reunion.\" Beckerman says. But delight soon turns to dismay: \"I wondered who'd be there. How would they look? Would I look as good? What would I wear? Could I lose twenty pounds by June?\" Her reunion presents the perfect occasion to illustrate the anxieties and doubts, the dreams and hard-earned triumphs, of women\u2014from Queen Victoria to Britney Spears. Beckerman knows what really matters in life (besides good hair), and she imparts her wisdom in letters (unsent) to Madonna, Ava Gardner, Sofia Coppola, Meryl Streep, Gwyneth Paltrow, and others, and to her granddaughter Olivia. Frida Kahlo, Cinderella, Whistler's Mother, and Audrey Hepburn make appearances too. In this wise and wonderful book, she shares a lifetime of experience that reminds us that, ultimately, our mothers (and our grandmothers) were right: real beauty comes from within.",

Now, rumors have begun to surface of a new work by this aging but still acute mind. Yet unlike his earlier work, this book will not examine the mind of the average man, but the mind of the serial killer.Detective Hanno Stiffeniis has been called to the city to find the culprit in an enigmatic string of murders. Are they part of a plot formed by Napoleon's spies to undermine the Prussian king, or the work of a solitary killer? The case would seem unsolvable, were it not for the assistance and unmatched intellect of his mentor, Immanuel Kant. Together the young detective and the elderly, eccentric philosopher must track down the killer who has the city by the throat.Atmospheric, entertaining, and intelligent, this acclaimed novel is sophisticated, page-turning crime at its best.",

Along the way he married Spice Girl Victoria \"Posh\" Adams, and together they inhabit a celebrity whirlwind of Diana-esque proportions. In Both Feet on the Ground, David talks candidly about the perils of fame (his wife and son were the targets of a notorious kidnapping plot and he is the subject of almost daily tabloid rumors); the struggle to balance his roles as a devoted husband and besotted father with his globetrotting existence as an international soccer star; the behind-the-scenes stories of his most memorable and heartbreaking (if only he could retake that infamous penalty kick against Portugal in Euro 2004) career moments; the controversy surrounding his first year at Real Madrid after his $41 million transfer from Manchester United, the storied English team he joined as a teenager and led for more than a decade; and, finally, his love of America, where he plans to start a soccer school and perhaps, one day, even play professionally.Both Feet on the Ground is David Beckham's own extraordinary story, told by the man who knows him best -- David Beckham.",
