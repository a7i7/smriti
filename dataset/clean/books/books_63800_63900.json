This is more of a \"get off your butt and get to work\" approach that can help you achieve more success, make more money, improve your business, and have more fun.Larry Winget doesn't pull any punches here. He believes that business gets better when businesspeople get better through personal growth. And it works the same way in your personal life-husbands and wives improve each other when they improve themselves, and kids improve when their parents do. In other words, everything in life gets better when you get better, and nothing gets better until you get better.This book can make you better, but it will probably tick you off. Winget is direct, caustic, and controversial. You won't like or agree with everything he has to say. Yet his advice is full of wisdom and truth that can't easily be argued with.Words from Shut Up, Stop Whining & Get a Life that prove that this book is anything but typical:\"If you don't have much going wrong in your life, then you don't have much going on in your life.\"\"When you work, work! When you play, play! Don't mix the two.\"\"What you think about, talk about, and do something about is what comes about.\"\"When it quits being fun-quit.\"\"Time management is a joke.\"And that's just the beginning!",

        "Description": "Tapping the potential of the changing workforce, consumer base, and citizenry requires a leadership approach that resonates with our country's growing diversity. In \"\"Salsa, Soul, and Spirit,\"\" Juana Bordas shows how incorporating Latino, African American, and American Indian approaches to leadership into the mainstream has the potential to strengthen leadership practices and inspire today's ethnically rich workforce. Bordas identifies eight core leadership principles common to all three cultures, principles deeply rooted in each culture's values and developed under the most trying conditions. Using a lively blend of personal reflections, interviews, and historical background, she shows how these principles developed and illustrates the creative ways they've been put into practice in these communities (and some forward-looking companies). Bordas brings these principles together into a multicultural leadership model that offers a more flexible and inclusive way to lead and a new vision of the role of the leader in the organization. Multicultural leadership resonates with many cultures and encourages diverse people to actively engage. In a globalized economy, success for leaders in the future will rest on their ability to shift to a multicultural approach. \"\"Salsa, Soul, and Spirit\"\" provides conceptual and practical guidelines for beginning that process.",
