        "Title": "Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age",
        "Authors": "By Shirky, Clay",
        "Description": "The author of the breakout hit Here Comes Everybody reveals how new technology is changing us from consumers to collaborators, unleashing a torrent of creative production that will transform our world.   For decades, technology encouraged people to squander their time and intellect as passive consumers. Today, tech has finally caught up with human potential. In Cognitive Surplus, Internet guru Clay Shirky forecasts the thrilling changes we will all enjoy as new digital technology puts our untapped resources of talent and goodwill to use at last.  Since we Americans were suburbanized and educated by the postwar boom, we've had a surfeit of intellect, energy, and time-what Shirky calls a cognitive surplus. But this abundance had little impact on the common good because television consumed the lion's share of it-and we consume TV passively, in isolation from one another. Now, for the first time, people are embracing new media that allow us to pool our efforts at vanishingly low cost. The results of this aggregated effort range from mind expanding-reference tools like Wikipedia-to lifesaving-such as Ushahidi.com, which has allowed Kenyans to sidestep government censorship and report on acts of violence in real time.  Shirky argues persuasively that this cognitive surplus-rather than being some strange new departure from normal behavior-actually returns our society to forms of collaboration that were natural to us up through the early twentieth century. He also charts the vast effects that our cognitive surplus-aided by new technologies-will have on twenty-first-century society, and how we can best exploit those effects. Shirky envisions an era of lower creative quality on average but greater innovation, an increase in transparency in all areas of society, and a dramatic rise in productivity that will transform our civilization.  The potential impact of cognitive surplus is enormous. As Shirky points out, Wikipedia was built out of roughly 1 percent of the man-hours that Americans spend watching TV every year. Wikipedia and other current products of cognitive surplus are only the iceberg's tip. Shirky shows how society and our daily lives will be improved dramatically as we learn to exploit our goodwill and free time like never before.Watch a Video",

The success of the first four editions of Global Business Today has been based in part upon the incorporation of leading edge research into the text, the use of the up-to-date examples and statistics to illustrate global trends and enterprise strategy, and the discussion of current events within the context of the appropriate theory. Notable additions to the 5th Edition include: * Chapter 5 has been updated to discuss progress on the current round of talks sponsored by the WTO aimed at reducing barriers to trade, particularly in agriculture (the Doha Round). * Chapter 6 now discusses the slump in foreign direct investment flows that took place in 2001-2004. * The section on the European Union in Chapter 8 has been revised to reflect the fact that ten more member states were admitted on May 1st, 2004.  Our research has shown that students and instructors alike enjoy the interesting, informative, and accessible writing style of GBT - so much so that the writing has become Charles Hill's trademark. In addition to boxed material which provides deep illustrations in every chapter, Hill carefully weaves interesting anecdotes into the narrative of the text to engage the reader.",

Although his grandfather lost the family's land and castle in a card game when Angus was just a boy, Angus takes his duties seriously and is respected by all the men and adored by the women. That is, until Edilean Talbot shows up.Breathtakingly beautiful and born of privilege, Edilean represents everything Angus despises. Still he is as dazzled by her as everyone else is, and he can keep his feelings hidden from her for only so long. When she rejects him he is deeply wounded and, worse, humiliated before his clan. But then the day comes when Edilean needs Angus's help, to reclaim the gold she inherited from her father, which is on its way to America. At first Angus refuses, but her beauty -- and her tears -- so haunt him that he puts aside his pride and decides to aid the heiress. However, when Angus tries to intervene, he's accused of kidnapping and theft. To avoid being prosecuted, he's forced to leave behind all that he knows and loves and escape with Edilean to America. There they will overcome almost insurmountable obstacles as they are pursued endlessly by the man who claims the gold for his own. Despite all that tries to keep them apart, Angus and Edilean also find a love as wild and free as the land itself.The second book in the multigenerational Edilean Series that began with Lavender Morning, Days of Gold is filled with passion, humor, exquisite detail, and pulse-pounding adventure.

The Facebook Effect effectively shows its rapid evolution, where it is going, and how it will increasingly affect our lives.\"-Craig Newmark, founder of Craiglist\"David Kirkpatrick recounts in fastidious and fascinating detail the breakneck development of this 21st-century phenomenon. Facebook's capacity to galvanize human behavior has already had vast and irreversible consequences for society, politics, and marketing. There will be many more to come-accompanied, it seems certain, by some degree of turbulence. It's a fascinating story-and it's only six years old.\"-Martin Sorrell, CEO, WPP Group\"It's fun to read this amazing story of how Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and made it huge worldwide. It's also a brilliant window into what it takes to be a successful internet entrepreneur.\"-Marc Benioff, Founder and CEO, Salesforce.comIn Little More Than Half A Decade, Facebook has gone from a dorm-room novelty to a company with 500 million users. It is one of the fastest growing companies in history, an essential part of the social life not only of teenagers but hundreds of millions of adults worldwide. As Facebook spreads around the globe, it creates surprising effects\u00f9even becoming instrumental in political protests from Colombia to Iran.Veteran technology reporter David Kirkpatrick had the full cooperation of Facebook's key executives in researching this fascinating history of the company and its impact on our lives. Kirkpatrick tells us how Facebook was created, why it has flourished, and where it is going next. He chronicles its successes and missteps, and gives readers the most complete assessment anywhere of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the central figure in the company's remarkable ascent. This is the Facebook story that can be found nowhere else.How did a nineteen-year-old Harvard student create a company that has transformed the Internet and how did he grow it to its current enormous size? Kirkpatrick shows how Zuckerberg steadfastly refused to compromise his vision, insistently focusing on growth over profits and preaching that Facebook must dominate (his word) communication on the Internet. In the process, he and a small group of key executives have created a company that has changed social life in the United States and elsewhere, a company that has become a ubiquitous presence in marketing, altering politics, business, and even our sense of our own identity. This is the Facebook Effect.",

        "Description": "From the humble heights of a Class-A pitcher's mound to the deflating lows of sleeping on his gun-toting grandmother's air mattress, veteran reliever Dirk Hayhurst steps out of the bullpen to deliver the best pitch of his career--a raw, unflinching and surprisingly moving account of his life in the minors.I enjoyed the visualizations, maybe a little too much, and would stop only when I felt I'd centered myself.  .  .or after one of my teammates hit me in the nuts with the rosin bag while my eyes were closed.Hilariously self-effacing and brutally honest, Hayhurst captures the absurdities, the grim realities, and the occasional nuggets of hard-won wisdom culled from four seasons in the minors. Whether training tarantulas to protect his room from thieving employees in a backwater hotel, watching the raging battles fought between his partially paralyzed father and his alcoholic brother, or absorbing the gentle mockery of some not-quite-starstruck schoolchildren, Dirk reveals a side of baseball, and life, rarely seen on ESPN.My career has crash-landed on the floor of my grandma's old sewing room. If this is a dream come true, then dreams smell a lot like mothballs and Bengay.Somewhere between Bull Durham and The Rookie, The Bullpen Gospels takes an unforgettable trot around the inglorious base paths of minor league baseball, where an inch separates a ball from a strike, and a razor-thin margin can be the difference between The Show or a long trip home.\"It's not often that someone comes along who is a good pitcher and a good writer.\" --King Kaufman, Salon\"After many minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years spent in the bullpen, I can verify that this is a true picture of baseball.\"--Tim McCarver\"There are great truths within, of the kind usually unspoken. And as he expresses them, Dirk Hayhurst describes himself as 'a real person who moonlights as a baseball player.' In much the same manner, while The Bullpen Gospels chronicles how all of us face the impact when we learn reality is both far meaner and far richer than our dreams--it also moonlights as one of the best baseball books ever written.\"--Keith Olbermann\"A bit of Jim Bouton, a bit of Jim Brosnan, a bit of Pat Jordan, a bit of crash Davis, and a whole lot of Dirk Hayhurst.  Often hilarious, sometimes poignant.  This is a really enjoyable baseball read.\"--Bob Costas\"Fascinating.  .  .a perspective that fans rarely see.\"--Trevor Hoffman, pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers \"The Bullpen Gospels is a rollicking good bus ride of a book. Hayhurst illuminates a baseball life not only with wit and humor, but also with thought-provoking introspection.\"--Tom Verducci, Sports Illustrated\"Dirk Hayhurst has written a fascinating, funny and honest account on life in the minor leagues. I loved it. Writers can't play baseball, but in this case, a player sure can write.\"--Tim Kurkjian, Senior Writer, ESPN The Magazine, analyst/reporter ESPN television\"Bull Durham meets Ball Four in Dirk Hayhurst's hilarious and moving account of life in baseball's glamour-free bush leagues.\"--Rob Neyer, ESPN.com\"If Holden Caulfield could dial up his fastball to 90 mph, he might have written this funny, touching memoir about a ballplayer at a career--and life--crossroads. He might have called it 'Pitcher in the Rye.' Instead, he left it to Dirk Hayhurst, the only writer in the business who can make you laugh, make you cry and strike out Ryan Howard.\"--King Kaufman, Salon\"The Bullpen Gospels is a funny bone-tickling, tear duct-stimulating, feel-good story that will leave die-hard baseball fans--and die-hard human beings, for that matter--well, feeling good.\"--Bob Mitchell, author of Once Upon a Fastball Dirk Hayhurst is a part time professional baseball player who enjoys comic books, video games, and a good sugar high.

Intimate, hilarious, and sobering, Wishful Drinking is Fisher, looking at her life as she best remembers it (what do you expect after electroshock therapy?). It's an incredible tale: the child of Hollywood royalty -- Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher -- homewrecked by Elizabeth Taylor, marrying (then divorcing, then dating) Paul Simon, having her likeness merchandized on everything from Princess Leia shampoo to PEZ dispensers, learning the father of her daughter forgot to tell her he was gay, and ultimately waking up one morning and finding a friend dead beside her in bed.  Wishful Drinking, the show, has been a runaway success. Entertainment Weekly declared it \"drolly hysterical\" and the Los Angeles Times called it a \"Beverly Hills yard sale of juicy anecdotes.\" This is Carrie Fisher at her best -- revealing her worst. She tells her true and outrageous story of her bizarre reality with her inimitable wit, unabashed self-deprecation, and buoyant, infectious humor.",

        "Description": "Head of the Sex Crimes Unit of the district attorney's office in Manhattan for decades, Linda Fairstein is America's   most visible legal expert on sexual assault and domestic violence-which is why she writes some of the most   compelling crime thrillers of our time and why her Alexandra Cooper series has been topping bestseller list for more   than a decade. Fans turn to Fairstein for ripped-from-the-headline crimes, cutting-edge investigations, and   vindication for victims. Linda Fairstein brings readers inside a world of which they can't get enough, but one they   hope to never see in real life. And for her twelfth novel, Fairstein takes Alexandra Cooper inside a world   she'd rather not see. New York City politics have always been filled with intrigue and behind-  the-scenes deals. In Hell Gate, Alex finds her attention torn between investigating a shipwreck that has   contraband cargo-human cargo-and the political sex scandal of a promising New York congressman now fallen   from grace. When Alex discovers that a woman from the wreck and the congressman's lover have the same rose   tattoo-the brand of a \"snakehead\", a master of a human trafficking operation-it dawns on her that these cases   aren't as unrelated as they seem and that the entire political landscape of New York City could hang in the balance of   her investigation. As Alex looks on at the nameless victims in the morgue, she realizes she's looking at the present-  day face of New York's long, dark tradition of human trafficking-a tradition that began hundreds of years ago with   slave trade from Africa, now a multimillion-dollar industry that will stop at no cost, even if that cost is Alex's   life.

        "Description": "\u201cExcellent.\u201d\u2014The Wall Street JournalSince its publication ten years ago, businesspeople, investors, doctors, parents, students, athletes, and musicians at every level have adopted the maxims of Talent Is Overrated to get better at what they\u2019re passionate about. Now this classic has been updated and revised with new research and takeaways to help anyone achieve even greater performance. \u00a0 Why are certain people so incredibly great at what they do? Most of us think we know the answer\u2014but we\u2019re almost always wrong. That\u2019s important, because if we\u2019re wrong on this crucial question, then we have zero chance of getting significantly better at anything we care about. Happily, the real source of great performance is no longer a mystery. Bringing together extensive scientific research, bestselling author Geoff Colvin shows where we go wrong and what actually makes world-class performers so remarkable. It isn\u2019t specific, innate talent, nor is it plain old hard work. It\u2019s a very specific type of work that anyone can do\u2014but most people don\u2019t. What\u2019s more, the principles of great performance apply to virtually any activity that matters to you. Readers worldwide have been inspired by this book\u2019s liberating message: You don\u2019t need a one-in-a-million natural gift. Better performance, and maybe even world-class performance, is closer than you think.",

Christensen exposed this crushing paradox behind the failure of many industry leaders: by placing too much focus on pleasing their most profitable customers, these firms actually paved the way for their own demise by ignoring the disruptive technologies that aggressively evolved to displace them. In The Innovator\u2019s Solution, Christensen and coauthor Michael E. Raynor help all companies understand how to become disruptors themselves.Clay Christensen (author of the award-winning Harvard Business Review article, &#147;How Will You Measure Your Life?\u201d) and Raynor not only reveal that innovation is more predictable than most managers have come to believe, they also provide helpful advice on the business decisions crucial to truly disruptive growth. Citing in-depth research and theories tested in hundreds of companies across many industries, the authors identify the processes that create successful innovation&#151;and they show managers how to tailor their strategies to the changing circumstances of a dynamic world.The Innovator\u2019s Solution is an important addition to any innovation library.Published by Harvard Business Review Press.",

        "Description": "Environmental issues affect every part of your life. ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE: WORKING WITH THE EARTH, Twelfth Edition, shows you how nature works, how we interact with it, and how we have sustained--and can continue to sustain--our relationship with the earth by applying nature?s lessons to our economies and individual lifestyles. This central theme of sustainability--the ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions--is clarified by an emphasis on natural capital (resources) and degradation, solutions, trade-offs, and the importance of individuals. If you have little or no science background, the book provides you with a solid grounding in the basics that will help you better understand environmental science concepts. Case studies--on topics ranging from the importance of insects to the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone Park to the world of nanotechnology--illustrate key topics and issues that affect your life. These cases inspire How Would You Vote? questions, which sharpen your critical thinking by asking you to consider facts, conflicting solutions, and trade-offs surrounding the issues, and then cast your vote.  Multimedia resources offer other ways to learn. CengageNOW features Personalized Study Plans and interactive exercises and animations that help you master concepts. MP3 audio study tools can be included with your text at your instructor?s request, or can be purchased separately through www.iChapters.com. There?s an eBook too, which is available for purchase.",
