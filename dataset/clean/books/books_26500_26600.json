Today we are at the brink of discoveries that should soon reveal the deepest secrets of the universe.Alpha and Omega is a dispatch from the front lines of the cosmological revolution that is being waged at observatories and laboratories around the world-in Europe, in America, and even in Antarctica--where scientists are actually peering into both the cradle of the universe and its grave. Scientists--including galaxy hunters and microwave eavesdroppers, gravity theorists and atom smashers, all of whom are on the trail of dark matter, dark energy, and the growing inhabitants of the particle zoo-now know how the universe will end and are on the brink of understanding its beginning. Their findings will be among the greatest triumphs of science, even towering above the deciphering of the human genome. This is the book you need to help understand the frequent front-page headlines heralding dramatic cosmological discoveries. It makes cutting-edge science both crystal clear and wonderfully exciting.",

A succession of voices\u2014exiles, activists, separated lovers, the families of those victimized by political violence\u2014gives an account of ruptured safety. They bear witness to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of personal and social damage in the aftermath of terror.

Always an eloquent voice against the ravages of inhumanity, Dorfman\u2019s poems, like his acclaimed novels, continue to be a searing testimony of hope in the midst of despair.",

        "Authors": "By Steel, Danielle",
        "Description": "Wanderlust is the story of Audrey Driscoll.  Orphaned young, Audrey has grown up caring for her eccentric millionaire grandfather and her demanding younger sister, Annabelle, who assume she will always be there for them.  Sheltered yet restless, responsible beyond her years yet hungering for experience, Audrey is hopelessly bound until she herself makes the daring decision to leave.  As the 1930s unfold, alone, camera in hand, she will shock friends and outrage family as she plunges headlong into the wider world.Crossing the Atlantic aboard the luxurious Queen Mary, Audrey meets James and Violet Hawthorne, who will draw her into a sophisticated circle of artists and expatriates.  And it is they who will introduce her to Charles Parker-Scott, in who Audrey will come to recognize a twin soul, a man propelled by relentless curiosity and driven by conflicting needs for intimacy and independence.  Together they will spend an exquisite summer at Cap d'Antibes, then board the Orient Express on an adventure that will carry them to a remote outpost in China.  But at the farthest reaches of this journey Aubrey must choose again.  Japan has attacked China.  Charles knows he must return to Europe at once.  But Audrey becomes involved with a besieged orphanage and decides to remain in China without Charles, caring for the abandoned children until help arrives.  In time Audrey will return to America with a daughter of her own.  While she must come home to San Francisco to confront a world irrevocably changed by time, she finds she cannot stay.  From prewar Germany to London during the Blitz, from a wrenching reunion with Charles to a war zone in North Africa, again and again she must choose between the dictates of her conscience and the yearnings of her heart.  For Audrey Driscoll and the men and women whose lives touch hers, wanderlust is the inescapable element.  Born at a time when women were expected to stay close to home and fulfill traditional roles, Audrey is compelled to follow the thread of events that will destroy the complacency of the past and shape the future.  From Europe to China, from San Francisco to North Africa, she is irresistibly drawn into a man's world of conflict, discovery, and danger.  In a vivid novel of breathtaking scope, Danielle Steel has once again surpassed herself in creating an unforgettable tale of men and women caught in the tides of personal drama and historic event.  Wanderlust is Danielle Steel's finest journey.",

With unfailing aim and ever-present wit, he unflinchingly takes on liberalism's sacred cows - among them \"Slick Willie\" Clinton, Teddy \"The Swimmer\" Kennedy, wheelchair radicals, academia nuts, Columbus bashers, feminist emasculators, welfare swindlers, and third world \"governments.\" \"I don't mind if others call me a conservative, but I'm just me.\" In fact, Bob Grant has never been predictable - how many conservative icons have successfully raised the hackles of both fans and foes? Most of his listeners love him, many others love to hate him, but for all who tune in each afternoon to his heady and engaging mix of old-fashioned storytelling and withering social commentary, Bob Grant is more than anything else a supreme entertainer - and the tops in American talk radio.",

        "Description": "Much has changed in the past seventy-five years, and for that we owe no greater debt than to the publication of Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.'s life work, the first comprehensive social history of the United States ever undertaken, A History of American Life.Published in twelve volumes from 1927 to 1944, A History of American Life pushed the study of American history into places it had never been before, and legitimized a new discipline - social history - in its wake. Few series before or since have boasted more notable contributors, among them Pulitzer Prize winners James Truslow Adams and Allan Nevins, and Schlesinger himself, one of the most influential historians of the twentieth century.To this day, A History of American Life remains one of the most magnificent attempts ever made to comprehend the American experience in its totality, from the coming of the first explorers to the Great Depression. A work of astonishing narrative power, richly enjoyable in the broadest of its strokes and the most minute of its particulars, it offers a definitive answer to the question \"What is the American civilization?\" We celebrate its republication in a single volume, sensitively abridged by Mark C. Carnes, and including a lengthy introduction by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.'s son, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., and an extended historiographical essay by Professor Carnes.",

These were voyages for science, national prestige, and profit. Life was incredibly harsh: Crews had poor provisions and inadequate clothing and were constantly threatened by scurvy. Often they had to make their own charts as they sailed in the stormy waters of the Southern Ocean below the Convergence, that sea frontier marking the boundary between the freezing Antarctic waters and the warmer sub-Antarctic seas. These seamen were the first to discover and exploit a new continent, which was not the verdant southern land they imagined but an inhospitable expanse of rock and ice, ringed by pack ice and icebergs - Antarctica.",

        "Description": "Deep in the Vermont mountains is a small town, rustic and isolated, with cold, clear streams and dense, green forests. It's a place that Nell Maye remembers fondly, where her grandparents lived and where she spent summer vacations as a child. A place where not much happens. But when Nell and her husband Billy decide to leave the mess of their lives in NYC for this peaceful New England town, they realize that it's not exactly as they imagined. Under the placid surface is a place simmering with tension. There's Lenny, who's been entrusted with the care of her mute grandson Jody because his father has physically abused and abandoned him. There's Eli, a widower struggling to raise his wild son, just barely under his control. There's James, the high-school geology teacher, longing for someone to change his life, unaware that all the high-school girls secretly adore him. There's the pack of high school boys, bored and always looking to score some alcohol and cigarettes. Enter Nell, the dreamy, vaguely unhappy music teacher and Billy, her manic husband, who bring their city ways and their fears of the country along with a host of further complications for everyone around them. James falls for Nell, Billy scorns the townspeople; and a high school boy, stockpiling small resentments, decides to take revenge. When the dust settles, one man is dead, two boys are banished from town, a marriage has fallen apart, and-out of the ashes-a new romance begins. A COLD SPRING is a story of the roads we see and the ones we don't, and of those moments when lives suddenly change direction.",

        "Description": "Love and Infamy is a sweeping novel of history and destiny - and a love story of unforgettable proportions - about two men who know the secret of Pearl Harbor, only one of whom has the will to stop it....Tokyo, Honolulu. The approach of conflict in the Pacific. Two men - one American, one Japanese - raised as blood brothers, are faced with the crisis of their lives on the eve of World War II. Cotton Drake has left the States to follow in the footsteps of his missionary parents back in Japan. Kiyoshi Serikawa, a Japanese who at times seems more American than the Americans, stays behind in Hawaii, and is recruited by his nation to help plan \"Operation Z\" - the secret attack on Pearl Harbor. Soon history will force each man to choose between America and Japan - and each other.For when Cotton returns to Tokyo, he realizes there is a clandestine campaign in the making, and suspects that Kiyoshi knows more about it than he admits. And as Cotton grows surer of his best friend's treachery, he falls more deeply in love with the beautiful Miyuki. The daughter of a Japanese war hero and Kiyoshi's dutiful wife, she, too, will have to choose between passion and duty, love and country.Full of wartime intrigue, Love and Infamy vividly conveys the spirit of antebellum Japan. Combining the heart-stopping romance of James Michener's Tales of the South Pacific and the epic scope of James Jones's From Here to Eternity, Love and Infamy is the kind of rich, involving novel that fans of popular fiction and popular history will find irresistible.",
