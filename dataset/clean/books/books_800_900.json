Bubbles Ablaze finds the redoubtable Ms. Bubbles Yablonsky heeding a call from her boss at the News-Times and racing her Camaro toward a potentially big news story. But when she arrives at an abandoned coal mine, she finds the love of her life, Steve Stiletto, knocked unconscious . . . and the body of another man with a sizeable hole in his chest. Moments later, Bubbles and Stiletto are trapped by an explosion. Convinced that someone wants them dead, they search for their intended assassin in coal country, where they uncover a conspiracy at the Main Mane hairdressing salon, a cadre of women known as the Sirens of Slagville, and a hot spot called Limbo that's been burning underground for forty years.  With a cast of characters headed by the usual suspects-Bubbles's brainy teenage daughter Jane; Jane's clueless boyfriend G; and that dynamite duo, her mother LuLu and paranoid sidekick Genevieve- and led by the singular Bubbles herself, this is another fast and furious tale that will keep readers in Limbo-and in stitches.",

Or perhaps she did, and meant one day to say so herself. Whatever, The Third Sister is an imaginative, creative continuation of Sense and Sensibility, featuring a Margaret Dashwood, the third sister, once so underestimated, who turns out to fool even her creator.",

        "Description": "For Steve Keeney, it began with a simple favor. A woman from Keeney's Louisville church, Bobbie Roberts, confided that her twenty-year-old daughter Deana had recently died in a cliff fall at Big Sur, California. Bobbie was now having trouble collecting burial insurance. Keeney, a successful corporate lawyer, agreed to help her cut through the red tape.The coroner's report stated that a couple named B.J. and Virginia McGinnis had driven Deana to a four-hundred-foot Big Sur cliff. The McGinnises said that when their backs had been turned, the girl had fallen \"without a sound.\" Days after reading this report, Keeney was stunned to learn that Virginia had paid for a life insurance policy on Deana one day before the accident.Keeney suspected foul play, but Big Sur authorities quietly dropped the case: There were no witnesses other than the McGinnises. Undeterred, Keeney promised his client that he would try to find out the truth. A chilling portrait emerged.Virginia called herself a practical nurse, but people had dark memories of her \"care.\" They recalled her three-year-old daughter, her husband, and her mother - all of whom died while alone with Virginia. A series of fires, thefts, poisonings, and insurance policies ran through her past. Keeney also discovered that both of Virginia's sons had been charged with murder.As Keeney was piecing the facts together, he realized he had uncovered a remorseless killer, one who beat the system for twenty years, collecting insurance along the way.Former prosecutor David Heilbroner, author of the highly acclaimed book Rough Justice, spent two-and-a-half years retracing Keeney's investigation, preserving accounts of many witnesses whose voices were never heard at Virginia's extraordinary two-month murder trial - a trial that literally took the jury to the edge of the Big Sur cliff. In Death Benefit, he crafts a meticulous account of both a killer's life and a Kentucky lawyer's dedication to decency and courage triumphant over evil. Death Benefit belongs to that rare breed of books - a powerful human drama and a true-life courtroom thriller.",

        "Authors": "By Lehman, John",
        "Description": "Former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman here confronts one of the momentous issues of American history and the American present--the contending prerogatives of the president and Congress in making war.Lehman, a lively controversialist and scholar, examines the history of American military decision making from the Revolutionary period to the Gulf War. Whose power is it to declare war, to carry it out, and to sustain its course and bring it to an end? In addressing these major constitutional questions, Lehman is vibrantly contemporary, too, writing as a government insider to offer a exceptionally vivid perspective on Operation Desert Storm and recent military actions in Grenada, Libya, Lebanon, and Panama. Arguing vehemently for the primacy of presidential over congressional power, Lehman adds crucial new details to our understanding of the post-Vietnam era of American politics.Characteristically, Lehman pulls no punches. He sheds provocative new light on congressional investigations into Watergate and Iran-Contra, authoritatively demonstrating the ways in which Congress has created crippling impediments to presidential power. Yet he provides a fresh understanding of the essential role Congress must play in committing the nation to war, and he enumerates how presidents from Jefferson to Bush have interpreted--and misinterpreted--the powers grated them as commander in chief.John Lehman's enlightening new book makes a invaluable contribution as to whether responsible judgments will be made if and when the nation must again confront the crucial decision of making war.",

Many famous and brilliant writers have led withdrawn, prosaic, uneventful lives; but Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, existed almost wholly in the real, external world--active, social, sadly typical of that frantic time in which he experienced instant success and fame, followed by a long decline and failure. Arthur Mizener is well known as the author of the first full-scale biography of Fitzgerald. In this book, Professor Mizener looks at the facts of Fitzgerald's short life, offering insights into the subtle way in which actual events were transformed and woven into the novels. With the aid of contemporary photographs from all stages of Fitzgerald's career he tells the human story and provides an important assessment of Fitzgerald's achievement.",

        "Title": "Living With Cannibals And Other Womens Adventures",
        "Authors": "By Slung, Michele and Lindbergh, Reeve (INT)",
        "Description": "The spirit of adventure sweeps through the chapters of this exciting volume as we encounter the inspiring, sometimes tragic, often humorous tales of adventurous women -- from the 18th century to the 21st century.  Selected from National Geographic's rich archives, this colorful group portrait pairs female adventurers of the past with their contemporary counterparts -- in a \"then and now\" approach.  You'll meet Arctic explorers -- an American heiress who crisscrossed ice fields seven decades ago, along with a celebrated New Zealander who skied alone to both North and South Poles in the 1990s. You'll also join in the atmospheric exploits of Shannon Lucid and Amelia Earhart as they take off on those daring flights that wrote a new pages in the annals of aviation.  Tour the world with women who defied Victorian convention to venture alone among the headhunters of Borneo or to see first hand the hidden corners of Africa, India, and Japan. Witness world record-breaking moments by such latterday legends as Sylvia Earle, whose explorations of the ocean floor earned her the nickname, \"Her Royal Deepness,\" and Catherine Destivelle, the beautiful French superstar of modern mountaineering.  Featuring photographs, art, and period illustrations, as well as an introduction by Reeve Lindbergh and a 1,500-year time line of women's adventuring, Living With Cannibals offers vivid testimony to the wanderlust, daring, and determination of these intrepid journeyers.  Whether kayaking remote Tibetan rivers or bottle-feeding baby orangutans, bicycling to India or battling icebergs off the coast of Greenland, each woman profiled here demonstrates her unswerving devotion to a dream.",

        "Title": "A Time of Our Choosing: America's War in Iraq",
        "Authors": "By Purdum, Todd S.",
        "Description": "The authoritative account of America\u2019s most controversial war since Vietnam, a conflict in which \u201cshock and awe\u201d were not confined to the battlefield It was a war like no other the United States had ever fought. It began with the bombing of Saddam Hussein\u2019s bunker and ended with statues of the Iraqi dictator being toppled in downtown Baghdad, and it marked a turning point in America\u2019s relations with its enemies, its allies, and its sense of itself. Yet most Americans experienced the war as impressionistic and often confusing\u2014the story of one battle here, one unit there, a report from one city, then another, without the larger context we so urgently needed. Each reporter had his \u201cslice\u201d of the war, it seemed, but no one had the whole story or the broad view.A Time of Our Choosing fills that gap brilliantly, drawing on the unparalleled resources and reportage of The New York Times. Todd S. Purdum, one of the paper\u2019s most gifted storytellers, traces the war in Iraq from the first rumblings after 9/11, to the diplomatic recriminations at the United Nations, to the battles themselves and their aftermath. He deftly rolls out the whole canvas before our eyes, showing how the individual \u201cslices\u201d fit together into a single, gripping drama.Purdum also explores the complex legacy of America\u2019s near-unilateral action. Since the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush has vowed that the United States would confront its enemies \u201cat a time of our choosing,\u201d and Purdum shows in vivid terms what this choice has meant for our now transformed world.",

        "Title": "Rewriting History",
        "Authors": "By Morris, Dick and McGann, Eileen",
        "Description": "Now, for the first time, Fox News political analyst and former Clinton adviser Dick Morris turns his sharp-eyed gaze on Hillary, the longtime First Lady, current New York senator, and bestselling author. For, as he argues, no politician in America today is better aligned to become president in 2008\u2014and none would bring more baggage to the White House\u2014than Mrs. Clinton. In Rewriting History, Morris draws on his own long working relationship with the Clintons, as well as his trademark deep research and candid, nonpartisan analysis, to create a rebuttal to Hillary's bestselling autobiography, Living History. Morris documents how Hillary hides her true self behind a \"Hillary\" brand that is chatty, charming, giggly, and warm\u2014but is far from her true personality.In Rewriting History, Morris pierces the mask to get at the truth behind the distortions and omissions of Hillary's memoir. Here we meet the real Hillary, both good and bad: the manager who makes the trains run on time, but also the paranoid who sees all those who disagree with her as personal enemies; the idealist, but also the \"advice addict\" easily misled by the guru of the moment. Morris describes Hillary's sense of entitlement, and warns that it may lead deep into financial scandal. And he demonstrates how Hillary dodges criticism by pretending that every attack is directed not just at her, but at every working woman in America. Ultimately, Morris argues, the Hillary Clinton of today is marketing a false front, obscuring both her wants and her assets behind the phony facade of a domestic Everywoman. But as she pursues higher office, she also faces a choice. Will she, like Bobby Kennedy, see the error of her ruthless ways, and embrace the sincere idealism she professes? Or, like Richard Nixon, will she allow the darker angels of her nature to overcome her, jeopardizing herself and the country in the process?As Rewriting History suggests, we can only hope that Hillary Clinton's past performance is no guarantee of future results.",

        "Authors": "By Cooper, Sarah (EDT)",
        "Description": "In recent years, much attention has been lavished on the New Women of rap and rock. From rap stars such as Queen Latifah to bands such as Velocity Girls, popular music has been aggressively redefined by a new generation of women, with a startling range of musical styles. Yet, women's role in contemporary music, and in music history, extends far beyond MTV or the latest riot grrrl troupe. In Girls! Girls! Girls!, Sarah Cooper has assembled a broad- ranging collection of essays to provide an entertaining and impressionistic portrait of women and music. Whether in the form of Helen Kolawole's discussion of the bitch- bashing misogyny of gangsta rap or Caroline Sullivan's exuberant assessment of women rock critics, the volume raises, and addresses, some of the most provocative and challenging issues concerning women's active involvement in and relationship to music. From indie labels to opera queens, from symphony orchestra to salsa queen, from swing to women's music in South Asia to the confessions of a British country music fan, Girls! Girls! Girls! has something for everyone, music critics, feminists, and fans alike.",

No course was too grand, no driving range too humble for a stop on Hallberg's unpredictable tour of America's verdant and not-so-verdant golf venues. He tackled Kiawah Island's diabolical and breathtaking Ocean Course with a party of well-heeled Southern gents. He tromped through sagebrush roughs and kikuyu bunkers in the Nevada outback. He encountered the ghost of a cherished golfing buddy during a memorable round in the Smokies. And between games he nursed his wounds, pondered his constantly mutating handicap, and commiserated with fellow golfers in dusky sports bars, greasy spoons, and rain-soaked motel parking lots.The Soul of Golf will make you laugh out loud, swallow hard in the face of painful truths, and ultimately head yet again for your favorite golf course, where fate lies in ambush.",

These are some of the concerns expressed by twenty-six African American women in interviews with filmmaker-writer Courtney Long about what they wish for in African American men. And these issues are only part of the main concern shared by these women: that the gap between black men and women is widening into a chasm. The straight-talking sisters in Love Awaits discuss their brothers in the hope that they are taking the first step toward building a bridge of mutual understanding, unity, and peace - and creating a common ground for love and relationship.Arranged by topic, these interviews on love, sex, and growing up in the African American culture examine with honesty and raw energy the positive and negative aspects of relations between black women and men. They explore sources of pain and of healing between the sexes, obstacles to relating and new ways of being together. Candidly expressing her needs, desires, and expectations, each woman brings her own unique experiences, viewpoint, and personality to the discussion, weaving her own strand into the vibrant tapestry of the African American experience.",

To help orient the inevitable debates on this agenda, experts from Harvard's Center for Science and International Affairs here examine a set of key issues and problems that, taken together, define the scope and limits of such a policy.Among the topics discussed are the new relationship between federal and state governments implied by the administration's proposals, the usefulness of the concept of \"critical technologies\" for setting priorities, the creation of new missions for the national laboratories (particularly the three weapons laboratories), the changing nature of the social contract between the government and research universities, the problems that will confront the creation of a national information infrastruc\u00adture, the best ways to promote small- \u00adand medium-sized \"driver\" companies as well as civilian research and development generally, and the relationship between education and the requirements for work in the twenty-first century.Lewis M.

She seems to have fallen from the sky, like Sky Woman of the Oneida creation myth. When Anna and Emmett discover that Brenda was at the center of a bitter land dispute between Indians and white settlers who have lived on the land for many generations, they are sure she was murdered. Their investigation takes them to the edge of a simmering cauldron. Flag-waving whites are picketing the Turning Stone Casino and other Oneida-owned businesses. Indians are cruising with guns in their cars. Added to the dangers of race war is the presence of all the money-grubbing interests drawn to a lucrative casino. As their pool of suspects - of all colors - grows, Anna and Emmett's own lives depend on Anna's instincts, and her ability to see the line where myth and reality come together.",

        "Description": "The California Gold Rush captured the get-rich dreams of people around the world more completely than almost any event in American history. This catalog, published in celebration of the sesquicentennial of the 1848 discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill, shows the vitality of the arts in the Golden State during the latter nineteenth century and documents the dramatic impact of the Gold Rush on the American imagination.Among the throngs of gold-seekers in California were artists, many self-taught, others formally trained, and their arrival produced an outpouring of artistic works that provide insights into Gold Rush events, personages, and attitudes. The best-known painting of the Gold Rush era, C.C. Nahl's Sunday Morning in the Mines (1872), was created nearly two decades after gold fever had subsided. By then the Gold Rush's mythic qualities were well established, and new allegories\u2014particularly the American belief in the rewards of hard work and enterprise\u2014can be seen on Nahl's canvas. Other works added to the image of California as a destination for ambitious dreamers, an image that prevails to this day. In bringing together a range of art and archival material such as artists' diaries and contemporary newspaper articles, The Art of the Gold Rush broadens our understanding of American culture during a memorable period in the nation's history.",

Why, in spite of Lincoln's shortcomings, did the black leader Frederick Douglass think that the president's accomplishments were more remarkable than those of the founding fathers?  In providing at least partial answers to these questions, Lincoln and Slavery gives us a fresh look at a subject often shadowed by misinformation.  Here, we follow the young Lincoln as he takes an interest in the law and becomes a legislator. In a series of debates with his political opponent Stephen Douglas, we hear Lincoln argue forcefully that slavery, if allowed to spread, would destroy democracy.  As Lincoln and Slavery focuses on Lincoln's years as president, we see him work on the Emancipation Proclamation -- which changed the purpose of the Civil War and welcomed black men into military service. We go with him to Gettysburg, where he reaffirms \"the proposition that all men are created equal.\" We listen to him, only weeks before his death, as he proclaims that the Union armies will keep fighting \"until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid for by another drawn with the sword.\"  This is the story of a great American, a man who hated slavery and believed, above all else, that democracy was the best hope for humankind -- in his time and in all the years to come.",

Expanding upon her pathbreaking work in The Reproduction of Mothering and combining significant new writings with previously published essays, Nancy J. Chodorow elucidates how the unconscious awareness of self and gender we develop from earliest infancy continues to shape both our experience as men and women and the patterns of inequality and difference that exist throughout our society and culture.\u00a0\"Chodorow is an exceptionally intelligent and serious writer, and her contribution to the debate on gender and sexual identity is substantial. . . . Through her deepening reflections on gender issues and her study of the reality of women's lives, Ms. Chodorow puts both Freud and feminism to the test.\"\u2014Stuart Schneiderman, New York Times Book Review\u00a0\"In [a book] teeming with ideas, Chodorow . . . explores issues such as the influence of maternal care on the emerging self, social oppression of women on the basis of presumed gender differences, Oedipal conglict, heterosexual identification, and women analysts.\"\u2014Publishers Weekly\u00a0\"These essays are as good a statement of the issues in feminist psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic feminism as I have seen, reflecting the knowledge and questions of an 'insider' in both areas. One is impressed by the richness of the implications drawn from observed constellations or relationships. This is book that should be of interest to a wide audience.\"\u2014Malkah T. Notman, M.D., Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association\u00a0\"All readers will profit from reading all of the articles in historical sequence.

What does it mean to lead a good life? How binding is the marriage vow? What are your obligations to an employer? To your friends? To yourself? Is it always immoral to tell a lie? Eminent sociologist and public intellectual Alan Wolfe asked Americans around the country such questions in order to determine how we really think about morality today. Wolfe discovered that while values have changed, they are far from absent. Americans of all stripesfrom the most radical to the most traditionalwant to lead a good life, but in almost every case they are determined to decide for themselves what a good life means. Focusing on traditional virtues of loyalty, honesty, self-restraint, and forgiveness, Moral Freedom reveals the complexities of living in a society where rather than simply accepting strict conventions, each individual struggles to forge a moral life.",

Mac OS X Hacks goes beyond the peculiar mix of man pages and not-particularly-helpful Help Center, pulling the best tips, tricks, and tools from the Mac power users and Unix hackers themselves.The collection reflects the real-world know how and experience of those well steeped in Unix history and expertise, sharing their no-nonsense, sometimes quick-and-dirty solutions to administering and taking full advantage of everything a Unix desktop has to offer: Web, Mail, and FTP serving, security services, SSH, Perl and shell scripting, compiling, configuring, scheduling, networking, and hacking.  Add to that the experience of die-hard Macintosh users, customizing and modifying their hardware and software to meet their needs: System Preferences, GUI mods and tweaks, hardware tips, vital shareware and freeware, AppleScript, AppleTalk and equivalents, keyboard modifiers, and general Macintosh-style tomfoolery.Each Hack can be read easily in a few minutes, saving countless hours of searching for the right answer.  Mac OS X Hacks provides direct, hands-on solutions that can be applied to the challenges facing both those meeting the Mac for the first time and long-time users delving into Mac OS X and its Unix underpinnings.Mac OS X Hacks is the third in O'Reilly's new Hacks Serier which aims to begin reclaiming the term \"hacking\" for the good guys.  In recent years, the term has come to be associated with those nefarious black hats who break into computers to snoop, steal information or disrupt Internet traffic.  But the term originally had a more benign meaning, and you'll still hear it used this way whenever developers get together.  Our new Hacks books are written in the spirit of the true hackers -- the people who drive innovation.",

        "Authors": "By Friedman, Kinky",
        "Description": "Now, at last, it can be revealed! The TRUTH behind the legend!  That Kinky Friedman... Where did he come from? How did he get that way? Shouldn't someone have called 911 long ago?   Now, in Blast from the Past, nationally bestselling author Kinky Friedman has searched his failing memory and has come up with a novel about his early days in New York City and how Kinky Friedman, the down-and-out star-crossed country music performer, became Kinky Friedman, the down-and-out star-crossed ace detective.  In this prequel to his earlier novels, one which gives new meaning to the term \"retro,\" Kinkster fans are given the definitive answer to two of literature's great burning questions: Where the hell did those weird characters come from anyway? And what about that puppet head?  Of course, it's not just Kinky himself who gets retroed, but all the Village Irregulars as well -- Ratso, Rambam, and McGovern -- who are glimpsed in the nascent stage, as is the ever-luscious Stephanie DuPont, who blasts upon the scene as a five-year-old nymphet in patent-leather spikes.   Imagine it's the '70s. Imagine the Lone Star Cafe is still alive and well. Imagine that it's still okay to do drugs, still okay to have unprotected sex, still okay to paddle a brat and spank a monkey. And imagine you are there, in the '70s, at the Lone Star, sipping a brew with the Kinkster, a much younger, even kinkier Kinky -- uncouth, unshaped, unrepentant, and frequently unconscious.  But lest you think that Blast from the Past is all nostalgia, be assured that Kinky has supplied a bang-up plot as well, much of which revolves around the mystery of who this guy Tim is who Judy exclaims about while being hosed by Kinky, and the question of whether or not the Feds have found Abbie Hoffman, who has been playing hide-and-seek in Ratso's apartment. Or something like that.  As always, it's great, unpredictable fun from a true original, whose \"Irreverent, bawdy and often outrageous adventures are like no others,\" as says The San Diego Union-Tribune. In Blast from the Past, you'll find the Kinkster in top form and at his most outrageous.",

(Jack, of course, is attending Boston College, the Jesuits' hangout in Chestnut Hill.)He makes a big mistake: he invites her home to Chicago for the holiday, though it isn't even Christmas in the Russian Orthodox calendar, and gorgeous Odessa is never alone except when she wants to be. So? So she accepts! And what happens when she gets to Chicago, caught in the American maelstrom of commercialized Yuletide? Ah, now, that would be telling, wouldn't it? Enough to say, there's a tree, and a feast, and midnight Mass, and a gaggle of contentious Flanigans of all ages - who have the merriest Christmas ever - and nothing will ever again be quite the same for any of them.

        "Description": "Is it the war to end all wars - or war without end? What began as a conflict in Europe, when Germany unleashed a lightning assault on its enemies, soon spread to North America, as a long-simmering hatred between two independent nations explodes. Twice in fifty years the Confederate States of America has humiliated their northern neighbor. Now revenge may at last be at hand.Under the leadership of Teddy Roosevelt, and following a general named Custer - military genius or madman? - the United States are fighting a war on two fronts in 1917. In the north, from the Pacific to Quebec, U.S. forces in the air and on land are locked in battle against Canada and Great Britain. To the south, at the heart of a line that stretches from the Gulf of California to the Atlantic, Custer intends to do what none of his predecessors had ever managed: to smash through the Confederate barbwire entrenchments in Tennessee.Here are leather-jacketed daredevil pilots flying unproved fighters into anti-aircraft fire. Here is a melee on the sea, as U.S. sailors duel Confederate submariners, while the English, French, and Japanese surface navies vie for control of the shipping lanes. In Harry Turtledove's incredibly imagined alternate history, the Great War is played out over a cast of vivid characters. Amid the sound and fury of battle, as nonaligned nation-states choose sides and politicians spew bombast far from the front lines, The Great War: Breakthroughs captures a world war at an apocalyptic turning point. Victory is at hand - but at a price that may be worse than war itself.",
