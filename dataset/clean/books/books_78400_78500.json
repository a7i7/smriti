Through the single act of reading a book, a young student is uprooted from his old life and identity. Within days he has fallen in love with the luminous and elusive Janan; witnessed the attempted assassination of a rival suitor; and forsaken his family to travel aimlessly through a nocturnal landscape of traveler's cafes and apocalyptic bus wrecks. As imagined by Pamuk, the result is a wondrous marriage of the intellectual thriller and high romance.

The true story behind the song, \"Dixie,\" which was written in the North and was one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite songs. The Confederate veteran who erected a monument in New England to his former enemy, the soldiers of the Union army. The onetime Union drummer who apparently was the only Civil War veteran lost when the Titanic sank nearly five decades later. The Confederate veteran who wrote nearly 1,000 novels and novelettes after the Civil War and was buried at Jefferson Davis's postwar home in Mississippi. The Southern cemetery in which forty generals - all Union - are buried. An obscure Confederate general who is honored by a statue in Washington, D.C. How California won the Civil War for the Union...sort of...and how Texas gave the Confederacy a boost, even though Gov. Sam Houston did not intend to do so. The Union submarine that sank in a storm off Cape Hatteras while under tow to Charleston, South Caroline, not in battle.

        "Description": "\u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d Such a simple premise, yet how often do you see the Golden Rule violated in business settings? How often have you seen managers treat employees in ways they would never tolerate being treated themselves? And then you see these same managers complain about the commitment and productivity levels of today\u2019s workers.When translated to a philosophy of supervision, Golden Rule Management becomes \u201cIf at any time you are confused about any action to take with a person, always chose that action that results in trust, respect, and a higher self-image for the other person \u2026 the way you would wish to be treated.\u201d The results are astounding. When you treat workers with dignity and respect, as valued assets, and as the adults that they are, in return you get committed workers producing more with higher quality. For more than a decade, Stephen Holoviak has been helping companies implement Golden Rule Management. Success stories from these companies fill this book, bringing to life the myriad ways that Golden Rule Management can be applied. The book addresses, for example, how this philosophy fits in with performance-appraisal systems and career paths, how it can help you deal productively with unions, and how you can be a positive Golden Rule supervisor in a non-Golden Rule Management organization.Golden Rule Management gives first-line supervisors and middle managers practical advice for achieving success. The Golden Rule program is not a complex mathematical system that managers will not or cannot use. It is not \u201cfar out\u201d psychological jargon that readers will not understand. The Golden Rule process draws on points of reference that are readily identifiable. Its roots are traditional and familiar. Perhaps most importantly, it can be put to work immediately, with or without senior level management adopting it. With this book you can become a Golden Rule Manager today.",

In What's So Amazing About Grace?, award-winning author Philip Yancey explores grace at street level. If grace is God's love for the undeserving, he asks, then what does it look like in action? And if Christians are its sole dispensers, then how are we doing at lavishing grace on a cruel and pain-filled world? In fourteen sessions, this study guide will help you to interact deeply with Yancey's most personal and provocative book yet. If you're willing to leave your comfort zone to embrace a more vigorous, passionate Christianity -- read on. And prepare to grapple with grace and \"un-grace\" on a  personal level. You'll consider how you can contend graciously with today's tough moral issues. And you'll discover how you can become Christ's answer to a world that desperately wants to know, What's So Amazing About Grace?",

It is a thrilling story brimming with mystery, color, and historical lore. With great bravery and heart, two friends navigate a dark and treacherous medieval landscape rendered more perilous by the era's scheming, ambitious, even murderous men and women who will stop at nothing to possess the throne.",

        "Description": "Nancy Rhyne's first collection of stories, Tales of the South Carolina Low Country, was an award-winning book. Now she has given us another collection of fascinating tales, and like the first, it is a winner. Once again the author has mined the rich folklore of South Carolina. The twenty-two stories in this collection show the Low Country region as it was more than two hundred years ago and as it is today. Here you will find an assortment of strangely eerie but wonderfully entertaining stories. Some of the tales will have you laughing out loud. Others will make your spine tingle and your pulse race. Still others will guarantee that you leave your nightlight on after reading them. Look for the tragic story of the young girl who was buried alive on Edisto Island more than a century ago. Read about Clark Gable's visit to Hampton Plantation, where he witnessed scenes that were later incorporated into Gone With the Wind. And find out what happened to the talk-show host who allowed a pair of witches to put a spell on him. You will read these and the other nineteen stories with pleasure time after time.Nancy Rhyne has traveled all over the world and has collected coastal folklore on three continents, Greece, and the British Isles. But her first love is the South Carolina coast, and she has written dozens of articles and books about the area, its history, and its legends. While living in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, she taught a course on South Carolina folklore at Coastal Carolina College in Conway. She now lives in Ft. Myers, Florida.",
