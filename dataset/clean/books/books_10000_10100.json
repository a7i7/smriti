        "Authors": "By Beuchler, Rebecca (EDT)",
        "Description": "Nowadays, everyone who entertains is looking for outstanding casual fare that will allow them to spend more time with their guests. Dishes must be quick and easy to prepare (or able to be made ahead) and filled with the purest ingredients for optimum flavor. The Best of Gourmet, Featuring the Flavors of Thailand is filled with twenty-eight such menus-most are very relaxed, all are absolutely delicious.For example, after a chilly day on the slopes, you may want to treat your houseguests to A Ski House Dinner. Begin the evening around the fire with champagne and a large platter of ever-so-tender smoked salmon with cilantro cream. Later, roasted veal chops with shallots, tomatoes, and olive jus nestled on pillows of soft polenta make a rich, indulgent entr\u00e9e. And before everyone retires, a heavenly warm chocolate raspberry pudding cake, made the day before and reheated, is served with a glass of cognac. When the summer heats up, why not spend A Weekend at the Shore with friends? You'll have three clever menus in hand that take advantage of the season's abundant fresh produce, include plenty of make-ahead dishes, and satisfy hearty seaside appetites. On Saturday morning you can serve Breakfast on the Beach with buttery-rich baked blueberry-pecan French toast. Lunch Indoors includes a serve-yourself composed salad of classic favorites and a lovely rhubarb rice pudding. Then, after a long day in the sun, Dinner on the Deck promises a seafood meal to remember with curry-marinated mussels, followed by grilled lobster with Southeast Asian dipping sauce. Or perhaps a last-minute Beyond Backyard Basics dinner is closer to what you had in mind? This little gem of a menu features ratatouille with penne-a heavenly jumble of roasted eggplants, onions, yellow squash, and red bell peppers, with plum tomatoes, garlic, thyme, parsley, and basil. For dessert, multicolored grapes perched atop pastry cream in puff pastry shells make a scrumptious and ever-so-pretty choice.So which menu will you try first? You'll find more than eighty pages of exquisite full-color photographs to help you decide. Altogether, this volume holds more than 350 recipes-including the very best recipes that appeared in Gourmet's food columns during 1999. There are hundreds of dishes that can be made in forty-five minutes or less (look for the clock symbol \u00f0); plenty of leaner and lighter selections (look for the feather symbol F); seasonal ideas for everything from apples to zucchini; and an impressive array of tempting sweets and snacks.This year's Cuisines of the World section turns to the intriguing flavors of Thailand with a traditional dinner for eight and a collection of Thai snacks. Dishes such as steamed red snapper with ginger, grilled beef salad, fish cakes, and coconut ice cream demonstrate the sweet, sour, hot, and salty tastes of this fascinating country. Informative primers and exquisite full-color photos add further insight.Twenty-four more brand-new recipes appear in a special section featuring Unusual Pastas and Grains. From fresh rice noodles to Israeli couscous to wheat berries, and much more, these unique pantry items will undoubtedly expand your palette of flavors.Just when you thought you had tasted it all, along comes a cookbook that opens up a world of new possibilities-The Best of Gourmet",

        "Title": "Code-Name Bright Light : The Untold Story of U.S. POW Rescue Efforts During the Vietnam War",
        "Authors": "By Veith, George J.",
        "Description": "Code-Name Bright Light tells one of the great unknown stories of the Vietnam War: the American military's extensive secret operations to locate and rescue POW/MIAs during the conflict. It is a tale of tragedy and heroism revealed in full for the first time in this volume.  The history of the U.S. POW/MIA intelligence and wartime rescue operations has long remained concealed under the shroud of national security, unknown both to the public and to the families of the missing. George J. Veith has assembled an extensive range of previously unseen material, including recently declassified NSA intercepts, State Department cables, and wartime interrogation reports which reveal how the U.S. military conducted a centralized effort to identify, locate, and rescue its POW/MIAs.  Code-Name Bright Light also traces the development of the various national wartime POW intelligence operations and provides an in-depth look at the activities of the Joint Personnel Recovery Center, a secretive and highly classified POW/MIA unit in South Vietnam responsible for rescuing captives. Further, it uncovers one of the most tightly held POW/MIA secrets, the primary reason why the government did not think any Americans were left behind: a clandestine communication program between the POWs and the U.S. military. This still-sensitive program provided the identities and locations of American prisoners, defeating North Vietnamese efforts to keep their names and locations a secret.  The raids and efforts that make up the narrative of Code-Name Bright Light succeeded in freeing hundreds of captive South Vietnamese soldiers but resulted in the rescue of few Americans. The vast network of efforts, however, is a testament to the U.S. military's unknown commitment to freeing its captive soldiers. Veith concludes that the United States secretly went as far as any army could go in freeing its captives in this type of wartime situation. Our understanding of the war remains incomplete without this powerful history.",

She could leave ... but she would always have to come back, drawn like a magnet by the song of crystal that pulsed through her veins. Crystal singing brought ecstasy and pain, near-eternal life ... and an increasing loss of memory that bit by bit would erase the parts of that long, long life that lay behind her.Over the years, Killashandra had accumulated a multitude of painful memories she could easily afford to forget. She didn't even really mind the little annoyances, like forgetting the names and faces of her colleagues, or needing a locator to find her way back to her own apartment. But she hadn't counted on the loneliness and emptiness a person could feel when the heart could still remember what the mind had forgotten ...Fortunately for Killashandra, someone still cared enough to try to salvage what was left of her memory and her talents. And for the first time it had become possible to access the damaged minds of experienced crystal singers. But in order to avail herself of the new technique, Killashandra would have to learn to open herself up ... to another person, and to all the unpleasant memories she had so willingly relinquished.Killashandra Ree was trapped in the unceasing present of the crystal singer. Only by reclaiming her past could she step forward into the future. Crystal had destroyed her memory ... and only crystal could restore it ... if she dared!",

That book was Sex and the Single Girl and its author, Helen Gurley Brown, hasn't stopped communicating - intimately - with millions of women ever since through her other best-selling books and as editor in chief of Cosmopolitan.Following Sex and the Single Girl's phenomenal success, it was only a short time before Ms. Brown, with no previous magazine experience, turned the then-ailing and aging (one hundred years old) Cosmopolitan into the premiere women's magazine in America (number six among all magazines in newsstand sales) and the number-one young women's magazine in the world (twenty-eight international editions), each edited for and in celebration of Ms. Brown's creation, That Cosmopolitan Girl, the woman who loves men and children but doesn't want to live through other people; she wants to achieve on her own.In The Late Show: A Semiwild but Practical Survival Plan for Women over 50, Ms. Brown describes in her distinctive voice what it's like to grow old - NOT gracefully but resourcefully and energetically, what you can expect during the process and what you can do to make it rewarding.The book is divided into twelve informative chapters that range from emotional security, marriage, money, sex, beauty and clothes to food, exercise, health, doctors, work and the importance of each as one grows older. Ms. Brown shares her own knowledge along with extensive research.Various chapters contain nearly noncaloric (but satisfying) recipes; up-to-the-minute news on fiber, alcohol, vitamins and their impact on health; beauty tips from Raquel Welch, Ali MacGraw, Lauren Hutton, Joan Rivers, Diane von Furstenberg, Judith Krantz, Gloria Vanderbilt and many other great-looking women not still in their twenties or thirties. (Don't ever tease your hair. Use warm teabags for puffy eyes. Whole-egg mayonnaise will shine up dull hair. Fall in love, as often as you can get your hands on a love' object. Never give in to the idea that aging is the pits!)Ms. Brown talks freely about the joys and sorrows of her own life, shares her medical experiences (CAT scan, shingles, hysterectomy, cosmetic surgery). She acknowledges it would be pleasant to eschew diet and exercise (haven't we earned the right to relax and enjoy life?) but says that decision would be unthinkable for a woman who wants to stay \"young\" and beautiful. She offers sensible, palatable ways to stay trim and eat sumptuously. A noted surgeon answers questions about cosmetic surgery. Ms. Brown extols the joy of sex at any age, strongly suggests you keep it in your life, tells how to find it again if it's gone and enhance whatever is left.The Late Show is crammed with practical, innovative advice and insights from a life lived to the hilt - sensually, healthfully, successfully and presented in the same clear voice that is Ms. Brown's and Cosmo's signature.The Late Show can help any woman face this time of her life with verve, clout and self-reliance - sans depression - even if there's not a man around. If the best is not \"still to come,\" at least what's here this minute can be made terrific through application of the wisdom of this book.",

Nearly speechless for a time, I was beset by terrors.\u201dThis is the voice of Mary Jemison, who, in 1758, at the age of sixteen, was taken by a Shawnee raiding party from her home near what would become Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. In this intimate reimagining of her life story, Mary endures the brutal scalpings of her parents and siblings and is given to two Seneca sisters who treat her as their own\u2014a symbolic replacement for the brother they lost to the white colonists. Renamed Two-Falling-Voices, she gradually becomes integrated into her new family, learning to assist with the hunt and to cultivate corn. She marries a Delaware warrior, raises a family in her adoptive culture, becomes friends with two former slaves, and eventually, remarkably, fulfills her lifelong dream \u201cto own land bordered by sky, as my mother and father had once purchased woods and fields which were dappled with changing light.\u201dA testament to the resilience of the human mind and spirit, The White is a cut-crystal narrative of Mary\u2019s life among the Seneca, lit by flashes of her own voice and revealing her curious, open heart. From the novel\u2019s bloody opening to its arresting conclusion\u2014by her own choice Mary does not return to white society\u2014Deborah Larsen never flinches from the violence and the splendor that marked the settling of the New World.",

She has been nominated three times for the ABBY award, and her critically acclaimed writings consistently enjoy spectacular commercial success as they entertain and touch her legions of loyal fans.  In High Tide in Tucson, she returnsto her familiar themes of family, community, the common good and the natural world. The title essay considers Buster, a hermit crab that accidentally stows away on Kingsolver&#39;s return trip from the Bahamas to her desert home, and turns out to have manic-depressive tendencies. Buster is running around for all he&#39;s worth -- one can only presume it&#39;s high tide in Tucson. Kingsolver brings a moral vision and refreshing sense of humor to subjects ranging from modern motherhood to the history of private property to the suspended citizenship of human beings in the Animal Kingdom.  Beautifully packaged, with original illustrations by well-known illustrator Paul Mirocha, these wise lessons on the urgent business of being alive make it a perfect gift for Kingsolver&#39;s many fans.",

        "Description": "For centuries scientists have labored to identify and reverse the cause of aging, and now that effort has converged on one gland, one hormone, and one laboratory. The gland is the pineal, our body's natural timekeeper. The hormone is melatonin, the pineal's messenger. The laboratory is headed by one of the authors of this book. Drs. Pierpaoli and Regelson are the scientists credited with discovering the biological clock of aging, and now they explain to readers how to reset their biological clocks in order to live longer, healthier lives.The authors explain clearly, simply, and persuasively how melatonin works, how to use it, and what to expect when you do. In addition to their own internationally acclaimed work with melatonin and age-reversal, the authors address other important research currently under way around the world, including work that suggests melatonin is a safe, nonaddictive sleeping agent, can cure jet lag, boosts the immune system, increases our resistance to cancer and other diseases, lowers cholesterol, and can help relieve stress.",

        "Description": "Surrendering at Yorktown, the fifers for the beaten British Army played \"The World Turned Upside Down.\" It was an appropriate tune - in seven years of war, the Americans could barely claim even three military victories of any consequence. But the British could no longer sustain their efforts. They had more urgent battles to fight in Europe and they had no more money and lives to spend quelling a rebellion that, thanks to blunder after blunder, they could never quite finish off.But history is written by the winners, and in the two hundred years since the Revolution, a web of myth and legend has grown up around the struggle, glorifying it beyond recognition.John Tebbel set out to get as close as possible to the truth about how this country was born and what its people were like on both sides. He helps the reader discover why the Revolution was by far the most unpopular war this nation ever fought, and in some ways the most savage.From this perspective, the Revolution turns out to be like other wars - not a glorious, high-minded struggle, but one (for both sides) in which initial enthusiasm quickly fades, the gap between soldiers and citizens widens, and the distance between illusion and reality becomes ever greater. Yet the Revolution produced authentic heroes and a cast of other characters that would dwarf any Hollywood extravaganza for sheer variety, if nothing more.The War for Independence was a unique event in our history, one that deserves to be understood much better if we are to understand ourselves as a people and a nation.",

        "Authors": "By Petzinger, Thomas",
        "Description": "The New Pioneers is about a powerful revolution that is reshaping the face of American business and creating an opportunity-rich economy. It is not to be found in the headline-grabbing megamergers, takeovers, downsizing, fiscal crises, or bustups that command the front pages of the financial press. The vanguards of change are most visible not in the penthouse suites of the Fortune 500 but in spectacularly successful small- and medium-size firms.  With the compelling storytelling and keen insight that rank him among America's best-read business columnists, Tom Petzinger takes you inside this revolution to reveal how a dynamic generation of innovators and entrepreneurs is creating a collaborative new work-place, a value-added marketplace, and an economy over-flowing with opportunity. These new pioneers recognize that the command-and-control hierarchy of the twentieth century is no longer responsive to the economic forces sweeping the globe.  With the big-picture perspectives that have made his weekly Wall Street Journal column, \"The Front Lines,\" famous, Petzinger draws from corporate case studies of companies in more than forty cities in thirty states, as well as accounts from overseas. His startling conclusions reveal not only a changing of the guard but far-reaching changes in the way business is being conducted.  Among the highlights:  * How technology is wiping out economies of scale while creating economies of scope and locality  * How today's entrepreneurs are redefining the meaning of \"niche\"  * The creation of radical new compensation and motivation strategies for a new kind of workforce  * What business is learning from complexity science in the search for fundamental laws governing natural and human systems  * How the family firm can serve as a model for all business  * Why the new ethos sweeping business signals a return to fundamental human values  Petzinger's brilliant blending of microscopic reporting and \"macroscopic\" insight promises to make this book a modern classic.",

From a turn-of-the-century thirteen-year-old with a schoolgirl crush on a teacher to an elderly nineteenth-century Quaker at the end of her life, each of these women strikes a chord of sympathy and understanding in us, for their concerns are, after all, very like our own.",

        "Description": "When surgeons removed Dave Dravecky's left arm in 1991, cancer took more from him than just a limb. It also stripped him of his career as star pitcher for the San Francisco Giants, together with the sense of identity and worth he derived from it. Moreover, it propelled Dave on a journey he would have chosen not to take - a grueling search for answers to questions every man must face: What gives a man identity and value? Does his worth hinge on his performance? His family? His career? Does his value disappear when he can't produce? Or is a man's merit deeper than what he has and does?The Worth of a Man is a penetrating look at what defines the true value of men. Turning to the Bible, Dave Dravecky uncovers foundations of manhood that can't be shaken by adversity and loss. He offers a candid, highly practical perspective on the things that matter most to men: their occupations, friendships, families, successes and setbacks, the way they communicate, and the values they hold.Peeling back shallow, performance-based definitions of masculinity, The Worth of a Man probes the fractured parts of men's personalities - their failures, weaknesses, fears, and pain - then offers a new definition of worth for men based on the life of Christ inside them. Dravecky points to a deeply founded masculine identity that will withstand gain and loss, success and failure alike. It is an identity strong enough to be vulnerable and vital enough to inspire men to their highest potential in their marriages, friendships, and life pursuits.",
