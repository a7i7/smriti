        "Description": "The kitchen isn't just for cooking anymore, and homeowners are spending a lot of time and money to make it the true heart of their home. Older houses lack the open floor plan that allows the kitchen to become part of the living area, while an increasing number of amateur chefs are going beyond the basics to build a kitchen that's worthy of an upscale restaurant. The kitchen has become less utilitarian and more creative--a place where homeowners express their personal style as much as they would in any other room of the house. By that same token, new appliance technology allows for a more useful kitchen, while hiding the pragmatism behind aesthetics--no more avocado and harvest gold refrigeration giants. With all these new possibilities come an overwhelming array of choices and a substantial investment of time and money. Homeowners need guidance, and \"New Kitchen Idea Book\" will help them discover what they really want and how to achieve it. \"\"New Kitchen Idea Book\" provides inspiration for refreshing your kitchen for more enjoyment in both cooking and entertaining.\" --Chuck Williams, founder of Williams-Sonoma",

Lobdell became a born-again Christian in his late 20s when personal problems\u2014including a failed marriage\u2014drove him to his knees in prayer. As a newly minted evangelical, Lobdell\u2014a veteran journalist\u2014noticed that religion wasn't covered well in the mainstream media, and he prayed for the Lord to put him on the religion beat at a major newspaper. In 1998, his prayers were answered when the Los Angeles Times asked him to write about faith. Yet what happened over the next eight years was a roller-coaster of inspiration, confusion, doubt, and soul-searching as his reporting and experiences slowly chipped away at his faith. While reporting on hundreds of stories, he witnessed a disturbing gap between the tenets of various religions and the behaviors of the faithful and their leaders. He investigated religious institutions that acted less ethically than corrupt Wall St. firms. He found few differences between the morals of Christians and atheists. As this evidence piled up, he started to fear that God didn't exist. He explored every doubt, every question\u2014until, finally, his faith collapsed. After the paper agreed to reassign him, he wrote a personal essay in the summer of 2007 that became an international sensation for its honest exploration of doubt.Losing My Religion is a book about life's deepest questions that speaks to everyone: Lobdell understands the longings and satisfactions of the faithful, as well as the unrelenting power of doubt. How he faced that power, and wrestled with it, is must reading for people of faith and nonbelievers alike.",

Having spent the decades since Lincoln's death as an obscure shipping clerk, Surratt is approached by D.W. Griffith to read from his Civil War diary in Griffith's movie Birth of a Nation. As Surratt begins to read over his diary, the reader is cast back to the tumultuous days of 1864, and a chance encounter between Surratt and Booth. Booth, whose appetites, fame, and sheer force of will bedazzle everyone around him, helps to secure Surratt a position as the assistant to renowned photographer Alexander Gardner. Over the following weeks, Booth continues to lavish attention on Surratt, slowly drawing him into his web of intrigue. By the time Surratt discovers the desperate nature of Booth's true intentions, it is too late, and he finds himself caught up in a firestorm of violence that shatters forever his insulated life and modest ambitions.Based on the historical record, and illustrated with actual photographs of the conspirators and their execution, the novel is filled with nitty-gritty detail of nineteenth-century architecture, photography, Union troop movements, and day-to-day bustle that brings Washington during the Civil war vividly to life.",

        "Description": "If you drive anywhere in the snow belt, you probably know the feeling: rear wheels fish-tailing, steering useless, brakes ineffective -- you&apos;re out of control. The good news is, life doesn&apos;t have to be like a car on ice. Bill Hybels offers biblical insights and practical steps to securing a Christ-centered life that will get you where you want to go. Getting a Grip guides you toward wise choices and disciplined action in five vital areas of your life: you time, your health, your finances, your spiritual life, and your relationships. As you learn what the Bible has to say about each of these, you&apos;ll discover how able and eager Jesus is to help you obtain solid traction on the road of life. Interactions - a powerful, challenging tool for adult small group members to build deep relationships with one another and with God. Interactions is far more than a group Bible study. It\u2019s a cutting-edge series from Willow Creek, designed to help participants develop into fully devoted followers of Christ.  Interactions takes group members into the nitty-gritty issues of authentic Christian living. This latest wave of books helps participants ground themselves firmly in the basics of Christianity, cultivate their spiritual gifts, contend victoriously with life\u2019s tough issues, and get a grip on faith that can weed out the sin and inconsistencies in their lives.  Each book presents six thought-provoking sessions enhanced by icons, sidebars, quotes, and questions created specifically to build on the dynamics and interplay of small groups. All in a modern, two-color design that\u2019s attractive to look at and easy and effective to use.  Previous titles in this best-selling series include: Community, Parenthood, Lessons on Love, The Real You, Marriage, Evangelism, Commitment, Authenticity, Transformation, Fruit of the Spirit, Jesus, Psalms, Freedom, Character, Transparency, and Prayer.",

Uncompromising vision, a willingness to take risks, and exceptional business acumen.

Theirs are just a few of the stories collected in this anthology of commercial ingenuity.
