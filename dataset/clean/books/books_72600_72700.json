Now, with Homer & Langley, this master novelist has once again created an unforgettable work.Homer and Langley Collyer are brothers\u2013the one blind and deeply intuitive, the other damaged into madness, or perhaps greatness, by mustard gas in the Great War. They live as recluses in their once grand Fifth Avenue mansion, scavenging the city streets for things they think they can use, hoarding the daily newspapers as research for Langley\u2019s proposed dateless newspaper whose reportage will be as prophecy. Yet the epic events of the century play out in the lives of the two brothers\u2013wars, political movements, technological advances\u2013and even though they want nothing more than to shut out the world, history seems to pass through their cluttered house in the persons of immigrants, prostitutes, society women, government agents, gangsters, jazz musicians . . . and their housebound lives are fraught with odyssean peril as they struggle to survive and create meaning for themselves. Brilliantly conceived, gorgeously written, this mesmerizing narrative, a free imaginative rendering of the lives of New York\u2019s fabled Collyer brothers, is a family story with the resonance of myth, an astonishing masterwork unlike any that have come before from this great writer.",

        "Title": "Who Speaks For Islam?: What a Billion Muslims Really Think",
        "Authors": "By Esposito, John L. and Mogahed, Dalia",
        "Description": "Based on the largest study of its kind, this book is the first to present the fascinating findings of the Gallup Poll of the Muslim World.The horrific events of 9/11 dramatically intensified what many saw as an ongoing conflict between the U.S. and parts of the Muslim world. Extremism has grown exponentially as Muslims and non-Muslims alike continue to be victims of global terrorism. Terrorist attacks have occurred from Morocco to Indonesia and from Madrid to London, as U.S.-led wars rage in Iraq and Afghanistan. As of this writing, war and terrorism have already claimed more than 300,000 lives since 9/11; the vast majority have been civilians. As we face savage actions in a world that seems ever more dangerous and out of control, we are confronted daily by analysis from terrorism experts and pundits who see the religion of Islam as responsible for global terrorism. At the same time, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda beam messages throughout the world that demonize the West as the enemy of Islam, responsible for all the ills of the Muslim world. Amid the rhetoric of hate and growing violence, both anti-Americanism in the Muslim world and Islamophobia \u2014 discrimination against or hostility toward Islam or Muslims \u2014 have increased precipitously. In the aftermath of 9/11, President George W. Bush emphasized that America was waging war against global terrorism, not against Islam. However, the continued acts of a terrorist minority, coupled with statements by preachers of hate (Muslim and Christian) as well as anti-Muslim talk show hosts and political commentators have inflamed our emotions and distorted our views. The religion of Islam and the mainstream Muslim majority have been conflated with the beliefs and actions of an extremist minority. The result was reflected in a USA Today/Gallup poll, which found substantial minorities of Americans admitting to negative feelings or prejudice against Muslims and favoring heightened security measures with Muslims to help prevent terrorism. Nearly one-quarter of Americans, 22%, say they would not want a Muslim as a neighbor; fewer than half believe U.S. Muslims are loyal to the United States; and 44% say Muslims are too extreme in their religious beliefs. Are the growing violence and negative perceptions on all sides only a prelude to an inevitable all-out war between the West and 1.3 billion Muslims? The vital missing piece among the many voices weighing in on this question is the actual views of Muslim publics. With all that is at stake for U.S. and Muslim societies, indeed for the future of the world, the time has come to democratize the debate. Who Speaks for Islam? Listening to the Voices of a Billion Muslims is about this silenced majority. It is the product of a mammoth Gallup research study over the last six years. Gallup conducted tens of thousands of face-to-face interviews with residents of more than 35 predominantly Muslim nations. Gallup\u2019s sample represents urban and rural, young and old, educated and illiterate, women and men. In total, we surveyed a sample representing over 90% of the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Muslims, including Muslims in the West, making this the largest, most comprehensive study of contemporary Muslims ever. The concept of this book is simple. After collecting vast amounts of data representing the views of the world\u2019s Muslims, we asked the questions everyone wants answers to: What is at the root of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world? Who are the extremists? Is democracy a desired construct among Muslims, and if so, what might it look like? What do Muslim women really want? With questions in hand, we let the empirical evidence \u2014 the voices of a billion Muslims, not individual \u201cexperts\u201d or \u201cextremists,\u201d dictate the answer.",

As God's people, both Jew and Gentile, make themselves ready as his warrior bride, Christians will face increasing spiritual warfare that intersects with warfare in the natural realm. Sandra Teplinsky calls Jewish believers to stand firm in these times of intensified opposition and make themselves ready as the bride of Christ. Israel's Anointing encourages believers to take up the biblical mandate to make Israel jealous, to help God's chosen people see this company of militant lovers in whose midst Yeshua dwells--and want him at last. Anyone with a love for Israel and an eye toward the end times will connect with this powerful book.",

        "Authors": "By Carpenter, Ted Galen",
        "Description": "Noting a remarkable record of belligerence in recent US history, Carpenter (defense and foreign policy studies, Cato Institute) argues that American foreign policy is beset by three major problems: an unwillingness to terminate or reconsider the security obligations build up during the Cold War, a casual extension of security commitments to new client states that are even less relevant than the traditional Cold War-era allies to American security needs, and an increased willingness to intervene militarily in murky and often internecine conflicts. This demonstrates to Carpenter that the US foreign policy elite is unable to either establish proper priorities or to develop an analytical framework for assessing strategic choices. He applies this perspective to a number of significant foreign policy issues, including the Iraq debacle; the \"War on Terror;\" threatened war against Iran; broader Middle East regional issues; policy towards the Koreas; Taiwan policy; the relationship with China; NATO, the Balkans, and relations with Russia; the \"War on Drugs;\" and the relationship between foreign policy and domestic liberty.

Until a mysterious man at the restaurant leaves her a 2.5 million-dollar tip, and her life as she knew it is transformed.   At first its amazing: a hot new car, enormous flat-screen TV, and presents for everyone she cares about. She laughs off the warnings that money changes people, that they come to rely on what they have instead of who they are. Because it won't happen...not to her. Or will it? What do you do when you can buy anything your heart desires -- but what your heart desires can't be bought?   This is the story of a girl who gets rich, gets lost, and ultimately finds her way back - if not to where she started, then to where she can start again.",

Once the territory of skilled trade professionals, tile can now be installed with using modern thin-set adhesives, backer boards, and cutting tools that are easily usable by do-it-yourselfers of modest abilities. The Complete Guide to Ceramic & Stone Tile shows how to use these time-saving techniques and materials in virtually any tile application a homeowner is likely to encounter, both indoors and outdoors.Though installing ceramic tile can still be time consuming, it is no longer particularly difficult, which makes it an ideal project for do-it-yourselfers. Homeowners can save hundreds-or even thousands-of dollars by doing the work themselves. In addition to its practical benefit, ceramic and stone tile lends itself to creative expression. A routine countertop installation these days can become an exciting and unique design statement by including custom hand-painted tiles, which are now commonly available at specialty tile stores. Readers of this book will not only master the basics of tile installation, they will discover hundreds of purely decorative ways to use ceramic tile around the house.The Complete Guide to Ceramic & Stone Tile begins by teaching readers how to design a custom interior using tile, then presents in-depth, step-by-step information on all types of tile installation, including floors, walls, patios, countertops, backsplashes, and shower stalls. The book even includes decorative mosaic treatments that can be used to create ornamental tabletops, coffeetables, and garden planters. Learn how to work with all types of tile in addition to ceramic, including quarry tile, terra cotta, and natural stone.",

        "Description": "In 250 glorious photographs Wide Angle: National Geographic Greatest Places showcases every part of the world.  Delving deeply into our century-old picture archive, our new book-the third in the \"greatest photographs\" series-presents the world's hugely diverse places with epic grandeur, unparalleled intimacy, romantic beauty, and gritty realism.  The photographs are landscapes, cityscapes, famous landmarks, and unfamiliar spots that reveal special qualities of geography or culture we might otherwise never see.National Geographic's quest since its founding in 1888 has been to describe \"the world and all that's in it.\"  To fulfill that quest, photographers set out to document every imaginable place on earth, from the most remote to the most familiar; from the most primitive to the most sophisticated. National Geographic photographers have recorded the world's places close up, in sweeping breadth, in depth, and over time. Wide Angle is divided into twelve chapters, each depicting a unique geography (see list below) and the culture and nature that inhabit it. Chapters are introduced by short, 1,500-word essays. The book's length-504 pages-allows us to develop each chapter to look carefully and deeply at a region's special qualities. The geography and the life within it comes forward with its own unique character, its own special and unforgettable sense of place.\"EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA\"OCEANIA\"CENTRAL AND SOUTH ASIA\"MIDDLE EAST\"NORTHERN EUROPE\"CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE\"WESTERN AND SOUTHERN EUROPE\"NORTH AFRICA\"SUB-SAHARA AFRICA\"NORTH AMERICA\"THE CARIBBEAN, MESO- AND SOUTH AMERICA\"POLAR REGIONS",

        "Title": "The Touch: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By McCullough, Colleen",
        "Description": "Not since The Thorn Birds has Colleen McCullough written a novel of such broad appeal about a family and the Australian experience as The Touch.  At its center is Alexander Kinross, remembered as a young man in his native Scotland only as a shiftless boilermaker's apprentice and a godless rebel. But when, years later, he writes from Australia to summon his bride, his Scottish relatives quickly realize that he has made a fortune in the gold fields and is now a man to be reckoned with.  Arriving in Sydney after a difficult voyage, the sixteen-year-old Elizabeth Drummond meets her husband-to-be and discovers to her dismay that he frightens and repels her. Offered no choice, she marries him and is whisked at once across a wild, uninhabited countryside to Alexander's own town, named Kinross after himself. In the crags above it lies the world's richest gold mine.  Isolated in Alexander's great house, with no company save Chinese servants, Elizabeth finds that the intimacies of marriage do not prompt her husband to enlighten her about his past life -- or even his present one. She has no idea that he still has a mistress, the sensual, tough, outspoken Ruby Costevan, whom Alexander has established in his town, nor that he has also made Ruby a partner in his company, rapidly expanding its interests far beyond gold. Ruby has a son, Lee, whose father is the head of the beleaguered Chinese community; the boy becomes dear to Alexander, who fosters his education as a gentleman.  Captured by the very different natures of Elizabeth and Ruby, Alexander resolves to have both of them. Why should he not? He has the fabled \"Midas Touch\" -- a combination of curiosity, boldness and intelligence that he applies to every situation, and which fails him only when it comes to these two women.  Although Ruby loves Alexander desperately, Elizabeth does not. Elizabeth bears him two daughters: the brilliant Nell, so much like her father; and the beautiful, haunting Anna, who is to present her father with a torment out of which for once he cannot buy his way. Thwarted in his desire for a son, Alexander turns to Ruby's boy as a possible heir to his empire, unaware that by keeping Lee with him, he is courting disaster.  The stories of the lives of Alexander, Elizabeth and Ruby are intermingled with those of a rich cast of characters, and, after many twists and turns, come to a stunning and shocking climax. Like The Thorn Birds, Colleen McCullough's new novel is at once a love story and a family saga, replete with tragedy, pathos, history and passion. As few other novelists can, she conveys a sense of place: the desperate need of her characters, men and women, rootless in a strange land, to create new beginnings.",

He juxtaposes genuine works and fakes, enabling the reader to judge both quality and authenticity. In extensively illustrated sequences, he presents each style and explores regional difference. Finally, he moves to the American Arts and Crafts movement, and ends with a look at how earlier styles were revived and adapted in the 1930s and 1940s.

        "Title": "The Complete Earth",
        "Authors": "By Palmer, Douglas",
        "Description": "Reproducing one of the most advanced satellite surveys of Earth in its entirety, The Complete Earth explores our planet, explaining the how and when of its mountain ranges, deserts, ice-sheets, volcanoes and oceans.From pole to pole. The Complete Earth presents one of the most advanced portraits of our planet ever created Within these pages, data from NASA's most advanced Earth observing satellites has been combined to produce a cloud-free, digital atlas of the entire planet-a mappamundi for the Information Age.At a scale of 53 kilometres to every centimetre (93 miles to an inch), we can trace the Amazon from Andean headwaters to Atlantic mouth, explore the trackless sand seas of the Sahara, and follow the corrugated ridges of hills and mountains that mark the front-line of India's continental collision with Eurasia. We can track the ebb and flow of seasons across the globe, watching snows fall in the North as they melt in the South and desert lands bloom and fade as rains come and go.Combining NASA's digital portrait of the planet with high resolution satellite imagery that zooms in on noteworthy features-from volcanoes to asteroid craters, river deltas to glaciers-The Complete Earth creates an unprecedented view of our planet's face. Social and political boundaries are invisible and irrelevant, what we see instead is the landscape of the whole Earth - the mountains and deserts, seas and oceans that have shaped human history. Yet this configuration of rock and water represents a fleeting geological moment, having existed for no more than 4 million years-a mere 0.01 percent of the planet's lifetime. But look closer and a deeper past emerges. Earth's 4.5 billion year history can be reconstructed from the layered, twisted and folded rocks that adorn its surface.To understand how to read the planet's deep history, The Complete Earth descends far beneath the continents and oceans to reveal the tectonic plates they rest on. It explains how the ceaseless jostling of these plates has sculpted Earth's ever-changing face and tracks their movements over millennia to reconstruct global views of not only the planet's past, but also its future.",
