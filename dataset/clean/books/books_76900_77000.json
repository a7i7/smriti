        "Description": "It was the last-chance moment of the war. In January 2007, President George W. Bush announced a new strategy for Iraq. He called it the surge. \u201cMany listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure Baghdad did not. Well, here are the differences,\u201d he told a skeptical nation. Among those listening were the young, optimistic army infantry soldiers of the 2-16, the battalion nicknamed the Rangers. About to head to a vicious area of Baghdad, they decided the difference would be them.Fifteen months later, the soldiers returned home forever changed. Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter David Finkel was with them in Bagdad, and almost every grueling step of the way. What was the true story of the surge? And was it really a success? Those are the questions he grapples with in his remarkable report from the front lines. Combining the action of Mark Bowden\u2019s Black Hawk Down with the literary brio of Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Things They Carried, The Good Soldiers is an unforgettable work of reportage. And in telling the story of these good soldiers, the heroes and the ruined, David Finkel has also produced an eternal tale\u2014not just of the Iraq War, but of all wars, for all time.",

        "Description": "When the crash of the U. S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn\u2019t shine, and the SEC doesn\u2019t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can\u2019t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren\u2019t talking.The crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages? Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 best-selling Liar\u2019s Poker. Who got it right? he asks. Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of character made those few persist when their peers and colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles? Out of this handful of unlikely\u2014really unlikely\u2014heroes, Lewis fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his earlier bestsellers, proving yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our times.",

Countless  scholars have tried to define the charm of the Alice books\u2014with those wonderfully  eccentric characters the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum, and Tweedledee, the Cheshire  Cat, Mock Turtle, the Mad Hatter et al.\u2014by proclaiming that they really comprise  a satire on language, a political allegory, a parody of Victorian children\u2019s literature,  even a reflection of contemporary ecclesiastical history. Perhaps, as Dodgson might  have said, Alice is no more than a dream, a fairy tale about the trials and tribulations  of growing up\u2014or down, or all turned round\u2014as seen through the expert eyes of a child.",

        "Description": "The powerful story of slavery that has become a classic of American autobiography, now in an authoritative edition Frederick Douglass&#39;s autobiography,\u00a0Narrative of\u00a0the Life of Frederick Douglass,\u00a0An American Slave,\u00a0is widely regarded as a classic of American nineteenth-century history, of African-American studies, and of literature. In 1845, just seven years after his escape from slavery, the young Douglass published this powerful account of his life\u00a0as a slave\u00a0and his triumph over oppression. The book, which marked the beginning of Douglass\u2019s career as an impassioned writer, journalist, and orator for the abolitionist cause, reveals the terrors he faced as a slave, the brutalities of his owners and overseers, and his harrowing escape to the North.\u00a0 \u00a0 This edition of the book, based on the authoritative text that appears in Yale University Press\u2019s multivolume edition of the Frederick Douglass Papers, is the only edition of Douglass\u2019s Narrative designated as an Approved Text by the Modern Language Association\u2019s Committee on Scholarly Editions. It includes a chronology of Douglass\u2019s life, a thorough introduction by the eminent Douglass scholar John Blassingame, historical notes, and reader responses to the first edition of 1845. \u00a0 \u201cNone so dramatically as Douglass integrated both the horror and the great quest of the African-American experience into the deep stream of American autobiography. He advanced and extended that tradition and is rightfully designated one of its greatest practitioners.\u201d\u2014John W. Blassingame, from the introduction",

        "Description": "A layman's journey into the realm of probability-from poker to politics, weather to war, Monte Carlo to mortality  We search for certainty, but find only likelihood. All things are possible, only one thing actually happens; everything else is in the realm of probability. The twin disciplines of probability and statistics underpin every modern science and sketch the shape of all purposeful group activity- politics, economics, medicine, law, sports-giving humans a handle on the essential uncertainty of their existence. Yet while we are all aware of the hard facts, most of us still refuse to take account of probability-preferring to drive, not fly; buying into market blips; smoking cigarettes; denying we will ever age.  There are some people, though-gamblers, risk buyers, forensic experts, doctors, strategists- who find probability's mass of incomplete uncertainties delightful and revelatory. Chances Are is their story. Combining philosophical and historical background with portraits of the men and women who command the forces of probability, this engaging, wide-ranging, and clearly written volume will be welcomed not only by the proven audiences for popular books like E=MC2 and The Golden Ratio but by anyone interested in the workings of fate.",

The Encyclopedia consists of seven chronological sections from prehistory to present times, completed by a biographical Who's Who. Each section begins with a survey or overview describing the major features and trends of the period. Specialist articles follow, which interpret developments within the spheres of government and politics; warfare and international relations; economy, society (including living conditions); and culture (including education).    The interpretive articles are richly illustrated not only with specific visual records, buildings and portraiture, but also with representations of dress, housing, transport, and everyday objects, intended to give the reader as vivid a feeling as possible for each period consulted. Maps and genealogies are included wherever they are helpful.   Christopher Haigh is the editor of The English Reformation Revisited (CUP, 1987).",

        "Description": "The terrorist attacks of September 11 have turned the world\u2019s attention to areas of the globe about which we know very little. Ahmed Rashid, who masterfully explained Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban regime in his previous book, here turns his skills as an investigative journalist to the five Central Asian republics adjacent to Afghanistan. Central Asia is coming to play a vital strategic role in the war on terrorism, but the region also poses new threats to global security. The five Central Asian republics\u2014Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan\u2014were part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. Under Soviet rule, Islam was brutally suppressed, and that intolerance has continued under the post-Soviet regimes. Religious repression, political corruption, and the region\u2019s extreme poverty (unemployment rates exceed 80 percent in some areas) have created a fertile climate for militant Islamic fundamentalism. Often funded and trained by such organizations as Osama bin Laden\u2019s Al Qaeda and the Taliban, guerrilla movements like the IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan) have recruited a staggering number of members across the region and threaten to topple the governments of all five nations. Based on groundbreaking research and numerous interviews, Jihad explains the roots of militant rage in Central Asia, describes the goals and activities of these militant organizations, and suggests ways in which this threat could be neutralized by diplomatic and economic intervention.Rich in both cultural heritage and natural resources\u2014including massive oil reservoirs\u2014Central Asia remains desperately poor and frighteningly volatile. In tracing the history of Central Asia and explaining the current political climate, Rashid demonstrates that it is a region we ignore at our peril.",

If kids think pus and gas are fun, wait until they hear the lowdown on the real Dracula, samurai, gladiators, guillotines and vomitoriums, pirates, Vikings, witch trials, and the world\u2019s poxiest plagues. Impeccably researched, deliciously wry, and subversively educational (check out the toilet-paper timeline), OH, YIKES! covers people, events, institutions, and really bad ideas, alphabetically from April Fool\u2019s Day to zany Zoos. Here are the Aztecs, sacrificing 250,000 people a year for the gods\u2014and for food. Fearsome Attila the Hun, scourge of the steppes whose spinning eyes terrified his friends and whose mastery of horses terrorized his enemies (how does someone so evil die? Nosebleed!). Saur, the 11th-century dog-king of Norway (and not too bad as kings go). Henry VIII and his marital problems, the story of the Abominable Snowman and the Loch Ness Monster, why sailors in the old days preferred eating in the dark (hint: you can\u2019t see what\u2019s crawling in your food), and the answer to the question, \u201cHow did knights in armor go to the bathroom?\u201d Topped off with hundreds of illustrations and photographs along with hands-on activities that bring the past to life, OH, YIKES! puts the juice in history in a way that makes it irresistible.",
