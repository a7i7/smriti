The tough-talking, twenty-pound, tomcat PI is as feisty as ever as he and his gang try to keep his favorite roommate from losing her man. PR honcho Temple Barr\u2019s romance novelist aunt Kit has wound up in a romantic plot of her own. She\u2019s snagged one of the most eligible bachelors on the Strip, one of the elder Fontana brothers, a silver-tongued reputed ex-mobster with a heart of gold.  There is to be a wedding\u2026and where there is a wedding there is usually a bachelor party. Things go disastrously wrong when the entire party is hijacked and taken to a remote ranch out in the Nevada desert, a place where the women are wild and the sex is legal. And among the group?  None other than Temple\u2019s own Matt, an ex-priest.  Truly a fish out of water, he soon comes upon a beautiful young woman who is quite naked and most thoroughly dead. Given the remoteness of the location with very few suspects on hand (plus the Fontanas' shady reputation) this could be a very bad thing indeed.  And Louie?  Well, he managed to go along for the ride and once again it\u2019s up to that big old tomcat to bail out his humans and save the day. Cat in a Sapphire Slipper is a fast-paced, racy mystery with a loveable cast of characters and one terrific tough dude to keep them all in line.",

        "Description": "Milan, 1497. The height of the Renaissance. And for Giacomo, servant of the famous painter Leonardo da Vinci, it's the most difficult time of all. His Master has been working on the Last Supper, his greatest painting ever, for nearly two years. But has he finished it? He's barely started! The all-powerful Duke of Milan is demanding that it be completed by the time the Pope visits at Easter. And Giacomo knows that if Leonardo doesn't pick up his pace, the Duke may invite a young genius -- Michelangelo -- to finish the painting instead. Which means that Leonardo won't be paid, which means that Milan's shopkeepers (to whom he owes massive amounts) will take drastic measures against him.   It's all down to Giacomo, and whether he can come up with a brilliant solution. And if he does, will his Master go for it? After all, Leonardo still doesn't seem to trust him. He refuses to teach Giacomo how to paint; he won't help him find his parents; nor will he discuss the significance of the medallion, ring, and cross that Giacomo was carrying when Leonardo found him. But with the secret arrival of a powerful stranger, Giacomo is about to discover much more than the answers he has been looking for. And he will also receive an invitation to help arrange a meeting that could change his life. . . and the future course of history.   With more twists and turns than a spiral staircase, this thriller is as unique as its two heroes -- the most celebrated artist who ever lived, and a young man without a past, who will stop at nothing to find the truth about his life.",

Projects are imaginative (an outcast armoire spruced up with paint on the outside and fabric stapled to the inside) and easy to accomplish. \"Glue gun\" and \"staple gun\" pretty much covers the tool list. When fabric appears, as it often does, it's wrapped, draped, glued, twisted, and/or stapled; almost never is it sewn, and then only in the simplest fashion. From a faux fireplace to a graceful bed canopy, from decoupaged closet doors to sponge-painted end tables, Henderson provides all the inspiration, instructions, and sense of adventure any would-be decorator could want.",

Comparable to The Joy Luck Club in its honest portrayal of the American immigrant experience, Desirable Daughters follows the diverging paths taken by three Calcutta-born sisters as they come of age in a changing world. Tara, Padma, and Parvati were born into a wealthy Brahmin family presided over by their doting father and his traditionalist mother. Intelligent and artistic, the girls are nevertheless constrained by a society with little regard for women. Their subsequent rebellion will lead them in different directions, to different continents, and through different circumstances that strain yet ultimately strengthen their relationship. Moving effortlessly between generations, Mukherjee weaves together fascinating stories of the sisters' ancestors, their childhood memories, and dramatic scenes from India's history.",

The two veterans experience very different seasons--one on a team dealing with the pressure to get to a World Series for the first time in seven years, the other with a team expected to be there every year. Taking the reader through contract negotiations, spring training, the ups of wins and losses, and the people in their lives-family, managers, pitching coaches, agents, catchers, other pitchers--John Feinstein provides a true insider's look at the pressure cooker of sports at the highest level.",

        "Title": "The Poet of Baghdad: A True Story of Love and Defiance (Reader's Guide)",
        "Authors": "By Tatchell, Jo",
        "Description": "In the winter of 1979 Nabeel Yasin, Iraq's most famous young poet, gathered together a handful of belongings and fled Iraq with his wife and son.  Life in Baghdad had become intolerable.  Silenced by a series of brutal beatings at the hands of the Ba'ath Party's Secret Police and declared an \u201cenemy of the state,\u201d he faced certain death if he stayed. Nabeel had grown up in the late 1950s and early '60s in a large and loving family, amid the domestic drama typical of Iraq's new middle class, with his mother Sabria working as a seamstress to send all of her seven children to college. As his story unfolds, Nabeel meets his future wife and finds his poetic voice while he is a student.  But Saddam's rise to power ushers in a new era of repression, imprisonment and betrayal from which few families will escape intact.  In this new climate of intimidation and random violence Iraqis live in fear and silence; yet Nabeel\u2019s mother tells him \u201cIt is your duty to write.\u201d  His poetry, a blend of myth and history, attacks the regime determined to silence him. As  Nabeel\u2019s fame and influence as a poet grows, he is forced into hiding when the Party begins to dismantle the city\u2019s infrastructure and impose power cuts and food rationing.  Two of his brothers are already in prison and a third is used as a human minesweeper on the frontline of the Iran-Iraq war.   After six months in hiding, Nabeel escapes with his wife and young son to Beirut, Paris, Prague, Budapest, and finally England.Written by Jo Tatchell, a journalist who has spent many years in the Middle East and who is a close friend of Nabeel Yasin\u2019s, Nabeel's Song is the gripping story of a family and its fateful encounter with history. From a warm, lighthearted look at the Yasin family before the Saddam dictatorship, to the tale of Nabeel\u2019s persecution and daring flight, and the suspense-filled account of his family\u2019s rebellion against Saddam's regime, Nabeel's Song is an intimate, illuminating, deeply human chronicle of a country and a culture devastated by political repression and war.",

In 50 Ways to Train Your Cat, author Sally Franklin's easy training methods keep feline instincts in mind. You can achieve wonderful results by working with your cat's nature rather than against it. At the same time you'll create a deeper bond with your cat through increased interaction and positive reinforcement.

Sally Franklin's methods proceed at a cat's own pace, and bring even the most difficult skills within your cat's reach. By spending just a few minutes each day, you'll make life with your cat easier, happier and more fulfilling.",

This book covers every aspect of beginning sailing -- from hoisting sail to docking and anchoring -- and specifically prepares the learner to qualify for sailing certification according to international standards. Widely acclaimed author Gary Jobson has won several major races, including the 1977 America's Cup victory as tactician aboard Courageous. He was head sailing coach at the U.S. Naval Academy, and has conducted sailing clinics across the country. Illustrated step-by-step in two colors with over 150 line drawings and photographs.",

Why is it nearly impossible to succeed without faith?\u00a0 How much do family and friendships matter in our journey? How do we break down our walls and reveal our inner truths? What does having compassion really mean? How do you tell real friends apart from those who are holding you back? If there\u2019s no one to blame for my past, what do you do with your anger and resentment? These kinds of questions are the starting point toward fundamentally changing how you view past damaging relationships, toward breaking the debilitating grip of addiction and depression, toward injecting life with new meaning and purpose and toward helping you embark on a new journey based on hope, strength, and personal empowerment.As you unwrap each of the seven wonders for yourself, you\u2019ll discover exactly what Glenn Beck found as he transformed his own life from darkness to light, from dead ends to endless possibilities, from addiction to freedom: it doesn\u2019t take a superhero to find the strength to change\u2014it just takes the courage to take the first step.\u00a0 This book, which was only possible by combining together decades of personal struggle with world-class professional experience, can be that first step for you.The 7 Wonders grows out of a unique friendship that we\u2019ve developed over the last five-years. It is unique because it brought together a psychiatrist who naturally burrows toward the truth, and a recovering addict who spent decades running from it.As we spent more time together we began to let our guards down.\u00a0 Over time we reached a level of honesty with each other that is rare.\u00a0 As a result, we learned that the principles that have guided the well-honed healing techniques of one of us are precisely the same principles that instinctively guided the other to replace nearly unbearable pain with genuine happiness.We believe that it was God\u2019s plan for us to meet; that it was God\u2019s plan for us to speak so openly with one another; and it was God\u2019s plan that we share with you the seven wonders we discovered together.We also firmly believe that it was God\u2019s plan that this book now finds you at this exact moment in your life.\u00a0\u2014Glenn Beck & Dr. Keith Ablow",

        "Authors": "By Chua, Amy",
        "Description": "An awe-inspiring, often hilarious, and unerringly honest story of one mother's exercise in extreme parenting, revealing the rewards-and the costs-of raising her children the Chinese way.   All decent parents want to do what's best for their children. What Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother reveals is that the Chinese just have a totally different idea of how to do that. Western parents try to respect their children's individuality, encouraging them to pursue their true passions and providing a nurturing environment. The Chinese believe that the best way to protect your children is by preparing them for the future and arming them with skills, strong work habits, and inner confidence. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother chronicles Chua's iron-willed decision to raise her daughters, Sophia and Lulu, her way-the Chinese way-and the remarkable results her choice inspires.  Here are some things Amy Chua would never allow her daughters to do:  ? have a playdate  ? be in a school play  ? complain about not being in a school play  ? not be the #1 student in every subject except gym and drama  ? play any instrument other than the piano or violin  ? not play the piano or violin  The truth is Lulu and Sophia would never have had time for a playdate. They were too busy practicing their instruments (two to three hours a day and double sessions on the weekend) and perfecting their Mandarin.  Of course no one is perfect, including Chua herself. Witness this scene:  \"According to Sophia, here are three things I actually said to her at the piano as I supervised her practicing:  1. Oh my God, you're just getting worse and worse.  2. I'm going to count to three, then I want musicality.  3. If the next time's not PERFECT, I'm going to take all your stuffed animals and burn them!\"  But Chua demands as much of herself as she does of her daughters. And in her sacrifices-the exacting attention spent studying her daughters' performances, the office hours lost shuttling the girls to lessons-the depth of her love for her children becomes clear. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is an eye-opening exploration of the differences in Eastern and Western parenting- and the lessons parents and children everywhere teach one another.",
