        "Description": "Stop Aging Now! is based on hundreds of trailblazing studies by scientists from prestigious institutions, including Harvard University and the National Institutes of Health, who are discovering the incredible truth about the aging process: that much of it is not inevitable, and that what we call \"normal aging\" is actually often due to unsuspected deficiencies that can be readily corrected by taking antioxidant vitamins, minerals, herbs and food chemicals.Such \"youth potions\" can dramatically slow aging at any time of life and can even turn back the clock for people in their sixties, seventies and eighties. These antiaging potions are not only remarkably safe at effective dosages, but easily obtainable; they are in your food, in your vitamin bottle and in your health food store.In this exciting, groundbreaking guide organized in an easy-to-use format, you will find out exactly which antiaging supplements to take every day, and in what quantities, to forestall premature aging and regain vital functions. For example, leading scientists have discovered that: vitamins and minerals can rejuvenate immune functions, restoring youthful resistance to infectious diseases and cancer; certain vitamins can prevent and reverse memory loss and other signs of \"senility\"; herbs, such as ginkgo, can revitalize the circulatory system and brain functioning; natural antioxidants in foods and supplements can prevent clogged arteries, heart attacks and general bodily deterioration; and many unfamiliar but readily available food chemicals promise to stretch life expectancy and preserve or restore youth and vitality.With Stop Aging Now!, Jean Carper, nationally syndicated columnist and leading authority on health and nutrition, proves that everyone, at any age of life, can take action to slow down or reverse the aging process.",

With uncommon frankness, Korda writes of overcoming incontinence and impotence, the truth about various treatments, how tumors are graded, and the reality of the \"numbers.\" Man to Man alternates Korda's personal experiences, including the operation itself, with information and advice, as well as stories about his encounters with doctors, other patients, and the growing network of recovery groups.

        "Title": "Her Name Is Barbra: An Intimate Portrait of the Real Barbra Streisand",
        "Authors": "By Riese, Randall",
        "Description": "The name alone summons flashes of brilliant talent and temperament, explosive outbursts of demonstrative power, and an untamed ego. But, who is the real Barbra Streisand, the Jewish girl from Flatbush, who grew up to become the biggest multimedia star of her generation? Despite the thousands of articles and handful of books that have been written about her, that question remains unanswered. Until now.Randall Riese has uncovered the fascinating, startling, and often disturbing facts of Streisand's life. Hers is the ultimate Cinderella story: that of an ugly duckling whose father died when she was an infant. Her Name Is Barbra reveals for the first time the true account of Streisand's troubled, emotionally abused childhood.Now in her fourth decade of international music and movie stardom, Streisand, a woman of great paradox, shies away from an adoring public. She is not only afraid as is well known to sing in public, she also fears going out in public, taking public transportation, even using public restrooms. She has become as one of her friends puts it, \"one of the great introverts of our time.\"Ever since she arrived in Hollywood in 1967 to make Funny Girl, the film version of her Broadway smash, she has been depicted as the all-time bitch: cold, brash, obsessively controlling. Now Her Name Is Barbra reveals another side of Streisand, a side which the men in her life - Elliott Gould, Warren Beatty, Pierre Trudeau, Ryan O'Neal, Jon Peters, Don Johnson, Peter Weller, Andre Agassi, among them - have discovered for themselves.Her Name Is Barbra includes detailed, behind-the-scenes information, much of it never before revealed about her discovery in a gay nightclub in Greenwich Village; the Broadway shows that launched her career; and her films, including Funny Girl, The Way We Were, A Star Is Born, and Yentl, the last of which marked her official debut as a director. There is also an examination of her political leanings, from Kennedy to Clinton, and her activism, from feminism to AIDS awareness, and the role she played in the attempted boycott of Colorado antigay legislation.Her Name Is Barbra explores Streisand's strained relationships with her mother and sister, the friendships she abruptly severed on her rise to stardom, and her increasing closeness to her son, Jason. It was Barbra who raced to his defense when the tabloids falsely reported that he had gotten married - to another man. The book also examines the on-and off-set production of The Prince of Tides, a picture which, in many ways, was Barbra's attempt to confront and resolve the traumas of her childhood.Her Name Is Barbra is based on hundreds of interviews, personal anecdotes, archival information, court documents, and various other sources. Ambitious in scale, it is filled with fascinating detail and imbued with intimacy. Compassionate yet revealing, Her Name Is Barbra is worthy of its legendary subject.",

The law is anything I write on a scrap of paper.\u201d \u2014Saddam Hussein Taking readers into the darkest corners of a regime ruled by a volatile, brutal leader, Dr. Hamza, the only defector who has lived to write a firsthand portrait of Iraq, also presents an unprecedented portrait of Saddam\u2014his drunken rages, his women, his cold-blooded murder of underlings, and his unrivaled power.

        "Title": "The Clinton Wars",
        "Authors": "By Blumenthal, Sidney",
        "Description": "An invaluable history of an extraordinary presidency, and the chronicle of a generation\u2019s political odyssey When in 1997 Bill Clinton appointed Sidney Blumenthal as a senior advisor, the former writer was catapulted into the front lines of the Clinton wars. From his first day in the White House until long after his appearance as the only presidential aide ever to testify in an impeachment trial, Blumenthal acted in or witnessed nearly all the battles of the Clinton years. His major new book\u2014part history, part memoir\u2014is the first inside account we have of the presidency of William Jefferson Clinton.The Clinton Wars begins in 1987, when Blumenthal first met Bill and Hillary Clinton. His chronicle of Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign and first term draws on his experiences as confidant to both the President and the First Lady, and is enriched with previously unpublished revelations about both. This remarkable personal interpretation goes far in explaining the polarizing nature of Clinton\u2019s presence on the national scene. The narrative of Clinton\u2019s second term is even more dramatic. Blumenthal takes special note of the battle that was waged within the media between the President\u2019s detractors and defenders, which he expands into a vivid picture of Washington society torn apart by warring factions. But he does not neglect the wars fought on other fronts\u2014in Kosovo, against Congress, and for economic prosperity. His remarkable book ends with the inside story of the fight to elect Al Gore in 2000 and extend the legacy of the Clinton-Gore Administration. Every page of this unrivaled, authoritative book, with its intimate insights into Clinton\u2019s personality and politics, attests to Blumenthal\u2019s literary skill, profound understanding of politics, and unique perspective on crucial events of our recent past. The Clinton Wars is a lasting contribution to American history.",

But one day she receives a message that threatens the foundations of her marriage - a message she has craved and dreaded for thirty years:Dear Mrs. Ruth Anne, I believe you are my mother.What emerges is a secret dating back to 1968, when nineteen-year old Ruth Anne was a volunteer in a French convent in Saigon and where, at Tet, the celebratory pop of firecrackers gave way to the sound of gunfire. As Ruth Anne struggles to come to terms with her past - and Johnny grapples with his own memories of the war - Patricia Henley crafts a sensitive and beautifully written meditation on family and faith, and what it means to be moral in a world of conflicting moral codes.",

        "Description": "James Carville and Mary Matalin, lifetime political consultants, met and fell in love. They shared a dream: to direct a campaign for President of the United States. And then their dreams came true. Problem was, they had to campaign against each other.Welcome to All's Fair: Love, War, and Running for President, a political memoir like no other, written by the ultimate insiders. It's unquestionably the most provocative look at the running of a contemporary national election campaign in America. It is also a revealing account of how two political professionals managed to maintain their romance - and sanity - in the face of the most competitive of situations.Carville's and Matalin's strategies for Bill Clinton and George Bush unfold through unforgettable anecdotes and surprising portraits of the candidates, their staffs, and the more-powerful-than-ever media stars. How was the Gennifer Flowers affair defused? How did Pat Buchanan manage to sidetrack an incumbent President's reelection? How did Dan Quayle survive as the GOP's vice-presidential nominee? How did the Democrats inadvertently confirm the Republican charges that Clinton widely raised taxes in Arkansas? How did both Bush and Clinton judge - and then misjudge - Ross Perot's influence? Why was Carville called \"Serpenthead\"? And how did Matalin initiate the Sri Lanka Conga on Air Force One?The answers to such campaign mysteries large and small are found in All's Fair, a groundbreaking, breathtaking tour of the new universe of electronic electioneering and the old world of rivalry and romance. Written with the wit and outspokenness for which Carville and Matalin have become justly celebrated, their memoir provides a page-turning account of how the Republicans lost, the Democrats won, and love, eventually, triumphed over all.",

        "Description": "There were three deaths that summer. The first was Letitia's, sudden and quite unexpected, leaving her husband Thaddeus haunted by the details of her last afternoon, a drizzling Thursday in June. They had spent it arguing in their comfortable house in the country until Thaddeus reluctantly promised to visit a woman from his past - a promise he had no intention of keeping.The next death came some weeks later, after Thaddeus's mother-in-law had helped him to interview the young woman who had answered their advertisement for a nanny to look after Letitia's baby. None was suitable - least of all the last one, with her small, sharp features, her shabby clothes that reeked of cigarettes, her badly typed references - so Letitia's mother moved in herself. But then, just as the household was beginning to settle down, the last of the nannies suprisingly returned, her unwelcome arrival heralding the third of the summer tragedies.William Trevor's new novel is a sypathetic portrait of the sadness and damage that lies at the heart of some lives - both those that are obviously afflicted and those that appear to be blessed.",

        "Description": "Now available as an audio CD, in Eudora Welty's own voice, or as a book.Eudora Welty was born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi. In a \"continuous thread of revelation\" she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection: the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction.Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South--of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught--would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance. Until publication of this book, she had discouraged biographical investigations. It undoubtedly was not easy for this shy and reticent lady to undertake her own literary biography, to relive her own memories (painful as well as pleasant), to go through letters and photographs of her parents and grandparents. But we are in her debt, for the distillation of experience she offers us is a rare pleasure for her admirers, a treat to everyone who loves good writing and anyone who is interested in the seeds of creativity.",

We call ourselves the Gang of Five, but there are only four of us. We do it to keep people on their toes. Make 'em wonder. Or maybe we do it because we figure that there's one more kid out there who's going to need a gang to be a part of. A misfit, like us.  Skeezie, Addie, Joe, and Bobby -- they've been friends forever. They laugh together, have lunch together, and get together once a week at the Candy Kitchen to eat ice cream and talk about important issues. Life isn't always fair, but at least they have each other -- and all they really want to do is survive the seventh grade.  That turns out to be more of a challenge than any of them had anticipated. Starting with Addie's refusal to say the Pledge of Allegiance and her insistence on creating a new political party to run for student council, the Gang of Five is in for the ride of their lives. Along the way they will learn about politics and popularity, love and loss, and what it means to be a misfit. After years of getting by, they are given the chance to stand up and be seen -- not as the one-word jokes their classmates have tried to reduce them to, but as the full, complicated human beings they are just beginning to discover they truly are.",

To save the life of a young girl who's being stalked by a ruthless hit man, Lincoln and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Amelia Sachs, are called upon to do the impossible: solve a truly \"cold case\" -- one that's 140 years old.The Twelfth Card is a two-day cat-and-mouse chase through the streets of uptown Manhattan as quadriplegic detective Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs try to outguess Thompson Boyd -- by all appearances a nondescript, innocuous man, but one whose past has turned him into a killing machine as unfeeling and cunning as a wolf. Boyd is after Geneva Settle, a high school girl from Harlem, and it's up to Lincoln and Amelia to figure out why.The motive may have to do with a term paper that Geneva is writing about her ancestor, Charles Singleton, a former slave. A teacher and farmer in New York State, Charles was active in the early civil rights movement but was arrested for theft and disgraced. Assisted by their team, Fred Dellray, Mel Cooper and Lon Sellitto (suffering badly from a case of nerves due to a near miss by the killer), Lincoln and Amelia work frantically to figure out where the hired gun will strike next and stop him, all the while trying to determine what actually happened on that hot July night in 1868 when Charles was arrested. What went on at the mysterious meetings he attended in Gallows Heights, a neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that was a tense mix of wealthy financiers, political crooks like Boss Tweed and working-class laborers and thugs? And, most important for Geneva Settle's fate, what was the \"secret\" that tormented Charles's every waking hour?Deaver's inimitable plotting keeps all these stories -- the past and the present -- racing at a lightning-fast clip as we learn stunning revelations that strike at the very heart of the U.S. Constitution and that could have disastrous consequences for today's human and civil rights in America. With breathtaking twists and multiple surprises that will keep readers on tenterhooks until the last page, this is Deaver's most compelling Lincoln Rhyme book to date.",

        "Description": "In A Joyful Noise, Deborah Weisgall tells a moving story of her turbulent coming-of-age in the shadow of two remarkable men who lived life as if they were characters in an opera. The daughter of a mercurial composer and the granddaughter of a legendary cantor, Deborah as a child longed to be entrusted with their precious music and carry it on herself. But it was impossible; she was a girl. A Joyful Noise recounts Deborah's search for a place within the family tradition and, finally, her triumphant discovery of a way to make the men who would exclude her -- who were also the men she loved -- listen to her voice. A Joyful Noise is a tender, heartbreaking, beautifully written chronicle of the power of memory, the survival of faith, and the pursuit of a grand musical heritage. \"A superbly written chronicle encompassing the grand themes of the power of memory and the survival of faith.\" -- The Jewish Transcript; \"Weisgall has written a valuable book.\" -- The New York Times Book Review; \"This is a lovely memoir of life in the acutely functional family of a fine and learned composer. Deborah Weisgall writes of a milieu of discourse immersed in and emerging from music, and in which love and knowledge are not at odds. . . . A Joyful Noise is that of her own particular music of remembering.\" -- John Hollander; \"An absorbing memoir, with music in the background and foreground.\" -- New York Jewish Week.",

        "Title": "War Plan Iraq: Ten Reasons Against War with Iraq",
        "Authors": "By Rai, Milan",
        "Description": "War Plan Iraq brings together the arguments that can shake President Bush and Prime Minister Blair\u2019s determination to start an illegal war with Iraq. Despite Washington\u2019s claims that the only options are inaction or invasion and that \u2018inaction is not an option\u2019, War Plan Iraq demonstrates that inspection is an option, and that inspection and monitoring are the only way to ensure real disarmament in Iraq. For the Bush Administration, UN weapons inspectors are an obstacle to war; they are part of the problem, not part of the solution. War Plan Iraq uncovers Washington\u2019s hidden role in the collapse of the first UN weapons inspection agency, UNSCOM, and the paralysis of UNSCOM\u2019s successor, UNMOVIC. Based on the popular \u2018ARROW Anti-War briefings\u2019, War Plan Iraq rigorously dissects official propaganda and exposes government lies. This book demonstrates that the Bush\u2019s claims to change the regime in Iraq, despite intentions to impose another Sunni general to replace Saddam Hussein, are not in fact a \u2018regime change\u2019, but a \u2018leadership change\u2019. It also shows that the war would be in violation of international law; that there is no hard evidence that Iraq possesses any weapons of mass destruction; that there is no substantiated connection between the Government of Iraq, September 11th, and the al Qaeda network; that the proposed war carries a high risk of triggering a humanitarian disaster in Iraq, especially for the Kurds of northern Iraq; and that the war could precipitate a world recession with dire consequences for the world\u2019s poor. Iraq\u2019s neighbors, the ones most at risk from Iraq\u2019s weapons, are against the proposed war, as are top military professionals in Britain and the US, many international organizations and countries around the world, and a great majority of people in the US and the UK.",

Four Blondes tells the stories of four women facing up to the limitations of their rapidly approaching middle age in an era that worships youth. From the former \"It-girl\" heroine of \"Nice N'Easy,\" who each summer looks for a rich man who'll provide her with a house in the Hamptons, to the writer-narrator of \"Single Process,\" who goes to London on a hunt for love and a good magazine story, Bushnell brings to life contemporary women in search of something more -- when the world is pushing for them to settle for less. Sexy, funny, and wonderfully lush with gossip and scandal, Four Blondes will keep you turning pages long into the night.",

In a city where gods are omnipresent, where privacy is elusive and family defines identity, these men and women find themselves at the mercy of their desires but at the will of their society.

Heather Malone has made her home in Lake Henry for the last fourteen years. Known for her kind, gentle nature, she lives with Micah Smith, a widower, and his two young daughters. When the FBI takes her into custody on charges of flight to avoid prosecution, purportedly for a murder that took place in California, the local reaction is stunned disbelief. Yet, when those closest to her, including Micah, think back over the time they have known her, they realize that they have learned virtually nothing about her earlier life.   Poppy Blake is Heather's closest friend. A lifelong resident of Lake Henry, Poppy is confined to a wheelchair, the result of a snowmobile accident nearly a dozen years prior that left her a paraplegic and killed her male companion. Since then, she has worked hard to rebuild her life. Currently, she runs a local telephone messaging service out of her specially equipped house on Lake Henry. Fiercely independent, Poppy refuses to let her physical limitations break her spirit. However, it is her guilt over past mistakes, more than her present disability, which is holding her back from pursuing a future that includes a husband and family.  Writer Griffin Hughes originally traveled to Lake Henry to investigate a national news story involving Lily Blake, Poppy's older sister. What keeps him coming back is his attraction to Poppy. However, a chance comment made to his brother, an FBI agent, provides the thread that leads the law to Heather. To redeem himself, Griffin is compelled to solve the mystery of Heather's past. Along the way, he becomes key to freeing Poppy from her own past and helping her see the possibilities of a richer future.   Setting her story against the backdrop of a picturesque New England town during the maple syrup harvesting season, when the harshness of winter yields to the sweet promise of spring, and when the whole town is involved in the race to process the sap before the thaw sets in, Barbara Delinsky has written a tightly knit and compelling story that celebrates the values of community, friendship, and the redemptive power of love.
