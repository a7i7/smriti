        "Description": "Ruth loves to bake cakes. When she is alone, she dreams up variations on recipes. When she meditates, she imagines herself in the warm, comforting center of a gigantic bundt cake. If there is a crisis, she bakes a cake; if there is a reason to celebrate, she bakes a cake. Ruth sees it as an outward manifestation of an inner need to nurture her family\u2014which is a good thing, because all of a sudden that family is rapidly expanding. First, her mother moves in after robbers kick in her front door in broad daylight. Then Ruth\u2019s father, a lounge singer, who she\u2019s seen only occasionally throughout her life, shatters both wrists and, having nowhere else to go, moves in, too. Her mother and father just happen to hate each other with a deep and poisonous emotion reserved only for life-long enemies. Oh, yes indeed!Add to this mix two teenagers, a gainfully employed husband who is suddenly without a job, and a physical therapist with the instincts of a Cheryl Richardson and you\u2019ve got a delightful and amusing concoction that comes with its own delicious icing.One of Jeanne Ray\u2019s specialties is giving us believable, totally likable characters, engaged in the large and small dramas and amusements of life. Eat Cake is whimsical, warm, and satisfying. Eat Cake is Jeanne Ray at her best. Pull up a chair and eat cake!",

No lean library is complete without this groundbreaking book.\"The fundamentals of this system are applicable to every industry across the globea[and] will have a profound effect on human society.

        "Authors": "By Siddons, Anne Rivers",
        "Description": "From New York Times\u00a0bestselling author Anne Rivers Siddons comes a bittersweet and finely wrought story of friendship, family, and Charleston society.At twelve, Emily Parmenter knows alone all too well. Left mostly to herself after her beautiful young mother disappeared and her beloved older brother died, Emily is keenly aware of yearning and loss. Rather than be consumed by sadness, she has built a life around the faded plantation where her remote father and hunting-obsessed brothers raise the legendary Lowcountry Boykin hunting spaniels. It is a meager, narrow, masculine world, but to Emily it has magic: the storied deep-sea dolphins who come regularly to play in Sweetwater Creek; her extraordinary bond with the beautiful dogs she trains; her almost mystic communion with her own spaniel, Elvis; the dreaming old Lowcountry itself. Emily hides from the dreaded world here. It is enough.And then comes Lulu Foxworth, troubled daughter of a truly grand plantation, who has run away from her hectic Charleston debutante season to spend a healing summer with the quiet marshes and river, and the life-giving dogs. Where Emily's father sees their guest as an entr\u00e9e to a society he thought forever out of reach, Emily is at once threatened and mystified. Lulu has a powerful enchantment of her own, and this, along with the dark, crippling secret she brings with her, will inevitably blow Emily's magical water world apart and let the real one in\u2014but at a terrible price.Poignant and emotionally compelling, Sweetwater Creek draws you into the luminous landscape of the Lowcountry, with characters that will\u00a0linger long after you've turned the last page.",

        "Title": "Words I Wish I Wrote: A Collection of Writing That Inspired My Ideas",
        "Authors": "By Fulghum, Robert",
        "Description": "In Words I Wish I Wrote, Robert Fulghum reveals the works of writers who have inspired him.  During the past four decades he&#39;s reviewed and revised the basic principles of his philosophy many times, sometimes as an exercise in personal growth, but more often in response to individual crisis.  Then at fifty, seeking a simplicity to counter the complex thinking of his college years, Fulghum wrote a summary essay professing that all he really needed to know he learned in kindergarten.  As he approached his sixtieth year, Fulghum became curious about what in his outlook had changed and what had endured. On review, Fulghum explains, everything he has ever said and thought and written is transparent to him now.  As hard as he has tried to speak in his own voice, much of what he&#39;s said is neither original nor unique.  The best ideas are often old and are continually being revived, recycled, renewed.  Wherever his search took him, Fulghum found that someone else has been there before.  And more often than not, that person has chosen words Fulghum wishes he had written, using language he can&#39;t improve upon.  To Fulghum, however, this isn&#39;t a discouraging realization.  It&#39;s a recognition n of companionship, which is an affirming consolation. The confirming statements, quotes, and credos that Fulghum recorded in his journals for years are collected here, representing the most important ideas underlying his living and thinking.  They are organized thematically into such chapters as Companions, God, Bene-Dictions, Contra-Dictions, Simplify, and Believe.  Each begins with Fulghum&#39;s own insightful, introductory words, followed by inspiring passages drawn from a diverse group of sources, from Jerry Garcia to Albert Camus, Dylan Thomas to Franz Kafka.  At the end of each chapter, Fulghum offers readers his own personal commentary on the sources--where he was introduced to their words, why he returns to them again and again, and how they may change you.",

        "Description": "Growing up on his family's orchards in Appleton, Michigan, in the 1950s, Martin Dijksterhuis finds everything he needs in his extended family and in the land itself -- in the reassuring routines of growing and harvesting, spraying and pruning. Although his mother wants him to get out of Appleton, which she finds impossibly provincial, and attend a great university -- the University of Chicago, her alma mater -- he has no desire to leave.  In the autumn of his junior year of high school, however, in the camp of the migrant workers who come north every year to pick the Dijksterhuis peaches and apples, Martin discovers his vocation, the country blues -- unsettling melodies that cry out from a place in the soul he never knew existed. He also falls in love with Corinna Williams, the strong-willed daughter of the black foreman who runs the Dijksterhuis orchards. His blues vocation and his love for Corinna are the two stories of his life. His struggle to combine them into a single story takes him a long way from home and from the life he had always envisioned for himself, and then it brings him back again in a way he could never have imagined.  In this beautifully rendered novel, Robert Hellenga, author of The Sixteen Pleasures and The Fall of a Sparrow, explores the fragility of happiness, the difficulties of following one's calling in life, and the sorrows and satisfactions of being a parent.",

The Bookman's Promise marks the eagerly awaited return of Denver bookman-author John Dunning and the award-winning crime novel series that helped to turn the nation on to first-edition book collecting.  First, it was Booked to Die, then The Bookman's Wake. Now John Dunning fans, old and new, will rejoice in The Bookman's Promise, a richly nuanced new Janeway novel that juxtaposes past and present as Denver ex-cop and bookman Cliff Janeway searches for a book and a killer.  The quest begins when an old woman, Josephine Gallant, learns that Janeway has recently bought at auction a signed first edition by the legendary nineteenth-century explorer Richard Francis Burton. The book is a true classic, telling of Burton's journey (disguised as a Muslim) to the forbidden holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The Boston auction house was a distinguished and trustworthy firm, but provenance is sometimes murky and Josephine says the book is rightfully hers.  She believes that her grandfather, who was living in Baltimore more than eighty years ago, had a fabulous collection of Burton material, including a handwritten journal allegedly detailing Burton's undercover trip deep into the troubled American South in 1860. Josephine remembers the books from her childhood, but everything mysteriously disappeared shortly after her grandfather's death.  With little time left in her own life, Josephine begs for Janeway's promise: he must find her grandfather's collection. It's a virtually impossible task, Janeway suspects, as the books will no doubt have been sold and separated over the years, but how can he say no to a dying woman?  It seems that her grandfather, Charlie Warren, traveled south with Burton in the spring of 1860, just before the Civil War began. Was Burton a spy for Britain? What happened during the three months in Burton's travels for which there are no records? How did Charlie acquire his unique collection of Burton books? What will the journal, if it exists, reveal?  When a friend is murdered, possibly because of a Burton book, Janeway knows he must find the answers. Someone today is willing to kill to keep the secrets of the past, and Janeway's search will lead him east: To Baltimore, to a Pulitzer Prize-winning author with a very stuffed shirt, and to a pair of unorthodox booksellers. It reaches a fiery conclusion at Fort Sumter off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina.  What's more, a young lawyer, Erin d'Angelo, and ex-librarian Koko Bujak, have their own reasons for wanting to find the journal. But can Janeway trust them?  Rich with the insider's information on rare and collectible books that has made John Dunning famous, and with meticulously researched detail about a mesmerizing figure who may have played an unrecognized role in our Civil War, The Bookman's Promise is riveting entertainment from an extraordinarily gifted author who is as unique and special as the books he so clearly loves.",

        "Description": "Lisa Lewis' contribution to the understanding of biomedical aspects of autism has been considerable. Her informative booklet An Experimental Intervention for Autism combined scientific principles with practical advice for parents in a very readable way. Its availability on the Internet has made it one of the most widely read and influential pieces ever written on autism. Her new book also concentrates on the practical applications of knowledge and understanding. It is well researched, well written and very much needed.'- Paul Shattock, Autism Research Unit, University of SunderlandLisa Lewis explains, in this easy-to-read and accessible book, how and why to implement a dietary intervention strategy for helping children and adults with autism. Drawing upon her own success with removing gluten and casein from her son's diet, she answers the many questions parents and professionals might have about choosing a dietary intervention. Why choose a special diet? Are there tests to help me decide? Is there research to support this type of intervention? Will my child starve? What do I cook?In addition, she provides over 150 good-tasting recipes to get started on the diet -everything from spaghetti and meatballs to holiday treats and sweets and edible clay!",

        "Description": "The vertical/functional hierarchy has been the mainstay of business since the industrial revolution. But it has its problems. In fact, the vertical design all but guarantees fragmented tasks, overspecialization, fiefdoms, turf wars, the urge to control from the top--all the negatives that foster organizational paralysis. In The Horizontal Organization, Frank Ostroff provides executives with the first truly viable alternative to the age-old vertical alignment. Indeed, he offers nothing less than the first full view of what the organization of the future looks like and how it works.The concept of horizontal organization has been hailed in Fortune as \"a model corporation for the next fifty years\" and in aBusiness Week cover story as \"the real thing.\" But until now, management books have offered only piecemeal accounts of what the organization of the future might look like. Ostroff, a key developer of the concept of the horizontal organization, offers the first workable road map. He describes what the horizontal organization is, what it looks like, why it is important, how it helps improve performance, where it is appropriate, and how to develop it. The book contains real case examples that show how major international corporations (and one federal agency) have used Ostroff's concepts to meet their competitive goals. For instance, we see how Ford Motor Company's Customer Service Division turned to the horizontal organization to meet a highly ambitious goal--to get the customer's car fixed right, on time, the first time, at a competitive price, in convenient locations. We see how a horizontal design radically improved the performance of OSHA (the federal agency that oversees occupational safety), transforming it from a bureaucratic enforcer of regulations to a proactive problem-solver in a concerted effort to improve working conditions and save lives. And we see how Xerox combined both vertical and horizontal designs successfully, a case that underscores when a firm can best use the horizontal organization to achieve their goals. Ostroff also looks at a General Electric plant in North Carolina, Motorola's Space and Systems Technology Group, and the home finance division of Barclays Bank, highlighting how these major corporations have also used the horizontal organization to radically improve productivity. Many successful business books, such as Reengineering the Corporation andBeyond Reengineering, have given managers only a piece of the puzzle. Ostroff gives us the complete picture.The Horizontal Organization offers the first usable roadmap to the twenty-first-century firm. It is a book everyone who desires to radically improve the performance of their organization will want to read.",

Vowell searches the streets of Hoboken for traces of the town's favorite son, Frank Sinatra. She goes under cover of heavy makeup in an investigation of goth culture, blasts cannonballs into a hillside on a father-daughter outing, and maps her family's haunted history on a road trip down the Trail of Tears.

It was great to see many of the concepts with which we have experimented logically explained. I wholeheartedly endorse it.\"\u2014Jean Mayer, executive director, manufacturing procurement operations, Ford Motor CompanyLaseter and Booz-Allen coined the term \"balanced sourcing\" to describe a model for ensuring competitive pricing from suppliers while simultaneously nurturing cooperative relationships. Drawing upon Booz-Allen's experiences with leading companies, Balanced Sourcing lays out the six organizational capabilities that make up the firm's field-tested strategy. Detailed case studies of four prominent corporations-Honda of America, Cisco Systems, SUPERVALU, and Florida Power & Light-show you the broad applicability of this model for companies in industries from manufacturing to services to high-tech.\"Too many 'best practice' guides present a one-size-fits-all solution, such as copying the so-called Japanese model of sole sourcing. In fact, the best Japanese companies do not treat all suppliers as sole-sourced partners and you should not either.

The son of a Yale-educated investment banker, he grew up in a huge apartment on Sutton Place, high above the East River, and attended a tony Manhattan private school. Yet, more than anything, he wants to get out\u2013out from under his parents\u2019 influence, off to Graymont College, in western Massachusetts, where he hopes to become a writer.When he arrives, in the fall of 1986, Julian meets Carter Heinz, a scholarship student from California with whom he develops a strong but ambivalent friendship.  Carter\u2019s mother, desperate to save money for his college education, used to buy him reversible clothing, figuring she was getting two items for the price of one.  Now, spending time with Julian, Carter seethes with resentment.  He swears he will grow up to be wealthy\u2013wealthier, even, than Julian himself.  Then, one day, flipping through the college facebook, Julian and Carter see a photo of Mia Mendelsohn.  Mia from Montreal, they call her.  Beautiful, Jewish, the daughter of a physics professor at McGill, Mia is\u2013Julian and Carter agree\u2013dreamy, urbane, stylish, refined.But Julian gets to Mia first, meeting her by chance in the college laundry room.

        "Description": "Hundreds of millions of people around the globe suffer from hunger. But hunger, which has plagued the world for thousands of years, is a political condition, writes George McGovern in this plainspoken and necessary call to action. Ending it is a greater moral imperative than ever before because for the first time humanity has the tools and the knowledge to defeat this ancient enemy.  In The Third Freedom, McGovern lays out a workable and affordable five-point program to end world hunger. The basic facets include these steps:    The United States should take the lead within the UN in working toward a universal school lunch program.   The American supplemental nutrition program for low-income women, infants, and children should go worldwide.   The United Nations must establish food reserves around the globe.   Developing countries must be assisted in improving their own farm production, food processing, and food distribution.   High-yielding, scientific agriculture, including genetically modified crops, must be further encouraged and developed.   There are, of course, problems, concerns, and risks involved in ending world hunger while maintaining the prosperity of farmers, livestockmen, and dairymen, and protecting the global environment. McGovern addresses these and other issues in his logical, down-to-earth way. Understandably, some of the economic and social responses will be controversial. But as he passionately argues, one compelling moral issue is clear: Every major religion and ethical formulation commands its adherents to feed the hungry. We feed the hungry because it is right. McGovern argues persuasively that it will also be economically beneficial to all.  As someone who grew up on the plains of South Dakota during the drought and depression days of 1932, McGovern saw some of the world's best farmers flounder under surplus production that they could not sell for a break-even price. At the same time, he read of hunger and starvation in other parts of the world.

Bush\u2019s presidency, giving an insider\u2019s view of how Bush\u2019s unique presidential style and bold reforms are dramatically remaking the country\u2014and, indeed, the world. In the process, Barnes shows, the president is shaking up Washington and reshaping the conservative movement.Barnes has gained extraordinary access to the Bush administration for Rebel-in-Chief, conducting rare one-on-one interviews with President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and many other close presidential advisers. That access, along with Barnes\u2019s extensive independent reporting and interviewing, produces an eye-opening look at this highly consequential\u2014and controversial\u2014presidency.
