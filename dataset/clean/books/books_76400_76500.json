For twenty months, one American battalion after another tried to quell the violence, culminating in a bloody, full-scale assault.  Victory came at a terrible price: 151 Americans and thousands of Iraqis were left dead.The epic battle for Fallujah revealed the startling connections between policy and combat that are a part of the new reality of war.The Marines had planned to slip into Fallujah \u201cas soft as fog.\u201d  But after four American contractors were brutally murdered, President Bush ordered an attack on the city\u2013against the advice of the Marines.  The assault sparked a political firestorm, and the Marines were forced to withdraw amid controversy and confusion\u2013only to be ordered a second time to take a city that had become an inferno of hate and the lair of the archterrorist al-Zarqawi.Based on months spent with the battalions in Fallujah and hundreds of interviews at every level\u2013senior policymakers, negotiators, generals, and soldiers and Marines on the front lines\u2013No True Glory is a testament to the bravery of the American soldier and a cautionary tale about the complex\u2013and often costly\u2013interconnected roles of policy, politics, and battle in the twenty-first century.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Description": "Each year, the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps selects one book that he believes is both relevant and timeless for reading by all Marines. The Commandant's choice for 1993 was We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young. In November 1965, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Hal Moore, were dropped by helicopter into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was chopped to pieces. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. How these men persevered--sacrificed themselves for their comrades and never gave up--makes a vivid portrait of war at its most inspiring and devastating. General Moore and Joseph Galloway, the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting, have interviewed hundreds of men who fought there, including the North Vietnamese commanders. This devastating account rises above the specific ordeal it chronicles to present a picture of men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have found unimaginable only a few hours earlier. It reveals to us, as rarely before, man's most heroic and horrendous endeavor.",

        "Description": "Hey there, y'all!   My favorite recipes came direct from my momma and grandmommas. I just love goin' through all the recipe cards they passed on to me and readin' their handwritten notes; it makes me remember our good times in the kitchen, gathered round the table. Sometimes, though, I need a little remindin' when it comes to writin' down my own recipes and recollections, so I've put together this darlin' little journal to get me (and you) started recordin'. I know I never forget a meal, but I also know that Jamie and Bobby aren't always listenin' to what I'm tellin' 'em.   So for you and the boys, I've included some tried-and-true recipes and some of my hard-learned tricks for gettin' out of culinary scrapes -- and Lord, honey, have there been a few. Whether it is a real disaster -- the boss and his wife are comin' over and the kitchen is full of smoke (no shame in servin' some takeout) -- or just an everyday bump in the road -- your husband didn't hear the buzzer, and the cake got a little dry in the oven (let some sugar water soak into those layers, and no one will know the difference) -- I've got your answer. Just get cookin' and let loose: nothin' makes memories like the smell of home-cooked meals. Jot down your ingredients and your musings, cut out a recipe card or two to share with friends, keep track of who came to dinner, who liked what, and who laughed the loudest; remember the good times and learn from the bad. Like I always say, there's not much in life you can't learn in the kitchen.   Paula Deen",

But Sir Gerald Stapleton frequented Mrs. Blyth\u2019s euphemistically dubbed \u201cfinishing school\u201d for pure, uncomplicated pleasure\u2013and nothing else. So why was this confirmed bachelor so thoroughly captivated by one woman in particular? Why did he find himself wondering how such a rare jewel of grace, beauty, and refinement as Priss had ended up a courtesan? And when she needed protection, why did Gerald, who\u2019d sworn he\u2019d never get entangled in affairs of the heart, hasten to set her up as his own pampered mistress to ensure her safety\u2013and have her all to himself?For Priscilla Wentworth, the path leading to Sir Gerald\u2019s bed had been as filled with misfortune as it suddenly seemed charmed. But Priss couldn\u2019t allow herself to believe she\u2019d ever be more to a man like Sir Gerald than a well-cared-for object of pleasure. Now, despite Gerald\u2019s deep distrust of marriage, neither scandal nor society\u2019s censure can keep them apart\u2013only the fear of trusting their hearts.",

        "Description": "Spine-tingling and entertaining, The Invisible Man is a science fiction classic\u2013and a penetrating, unflinching look into the heart of human nature. To its author, H. G. Wells, the novel was as compelling as \u201ca good gripping dream.\u201d But to generations of readers, the terrible and evil experiment of the demented scientist, Griffin, has conveyed a chilling nightmare of believable horror. An atmosphere of ever-increasing suspense begins with the arrival of a mysterious stranger at an English village inn and builds relentlessly to the stark terror of a victim pursued by a maniacal invisible man. The result is a masterwork: a dazzling display of the brilliant imagination, psychological insight, and literary craftsmanship that made H. G. Wells one of the most influential writers of his time.",

A mysterious lodestone whose powers affected metal was known to the Chinese emperor. When this piece of metal was suspended in water, it always pointed north. This unexplainable occurrence led to the stone's use in feng shui, the Chinese art of finding the right location. However, it was the Italians, more than a thousand years later, who discovered the ultimate destiny of the lodestone and unleashed its formidable powers. In Amalfi sometime in the twelfth century, the compass was born, crowning the Italians as the new rulers of the seas and heralding the onset of the modern world. Retracing the roots of the compass and sharing the fascinating story of navigation through the ages, The Riddle of the Compass is Aczel at his most entertaining and insightful.",

        "Description": "\"Instruction and appreciation become one in this book.\" \u2014 School ArtsSculpture: Principles and Practice is one of the most authoritative and comprehensive books on the creation of sculpture. Unlike other instructional guides by people who have never had their fingers wet with clay, this book is the accumulation of many years of practical knowledge and experience by a noted American sculptor and art instructor.Mr. Slobodkin starts with the very basics of the art and leaves no area uncovered. He advises the novice what type of material is best to work with, and in a step-by-step process shows how to begin with elementary forms and proceed to the more complex, used for creating human figures, portrait heads, bas reliefs, and other forms of sculpture. Helpful instruction and diagrams of the proper procedure for constructing armatures and the proper methods for the use of tools are passed on to the reader along the way.When the use of clay and plasteline are well in hand, Mr. Slobodkin moves to the handling of more difficult materials. Plaster casting, wood carving, stone carving, terra cotta, metal sculpture, and architectural sculpture are all covered with hundreds of drawings and progressive photographs to add clarity. A most welcome aspect of this book is the author's witty and readable style. Technical passages never become oppressive, and words of encouragement and inspiration are offered frequently. One is well aware that the author was once a novice and facing the same difficulties himself. For the beginner this book is invaluable, but even those who have been sculpting for years will find the latter chapters full of helpful hints and useful information.",
