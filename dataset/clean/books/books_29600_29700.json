        "Title": "Winning with the Dow's Losers: Beat the Market with Underdog Stocks",
        "Authors": "By Carlson, Charles B.",
        "Description": "In the course of his research, bestselling author and market expert Charles B. Carlson noticed a surprising trend in the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the worst-performing stocks in one year turned out to be among the best-performing stocks the following year.For example, the worst performer in the Dow in 1999 was Philip Morris, declining 57 percent during the year. In 2000, however, Philip Morris was the best-performing Dow stock, rising 91 percent and far outpacing the Dow's negative 6-percent return. Something similar happened with AT&T, which hit bottom in 2000 and bounced back in 2001. And Eastman Kodak, which was among the 10 worst performers in the Dow in 2001, was the best-performing Dow stock in 2002, gaining 26 percent versus a 15-percent loss in the Dow the year before.These simple observations, now backed by extensive research, have become the basis of a new and startlingly effective method of stock investing that is the subject of this book. Carlson's \"worst-to-first\" strategy yields amazing results again and again. In fact, if you simply invested in the worst-performing Dow stock each year beginning with $1,000 in 1983, your nest egg would have grown to an astounding $68,000 by the end of 2002. In contrast, an investment in the Dow Jones Industrial Average would have netted only $14,000.In Winning with the Dow's Losers, Carlson shows how an investor, with any size portfolio or any level of investment knowledge, can employ this simple, sound, and time-tested strategy to generate impressive wealth over the long term.Start with as little as $1,000.Invest in as few as 1 or as many as 10 Dow stocks.Review and adjust your portfolio no more than once a year.Achieve better results than the famous \"Dogs of the   Dow\" approach.Stock market fads come and go. Investors who chase them usually enrich their stockbrokers and not themselves. Not any longer. Now, with the help of Winning with the Dow's Losers, you can pick winning stocks year after year.",

Today, David Mixner is considered one of the most influential voices in American politics. He has earned the respect of the nation's most prominent policy-makers and inspired the rage of those to whom he has refused to defer. Mixner's story is not only a chronicle of one man's profound influence on many of the major human rights movements of our time. It's about what it means to be American: standing up for what you believe and believing you can make a difference.But Mixner's achievements have not come without cost to his personal life. In these pages, he writes with brutal honesty about how he felt compelled to hide his homosexuality from his colleagues, and their cool response to his coming out.",

        "Description": "A business powerhouse and mother of four who has led America's most popular magazines -- including Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Us Weekly, and Star -- to record successes, Bonnie Fuller has, until now, been an immensely private person. But in The Joys of Much Too Much, she shares an unthinkable secret: the key to happiness is not a balanced life but one that is maxed out with a career, romance, and family. Not only can you have it all, but you shouldn't settle for anything less. In The Joys of Much Too Much she provides a blueprint for having everything you want personally and professionally -- even if you're afraid you don't have what it takes. For the first time, Fuller tells with astonishing candor what it was like to be an awkward, shy girl from a middle-class Jewish family who learned through hard-won successes and painful failures how to invent the over-the-top life she wanted. Using personal anecdotes from her home and professional lives, Fuller describes the unusual coping methods that have made her happily unbalanced life work for her (hint: check your lettuce in the coatroom). In this straight-shooting, inspiring how-to, Fuller shows readers how to turn negatives into positives, squeeze the very most out of every chaotic minute, and embrace the unknown. The Joys of Much Too Much will lead you to envision more for yourself, go for it -- and then get it.",

        "Description": "The dark earth in the piedmont of North Carolina's Randolph County is heavy with bright red clay. And it is this same rich soil that attracts many of the South's most skilled potters. Also drawn to this region is the visiting judge Deborah Knott, who is there for decidedly different reasons. Deborah faces the most exasperating case a judge can handle - overseeing the equitable distribution of marital property. The antagonists are James Lucas Nordan and Sandra Kay Hitchcock, both potters who are bitterly divorcing after almost twenty-five years of marriage. As creative as it was stormy, the Nordans' history together produced great artistic achievements. Much of the credit for this stellar legacy can go to Amos Nordan, James Lucas's father and the proud clan patriarch. At the same time, old Amos is no stranger to tragedy. Two years earlier, his more talented son, Donny, apparently committed suicide in a manner so scandalous that Amos still can't bear to speak of it.Suddenly, amid the petty bickering, an even more gruesome death strikes the Nordans again. Violence, seemingly borne out of Providence, stalks the family homestead as the sins of the past catch up with the Nordan family. Judge Knott knows she must summon all of her considerable insight into the darkest entanglements of the human heart, if she is to stop a most human specter, well-crafted in the art of murder.",

        "Description": "In Conflict and Compromise Ronald D. Elving follows the odyssey of one important piece of legislation in a behind-the-scenes look at how Congress works, from the drafting of a bill to the wooing of sponsors, from the politics of a presidential veto to the parliamentary maneuvering that can mean legislative life or death.The Family and Medical Leave Act originated in the mid-1980s, when California legislators tried to protect women's right to return to their jobs following maternity-related leaves. But even before the formal legislation was introduced, it was expanded beyond birth-related conditions. And over time it would be broadened further to bring aboard the varied constituencies needed for passage. Elving explains how the prospect of major new social legislation brought out powerful lobbyists on both sides of the bill, and how they in turn orchestrated popular support to influence key legislators.By its nature, the bill cut across party lines, attracting advocates and adversaries on either side of the aisle. It also confounded ideological divisions: Because it was federal legislation on social policy it struck some conservatives as an intrusive mandate on private business, yet it appealed to others as an affirmation of family values.But while outside forces gathered to press their competing cases in Capitol hallways, intense political maneuvering among individual members, committees, and factions determined whether the bill would reach the floor for action or languish on the list of legislative ideas.",

A White House adviser to four presidents, both Republican and Democrat, he offers a vivid, behind-the-scenes account of their struggles to exercise power and draws from them key lessons for leaders of the future. Taking us inside the administrations of Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton, Gergen reflects on everything from why Nixon was the best global strategist among recent presidents to how the Bill-and-Hillary seesaw rocked the White House during Clinton's tenure as president.  Gergen argues that, as the twenty-first century begins, our success as a country will depend heavily upon the success of a new generation in power. Drawing upon his many experiences in the White House, he offers seven vital elements for future leaders. What they must have, he says, are inner mastery; a central, compelling purpose rooted in moral values; a capacity to persuade; skills in working within the system; a fast start; a strong, effective team; and a passion that inspires others to keep the flame alive.",

Now, Lisa Tucker returns with a starkly lyrical novel of page-turning intensity and rare emotional power.  Patty Taylor can handle anything. So what if the guys in her band dismiss her as just a pretty face, hired by their manager to make them more popular? She's already survived a bad childhood, a destructive teenage relationship, homelessness, and working twelve-hour shifts washing dishes. Traveling with the band gives her a way to provide for Willie, the two-year-old son she adores.  But on a hot summer day in Kentucky, when Willie's father shows up outside her hotel room, newly paroled from prison and intent on having her and his son back, Patty begins a journey that will change her from a girl who can put up with anything to a woman with a voice that can bring the house down. Shout Down the Moon is about following dreams and overcoming obstacles, about finding your voice and becoming the hero of your own life. In Patty Taylor, Lisa Tucker has created an unlikely heroine, a gutsy girl with a wry sense of humor, whose life will depend on having the courage to trust in her big talent and even bigger heart.",

        "Title": "Speaking Freely: A Guided Tour of American English from Plymouth Rock to Silicon Valley",
        "Authors": "By SOUKHANOV, Anne H. and Flexner, Stuart Berg",
        "Description": "How in the world could a loud mouth turn into a trombone and then become a bazooka? With words, anything is possible, especially if they happen to be American words. The continuous influx of immigrants with their distinctive dialects, the impulse to improvise and experiment, and the relative freedom from rigid social restraints all make America the perfect place for language to percolate, to take on ever-changing shapes and textures and flavors, and to produce an inexhaustible supply of expressive possibilities.  In the case of bazooka, we begin with a Dutch word, bazoo, meaning \"loud mouth,\" move to an American comedian, Bob Burns, who called his homemade trombone a bazooka, and end with a U.S. Army Major who saw Burns's act and commandeered the word to name a new anti-tank rocket launcher you could hold on your shoulder.      Now, in Speaking Freely, Anne H. Soukhanov, author of the Word Watch column in the Atlantic Monthly and one of America's leading lexicographers, invites us into the irresistible world of words. Drawing on  Stuart Berg Flexner's two most popular books--I Hear America Talking and Listening to America--and adding 40 per cent new material that covers the enormous changes in language over the past twenty years, Soukhanov provides a sweeping look at the richness and astonishing variety of American English. Here we discover not only the origin and history of many of our most delightful words but also the changing cultural conditions that produced them. With chapters on Americanisms, cyberspace, advertising, fighting words, fitness, geography, economics, sex, crime, gender, generation gaps, and many other subjects, Speaking Freely covers the whole spectrum of language in America from the Pilgrims to the present. In the chapter on American's love affair with booze, for instance, we have a rollicking history of all the delectable words we've devised to describe the condition of drunkenness and its insalubrious effects. If, for example, you were to find yourself frequently groggified, half-shaved, full as a fiddler's fart, balmy, owly-eyed, pifflicated, comboozelated, tanglefooted, ossified, petrified, snockered, or wazzocked, you would often suffer the jim-jams, the jitters, the heebie-jeebies, or the screaming meamies the next day, and would eventually come to be seen as an elbow-bender, a guzzler, a rumhead, swiller, or tosspot. Speaking Freely also explains the droves of new expressions entering our vocabularies--the recent concern with ecology giving us such words as biodiversity, ecofriendly, and chloroflurocarbons, and the rise of the personal computer creating a plethora of distinctive terms, from floppy disk, homepage, and hackers to flammage, spam campaigns, barfogenesis, clickstream, cobweb site, cybercreep, and vaporware.       Beautifully printed, with over 400 illustrations and a generous offering of quotations from Thomas Jefferson and Mark Twain to Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Hardwick, and many others, Speaking Freely takes the lid off the American language and shows us where it is, where it's been, and why it's ours.",

You'll get fresh insights into: the story of Abraham and how he came to worship one God; the development of writing that offered an exciting new way of preserving biblical tradition; the conquests of David and the building of Solomon's Temple and how these events spurred biblical writing; the four Gospels and the men who wrote them; and the spread of the Gospel from the end of the first century to the end of the second millennium.Drawing on the latest scholarly research and archeological finds, The Bible Through the Ages sheds light on the editorial decisions that shaped the Bible and the controversies that often surrounded them. It discusses the significance of the Dead Sea Scrolls and what they teach us about the text of the Bible.In these pages, you'll discover how the words of the Bible were preserved - from early Hebrew texts of the Old Testament to the translations of the New Testament from Greek into Latin and the vernacular languages of Europe.The people who spread the Word are here, too: ancient scholars who collected letters, histories, songs, and poems into a single volume of sacred writings; monks who painstakingly copied the texts during the Middle Ages; and the fearless missionaries who carried the Bible and its message to remote corners of the earth.Photographs, maps, and reconstructions of ancient sites transport you back in time and place. Magnificent illuminations from medieval manuscripts, finely sewn tapestries, and master works of art demonstrate the impact of the Bible on the creative imagination throughout the centuries.",

With twists as plentiful as those found on the holler roads of southwest Virginia, this story takes turns that will surprise and enthrall the reader.Transporting us from Ave Maria's home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Italian Alps, from New York City to the Tuscan countryside, Milk Glass Moon is the story of a shifting mother-daughter relationship, of a daughter's first love and a mother's heartbreak, of an enduring marriage that contains its own ongoing challenges, and of a community faced with seismic change.All of Trigiani's beloved characters are back: Jack Mac, Ave Maria's true love, who is willing to gamble security for the unknown; her best friend and confidant, bandleader Theodore Tip-ton, who begins a new life in New York City; librarian and sexpert Iva Lou Wade Makin, who faces a life-or-death crisis. Meanwhile, surprises emerge in the blossoming of crusty cashier Fleeta Mullins, the maturing of mountain girl turned savvy businesswoman Pearl Grimes, and the return of Pete Rutledge, the handsome stranger who turned Ave Maria's world upside down in Big Cherry Holler. In this rollicking hayride of upheaval and change, Ave Maria is led to places she never dreamed she would go, and to people who enter her life and rock its foundation. As Ave Maria reaches into the past to find answers to the present, readers will stay with her every step of the way, rooting for the onetime town spinster who embraced love and made a family. Milk Glass Moon is about the power of love and its abiding truth, and captures Trigiani at her most lyrical and heartfelt.",

When he lifts his lantern to get a better look, the candlelight reveals that she is his mother. He gives her his cloak and only then sees the truth: She is not his mother after all, but a stranger.

        "Description": "SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE For the past forty years, the homosexual activist movement has sought to implement a master plan to utterly destroy the family. Unelectable and unaccountable rogue judges have made a habit of inventing rights that not only don\u2019t exist in the Constitution, but also contradict both the will of the people and the actions of the legislative branch. Christians around the world have scrambled, wondering how to respond. How do we discuss this intelligently? What can we do to make our voices heard? In his newest release, Marriage Under Fire, Dr. Dobson addresses the dire ramifications of judicial activism and presents compelling arguments against the legalization of homosexual unions\u2014mobilizing the Christian community to respond to a call to action. \"I understand both the busy-ness of daily life and the intimidation that the average man or woman feels in the face of this overwhelming cultural challenge. But we need to work together. Maybe you want to make a difference but you simply don\u2019t know what to do. May this book encourage you for the battle ahead, as we fight to save the institution of the family .\" --Dr. James DobsonWhy Not \"Gay Marriage\"?  Why shouldn't the definition of family be broadened and modernized? What harm could be done by two consenting adults who love one another coming together to create a binding union?  In this succinct analysis of the issue, Dr. James Dobson presents a compelling case against the legalization of \u201cmarriage\u201d between homosexuals and the dire ramifications our nation could face:   Same-sex marriage will destroy the fundamental principles of marriage, parenthood, and gender. Families will be increasingly unstable as their definition expands to incorporate multiple \u201cmoms\u201d or \u201cdads\u201d. Legalization of gay marriages will lead to polygamy and other alternatives to one-man/one-woman unions. The divorce rate will be higher, making our children less safe.  Marriage Under Fire provides the foundations of a battle plan for the preservation of traditional values in our nation. Our response could not be clearer. The well-being of the family, and thus our nation, hangs in the balance. Now is the time to speak out in defense of marriage and the American family. Story Behind the BookI write to you today with a profound sense of concern and apprehension for the welfare of the family, and indeed for the future of our nation. I do not recall a time since the beginnings of Focus on the Family twenty-seven years ago when the institution of marriage faced such peril or when the forces arrayed against it were more formidable or determined. Barring a miracle, the family as it has been known for more than five millennia will crumble, presaging the fall of Western civilization itself. This is a time for concerted prayer, divine wisdom, and greater courage than we have ever been called upon to exercise.",
