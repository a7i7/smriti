We see close up the background of each scientist involved in the project. We discover how they work together; how their complementary skills - and their differences - are instrumental in their formation of hypotheses about our origins, and how these hypotheses must be proven or modified one by one if we are to find explanations for phenomena that can rarely be directly observed in detail.We watch the team probing intergalactic space and arriving ultimately at the discovery that our Milky Way galaxy and its neighbors are moving toward a Great Attractor - a distant continent of matter, mostly invisible, containing thousands of galaxies.A gripping account and exploration - clear and challenging and poetic - of what drives the scientist to feats of discovery: the search for order and the overwhelming need to know why things happen as they do.",

        "Title": "After Iraq: The Imperiled American Imperium",
        "Authors": "By Kegley, Charles W., Jr. and Raymond, Gregory A.",
        "Description": "As the year 2001 unfolded, the United States stood at the apex of global power, possessing unrivalled military capabilities, a vibrant economy, and--most of all--great self-confidence about its security. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 shattered America's prevailing illusions of invulnerability, prompting the world's sole superpower to embark on a revolutionary national strategy that led to a preventive war against Iraq. Will the United States be safer and more secure as a result? This book shows why America's new assertively unilateral foreign policy will actually create perils for the next generation of Americans. Written by two seasoned scholars, After Iraq conducts a sweeping survey of America's present position in the global arena and identifies the opportunities and risks that the United States will likely face once the war in Iraq draws to a close. Kegley and Raymond provide an insightful overview of the U.S. response to the unconventional threats posed by global terrorism as well as a searching assessment of the challenges created by the rise of China and other emerging competitors. They argue that the current course of American foreign policy will harm the country by setting dangerous precedents that undermine the moral and legal restraints--which were built painstakingly over the past century--on when and how states may use force. Drawing upon a rich array of historical parallels and empirical evidence, the book illuminates instances in which previous great powers embarked on similar self-defeating strategies. Like the U.S. today, these states once stood at the pinnacle of world power. But due to misperceptions about what they could accomplish with unilateral, preventive uses of military force, they made short-run decisions that undermined their long-term strategic interests. With Americans facing questions about how to combat global terrorism, how to diffuse the nuclear threats of Iran and North Korea, how to adjust to the growing power of China and India, and how to repair relations with traditional allies, After Iraq charts a path for restoring America's reputation and leadership in the world to strengthen both U.S. and international security in the turbulent decades ahead.",

Among the victims of this tragedy were Thomas Keneally's own forebearers, and they were his inspiration to tell the story of the Irish who struggled and ultimately triumphed in Australia and North America. Relying on rare primary sources--including personal letters, court transcripts, ship manifests, and military documents--Keneally offers new and important insights into the impact of the Irish in exile. The result is a vivid saga of heroes and villains, from Great Famine protesters to American Civil War generals to great orators and politicians.",

        "Description": "Now in a new fifth edition, The American Presidency: Origins and Development, 1776-2007\u2014winner of the Benjamin Franklin Award for History, Politics, and Philosophy\u2014examines both the constitutional precepts of the presidency and the social, economic, political, and international conditions that continue to shape it. Authors Sidney Milkis and Michael Nelson analyze the origins of the modern presidency and discuss the patterns of presidential conduct that developed during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and continue into the twenty-first. With careful consideration of every presidential administration, attention is focused more on how individual presidents shaped the institution, and less on the idiosyncrasies of their personalities. Unlike other texts on the presidency that divide executive politics into discrete topical chapters, The American Presidency integrates all aspects of the presidency into a dynamic whole and examines the variation of presidential relationships and roles from administration to administration. Students gain both an understanding of the office as it really exists and a solid historical foundation from which to better appreciate its evolution.Thoroughly updated, the fifth edition provides complete coverage of the George W. Bush administration, up to and including the 2004 and 2006 elections. The authors meticulously take into account new research on the presidency, while continuing to refine the writing and analysis of what has become a classic in the field.",

        "Authors": "By Hart, Christopher",
        "Description": "From head to toe, the human form, in all its complexities, is visually simplified to such a degree in this remarkable workbook that even complete beginners will soon be able to draw accurate, well-proportioned faces and figures every time they try. Avoiding complex charts of muscles and bones that are more helpful to doctors than to artists, this book\u2019s refreshing approach teaches anatomy from a cartoonist/illustrator\u2019s point of view. For example, there are many large and small muscles in the neck, all rendered in great detail in most anatomy books, but here, master teacher Christopher Hart shows only the four that are visible and need to be drawn. His clear instruction helps readers to visualize and portray shifting body weight in a pose without the need of a model, and instead of showing a mass of facial muscles and bones, he translates them into the simple planes an artist needs to draw a range of expressive faces.",

        "Description": "How free-market economies really work(and why they work so well)Are free market economies really based on fleecing the consumer? Is the U.S. economy truly just a giant free-for-all that encourages duplicity in our everyday transactions? Is everyone from corporate CEOs to your local car salesman really looking to make a buck at your expense?In Freedomnomics: Why the Free Market Works and Other Half-Baked Theories Don't,economist and bestselling author John R. Lott, Jr., answers these and other common economic questions, bravely confronting the profound distrust of the market that the bestselling book Freakonomics has helped to popularize. Using clear and hard-hitting examples, Lott shows how free markets liberate the best, most creative, and most generous aspects of our society--while efforts to constrain economic liberty, no matterhow well-intentioned, invariably lead to increased poverty and injustice. Extendingits rigorous economic analysis even further to our political and criminal justicesystems, Freedomnomics reveals:? How the free market creates incentives for people to behave honestly? How political campaign restrictions keep incumbents in power? Why legalized abortion leads to family breakdown, which creates more crime? Why affirmative action in police departments leads to higher crime rates? How women's suffrage led to a massive increase in the size of government\u00b7 Why women become more conservative when they get married and moreliberal when they get divorced? How secret ballots reduce voter participation? Why state-owned companies and government agencies are much more likely to engage in unfair predation than are private firms? Why the controversial assertions made in the trendy book Freakonomics are almost entirely wrongEntertaining, persuasive, and based on dozens of economic studies spanning decades, Freedomnomics not only shows how free markets really work--but proves that, when it comes to promoting prosperity and economic justice, nothing works better.",

But today, thanks to incredible new medical advances, each of these individuals is alive and well . . .Cheating Death.In this riveting book, Dr. Sanjay Gupta-neurosurgeon, chief medical correspondent for CNN, and bestselling author-chronicles the almost unbelievable science that has made these seemingly miraculous recoveries possible. A bold new breed of doctors has achieved amazing rescues by refusing to accept that any life is irretrievably lost. Extended cardiac arrest, \"brain death,\" not breathing for over an hour-all these conditions used to be considered inevitably fatal, but they no longer are. Today, revolutionary advances are blurring the traditional line between life and death in fascinating ways.Drawing on real-life stories and using his unprecedented access to the latest medical research, Dr. Gupta dramatically presents exciting accounts of how pioneering physicians and researchers are altering our understanding of how the human body functions when it comes to survival-and why more and more patients who once would have died are now alive. From experiments with therapeutic hypothermia to save comatose stroke or heart attack victims to lifesaving operations in utero to the study of animal hibernation to help wounded soldiers on far-off battlefields, these remarkable case histories transform and enrich all our assumptions about the true nature of death and life.",

This easy-to-read, profusely illustrated guide to the history, symbolism, and construction of heraldic devices allows even a child to fashion authentic designs.Step-by-step directions tell how to trace the shape of the shield and its divisions and how to select symbols that reflect personal origins, traits, and achievements. (Forty-seven illustrations include human forms and manmade objects such as forearms, helmets, crowns, whips, books, crosses, bells, and much more. Celestial, plant, and animal shapes include suns, roses, trees, eagles, bars, dolphins, dragons, and serpents.) You'll find tips on necessary materials, how to color and outline your design, how to achieve professional results, and even how to register your coat of arms. You'll also find sample coats of arms belonging to some of the world's most famous people, corporations, and nations.Once you've finished your emblem, you may want to display your work on personal belongings such as a hooked rug, a wall hanging, or other needlecraft projects. Decorate a plate, mug, or other ceramic objects \u2014 or make sew-on patches, pin-on badges, and T-shirt decals. Rubber stamps, bookplates, stationery, and jewelry can be custom-made to depict your coat of arms.Here's a book for lovers of traditional design and for those interested in the study of family histories, relationships, and accomplishments \u2014 a veritable treasury of information for anyone wishing to display his or her family's roots in a long-cherished form.",

Her employer takes inappropriate liberties, and as Verna matures, it seems as if each man she meets is worse than the last. Through sheer force of will and a few chance encounters, she manages to teach herself to read and becomes a nurse. But Verna\u2019s new life falls to pieces when she is arrested for assisting a black doctor with \"illegal surgeries.\" As the media firestorm rages, Verna reflects on her life while awaiting trial. Based on the life of the author\u2019s own grandmother and written after almost three hundred interviews with those involved in the real-life scandal, The Blue Orchard is as elegant and moving as it is exact and convincing. It is a dazzling portrayal of the changes America underwent in the first fifty years of the twentieth century. Readers will be swept into a time period that in many ways mirrors our own. Verna Krone\u2019s story is ultimately a story of the indomitable nature of the human spirit\u2014and a reminder that determination and self-education can defy the deforming pressures that keep women and other disenfranchised groups down.",

        "Description": "An all-access pass to America's first (and favorite) reality television program -- boasting over ten million viewers each week -- Antiques Roadshow!   If you're a fan of PBS's top-rated Antiques Roadshow, you've probably wondered -- what would it take to get your family treasure on the program? What happens to the antiques after the show airs? Are the appraisers ever wrong? And will Antiques Roadshow come to my hometown?   In this four-color, fully illustrated guide to America's favorite treasure-hunting program, Antiques Roadshow Behind the Scenes reveals inside information about the participants, the appraisers, the fans, and the antiques that make up the show, direct from the woman who makes it all happen -- executive producer Marsha Bemko. Learn what it really takes to put on a Roadshow event (and why certain cities are more likely to get a visit from the show than others), who gets chosen to be on air (and what items producers are really looking for), what it takes to be an appraiser (and how even the experts make mistakes) ... and what happens when things go terribly wrong (such as the occasional antique that turns out to have been stolen!). In addition, learn which books, websites, and resources your favorite appraisers recommend, and get updates on some of the most popular and notorious items ever featured on the show.   From priceless tips to the juicy family secrets hidden in dusty heirlooms, Antiques Roadshow Behind the Scenes is both an invaluable resource and a fascinating slice of Americana.",

        "Description": "Now in paperback, the memoir of a woman who tackles the mess she\u2019s made of her life by turning it over to a stack of women\u2019s glossies.Cathy Alter\u2019s Up for Renewal has captured the public\u2019s imagination, from Cathy\u2019s appearances on the Today show and her numerous write-ups in publications such as The New York Observer, The Atlantic, and Allure. Now in paperback, Up for Renewal is just right for beach-readers eager to hear the laugh-out-loud story of how one woman turned her life around by following the simple wisdom found in women\u2019s magazines. By age thirty-seven, with a failed marriage under her belt, Alter was continuing down the path of poor decisions, one paved with a steady stream of junk food, unpaid bills, questionable friends, and highly inappropriate men. So she dedicated her life to the women\u2019s magazines for the next year, resolving to follow their advice without question. By the end of her subscriptions, she would get rid of upper-arm jiggle, crawl out of debt, host the perfect dinner party, run a mile without puking, engage in better bathtub booty, ask for a raise, and overhaul her apartment. At least that was the premise of her social experiment. What actually happened was much less about cosmetic change and much more about internal transformation. Singular in its voice and yet completely universal, Up for Renewal appeals to all who have ever wondered if they could actually make their life over.",
