Now, in Beach Music, he tells of the dark memories that haunt generations, in a story that spans South Carolina and Rome and reaches back into the unutterable terrors of the Holocaust.Beach Music is about Jack McCall, an American living in Rome with his young daughter, trying to find peace after the recent trauma of his wife's suicide. But his solitude is disturbed by the appearance of his sister-in-law, who begs him to return home, and of two school friends asking for his help in tracking down another classmate who went underground as a Vietnam protester and never resurfaced. These requests launch Jack on a journey that encompasses the past and the present in both Europe and the American South, and that leads him to shocking--and ultimately liberating--truths.Told with deep feeling and trademark Conroy humor, Beach Music is powerful and compulsively readable. It is another masterpiece in the legendary list of classics that his body of work has already become.PAT CONROY is the author of five previous books: The Boo, The Water Is Wide, The Great Santini, The Lords of Discipline, and The Prince of Tides, the last four of which were made into feature films.",

        "Description": "Eight years ago, Dr. Thomas J. Stanley swept aside the mythical magic curtain of wealth to reveal The Millionaire Next Door. America found out just who and how common the truly wealthy were in this country\u00bfand we learned the characteristics and habits that made them so. Now the author of the follow-up The Millionaire Mind focuses on one of the least understood but increasingly rich demographics: Millionaire Women Next Door.\u00bfWhy write another book that profiles millionaires?\u00bf Stanley asks. \u00bfThe vast majority of the millionaire respondents (92 percent) in The Millionaire Next Door were men. . . . I felt that it was indeed time for successful businesswomen of the self-made variety to be heard.\u00bf And heard they are in this book that is destined to become every bit as informative, quoted, and inspirational as the author\u00bfs earlier works. Readers everywhere will be fascinated by Stanley\u00bfs thoroughly researched findings and conclusions. More than a simple extension of his studies of male millionaires, Millionaire Women Next Door presents groundbreaking concepts involving the nature, lifestyle, and business choices of successful American women that reach far beyond the scope of the author\u00bfs previous studies. The book examines the choice of businesses elected by self-employed women, ranking over 150 categories in terms of their profitability and probability of success. It also describes the women\u00bfs background, highlighting the fact that most millionaire women were raised in nurturing family environments that were literally training grounds for success, instilling the values that make this group one of the most generous in American society as demonstrated by its level of giving to charities, family, and friends. While many characteristics such as frugality and simplicity of lifestyle are similar to those of their male counterparts, Stanley demonstrates that most millionaire women work harder and do better\u00bfat school, in business, and in investment practices. Millionaire Women is sure to be one of the most read, reviewed, and discussed books to come out this year. Make your own wise investment for a wealth of solid sales.",

        "Authors": "By Surowiecki, James",
        "Description": "\u201cNo one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.\u201d\u00a0 \u2014H. L. Mencken\u00a0H. L. Mencken was wrong.In this endlessly fascinating book, New Yorker columnist James Surowiecki explores a deceptively simple idea that has profound implications:\u00a0large groups of people are smarter than an elite few, no matter how brilliant\u2014better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future.This seemingly counterintuitive notion has endless and major ramifications for how businesses operate, how knowledge is advanced, how economies are (or should be) organized and how we live our daily lives. With seemingly boundless erudition and in delightfully clear prose, Surowiecki ranges across fields as diverse as popular culture, psychology, ant biology, economic behaviorism, artificial intelligence, military history and political theory to show just how this principle operates in the real world.\u00a0 Despite the sophistication of his arguments, Surowiecki presents them in a wonderfully entertaining manner. The examples he uses are all down-to-earth, surprising, and fun to ponder. Why is the line in which you\u2019re standing always the longest? Why is it that you can buy a screw anywhere in the world and it will fit a bolt bought ten-thousand miles away? Why is network television so awful?

        "Description": "There is a vast literature on death and dying, but there are few reliable accounts of the ways in which we die. The intimate account of how various diseases take away life, offered in How We Die, is not meant to prompt horror or terror but to demythologize the process of dying to help us rid ourselves of that fear of the terra incognita.Though the avenues of death - AIDS, cancer, heart attack, Alzheimer's, accident, and stroke - are common, each of us will die in a way different from any that has gone before. Each one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show during our lives. Behind each death is a story.In How We Die, Sherwin B. Nuland, a surgeon and teacher of medicine, tells some stories of dying that reveal not only why someone dies but how. He offers a portrait of the experience of dying that makes clear the choices that can be made to allow each of us his or her own death.",

Romantic thoughts receive a particularly rich treatment; extensive selections on the subject of love include quotes from the plays (\"The course of true love never did run smooth\"; \"Speak low if you speak love\") and sonnets (\"For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings,/ That then I scorn to change my state with kings\").

        "Authors": "By Major, John",
        "Description": "John Major's autobiography is one of the most personal and revealing ever written by a former British Prime Minister.  Eagerly awaited, the remarkable story of his life, from an extraordinary childhood to becoming an influential leader at the forefront of global politics and subsequent fall, is candid, scrupulous, and unsparing.With complete candor and compelling insight, Major describes how he left school at fifteen, was unemployed, and through hard work and determination was elected to Parliament as a member of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party, which would transform Britain.Quickly becoming one of Thatcher's Cabinet members, he served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Foreign Secretary, and then Chancellor of the Exchequer, the powerful position from which he vaulted to Prime Minister in 1990 when, after Thatcher fell, he fought and won a shrewd campaign to succeed her.Major vividly recounts his role in shaping some of the most profound world events, including conferring with George Bush on the Gulf War, making the most decisive steps in a generation toward peace in Northern Ireland, leading Britain through the formation of the European Upon, and calling a general election in 1992 in which his party won the most votes in British political history.  Yet within months of the 1992 election his government was in troubled waters, and Major is candid about his difficulties and losses and the controversies and divisions within his own party.  Through it all, including the landslide defeat of his Conservative Party on May 1, 1997, and his immediate stepping down as party leader and Prime Minister, John Major acted with a dignity rare in politics.As he talks about his leadership triumphs and defeats and his work with a diverse range of inter-national figures including George Bush, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, Helmut Kohl, and Nelson Mandela, he offers invaluable insight into how political power is exercised both in the United Kingdom and abroad.  Here is a fascinating story of a man, his passion for politics, and the genuine and significant contributions he has made to the lives ofthe British and people around the world.",

An anthology used in Tennessee schools changed \u201cBy God!\u201d to \u201cBy gum!\u201d and \u201cMy God!\u201d to \u201cYou don\u2019t mean it.\u201d  The New York State Education Department omitted mentioning Jews in an Isaac Bashevis Singer story about prewar Poland, or blacks in Annie Dillard\u2019s memoir of growing up in a racially mixed town. California rejected a reading book because The Little Engine That Could was male. Diane Ravitch maintains that America\u2019s students are compelled to read insipid texts that have been censored and bowdlerized, issued by publishers who willingly cut controversial material from their books\u2014a case of the bland leading the bland. The Language Police is the first full-scale expos\u00e9 of this cultural and educational scandal, written by a leading historian. It documents the existence of an elaborate and well-established protocol of beneficent censorship, quietly endorsed and implemented by test makers and textbook publishers, states, and the federal government. School boards and bias and sensitivity committees review, abridge, and modify texts to delete potentially offensive words, topics, and imagery. Publishers practice self-censorship to sell books in big states.  To what exactly do the censors object? A typical publisher\u2019s guideline advises that \u2022 Women cannot be depicted as caregivers or doinghousehold chores.\u2022 Men cannot be lawyers or doctors or plumbers. They must be nurturing helpmates.\u2022 Old people cannot be feeble or dependent; they must jog or repair the roof.\u2022 A story that is set in the mountains discriminates against students from flatlands.\u2022 Children cannot be shown as disobedient or in conflict with adults.\u2022 Cake cannot appear in a story because it is not nutritious.  The result of these revisions are\u2014no surprise!\u2014boring, inane texts about a cotton-candy world bearing no resemblance to what children can access with the click of a remote control or a computer mouse. Sadly, data show that these efforts to sanitize language do not advance learning or bolster test scores, the very reason given for banning allegedly insensitive words and topics. Ravitch offers a powerful political and economic analysis of the causes of censorship. She has practical and sensible solutions for ending it, which will improve the quality of books for students as well as liberating publishers, state boards of education, and schools from the grip of pressure groups. Passionate and polemical, The Language Police is a book for every educator, concerned parent, and engaged citizen.",

The book chosen by People magazine and \"The View\" as one of the top diet books of 2005. The book called \"The Canadian Miracle Diet\" by Woman's World magazine. The book that first popularized the glycemic index, and brought widespread attention to how dieting based on this index is the foundation for losing weight permanently without feeling hungry, counting calories, or jeopardizing your arteries. And the book that made dieting as simple as a traffic light: Green is go, yellow is proceed with caution, and red is stop. Backed by the science of the glycemic index, The G.I. Diet places every type of food into one of three color-coded categories: Green\u2014make these foods the centerpiece of your diet; Yellow\u2014eat occasionally, after you've achieved your ideal weight; and Red\u2014avoid. For example, quickly digested white bread, including bagels and rolls, causes blood sugar to spike and hunger to return quickly. It's \"red.\" Slowly digested stone-ground whole-wheat bread, which gives a much-longer feeling of satiety, is \"green.\" The diet is a cinch to stick to, truly healthful, and couldn't be easier to follow. Includes recipes, snack ideas, a shopping list, and tips for dining out.",

His enviable life could disappear into thin air should the blackmailer's evidence-proof of his affair with a young student-become public knowledge.So he hires Boston private investigator Carlotta Carlyle to track down the blackmailer and put a stop to the scheme.

First published in 1878, the novella brought American novelist Henry James (1843\u20131916), then living in London, his first international success. Like many of James' early works, it portrays a venturesome American girl in the treacherous waters of European society \u2014 a theme that would culminate in his 1881 masterpiece, The Portrait of a Lady.On the surface, Daisy Miller unfolds a simple story of a young American girl's willful yet innocent flirtation with a young Italian, and its unfortunate consequences. But throughout the narrative, James contrasts American customs and values with European manners and morals in a tale rich in psychological and social insight. A vivid portrayal of Americans abroad and a telling encounter between the values of the Old and New World, Daisy Miller is an ideal introduction to the work of one of America's greatest writers of fiction.",

But he is deeply admired for his stories as well, which perhaps even more pointedly reveal the extraordinary subtleties of his art.That art is nowhere more evident than in \"The Beast in the Jungle,\" regarded by many as James's greatest achievement in short fiction. It is a gripping portrait of a man alienated from life and love, haunted and obsessed by his fears. James's uncanny ability to communicate the inner lives of his characters is also richly evident in \"The Jolly Corner\" and \"The Altar of the Dead,\" two superbly crafted tales that explore the complex interlacings of loss, love, and the ever-present past in the lives of their protagonists.",

Mann's handling of these concerns in this story of a middle-aged German writer, torn by his passion for a Polish youth met on holiday in Venice, resulted in a work of great psychological intensity and tragic power. It is presented here in an excellent new translation with extensive commentary on many facets of the story.",

Lately, there has been a rash of books that purport to tell us what dogs are thinking, such as the bestselling What Dogs Are Thinking.  This is a book about a Jewish boy and his sled dogs -- also a couple of wolves, a parrot or two...and Pinkwater's uncle...and his father. Daniel Pinkwater, prodigious author of books for children, popular commentator on National Public Radio, and dog trainer to the stars, is unclear about what dogs are thinking. In fact, he appears to be completely baffled by them. He considers himself lucky that his dog does not foul the carpet, bite people, or run in traffic. Unlike every other dog book ever written, this one does not make the reader feel more stupid than the author.",
