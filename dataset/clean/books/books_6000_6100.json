Fate was a teenaged boy with rumpled clothes, a motorcycle, and a shocking but credible story: Geof was his biological father. The boy, David Mayer, wasn't looking for any emotional reunion, but he did have an agenda. His parents - and he was quick to make that point, that Geof was nothing to him - had died earlier in the year, a murder/suicide according to the Port Frederick police. The cops were wrong, David said, and Geof was a cop, and he owed it to David to prove that Ron Mayer had not killed his invalid wife, Judy, and then himself.David was too full of anger and resentment to be openly cooperative, but he was not above luring Geof and Jenny from the back of his motorcycle to carefully placed clues...including two bizarre videotaped confessions of \"sin,\" one by Judy Mayer, the other by Judy's previous, abusive husband.Ron Mayer's parents and brothers, still distraught with grief, saw no reason to dispute the police department's murder/suicide ruling. A tight-lipped clan, they all lived on the same street in Port Frederick's oldest, most stately neighborhood - light-years from the neat subdivision Ron and Judy had called home - and all but Ron's mother seemed united in the conviction that Ron had, tragically, consigned himself to hell.Then another murder was committed - a horrible, violent, cruel murder. Although the police had cleared David Mayer in the case of his parents' deaths, even Geof had to admit that the Port Frederick Police Department sometimes made mistakes. Now dead animals were turning up on Jenny's doorstep, strange graffiti was emblazoned on the high school's blackboards, and the foreboding Jenny felt when she first met David was turning into downright terror....",

An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle\u2019s Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family\u2019s unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above seventy degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it\u2019s easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the Gammy Bird (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph\u2014in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets. By the time of the spring storms Quoyle has learned how to gut cod, to escape from a pickle jar, and to tie a true lover\u2019s knot.",

How does setting shape character? Character shape setting? Which seems to have the upperhand? How is Zebulon County itself a major character in A Thousand Acres ? 2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of Ginny's narration? Is she able to maintain clarity and candor throughout her chronicling of events? What gets in the way? Is she as forthcoming in discussing herself as she is in discussing others? Why or why not? How would the novel differ if told from the perspective of Rose, Caroline, Jess, or Larry? 3. At the outset of the novel, Ginny confesses that retrospection has not revealed too much about the drama that unfolded when her father decided to hand over the farm to Rose and her and leave out Caroline. 'I've thought over every moment of that party time and time again, sifting for pointers, signals, ways of knowing how to do things differently from the way they got done,' says Ginny. 'There were no clues.' To what extent does the story that she then tells undermine this claim? What remains a mystery despite her scrutiny? 4. What are the most tragic elements of A Thousand Acres ? From what do they arise? Which of these elements are rooted in the exercise of an individual will, and which seem attributable to something beyond the scope of human volition? Where does the novel ultimately come down on the enduring fate-versus-will dilemma? 5. What do you see as Ms. Smiley's debt to Shakespeare's King Lear ? Where do the two works part ways? What provides A Thousand Acres a certain autonomy despite its borrowed plot and characters? 6. Which of the issues explored in A Thousand Acres are unique to rural life in America? Which resonate regardless of geography? What does the novel reveal about variations and consistencies in the so-called American character? 7. Passion appears in many guises in A Thousand Acres; discuss them.What seems to lie at the root of each? Which do the most damage? Why do some yield to a desire for authority, acreage, or another, while others resist such temptations? Is there greater freedom in following passion or in checking it? What does the novel teach us about the nature of passion, restraint, and indulgence? 8. The interior lives of Caroline as well as Larry remain relatively unexamined compared to those of Rose and Ginny, their spouses, and Jess. What is the dramatic and thematic significance of keeping these characters somewhat shadowy? 9. Contemplating her father's momentous decision, Ginny marvels at its apparent rashness. 'He decided to change his whole life on Wednesday!' she exclaims.'Objectively this is an absurdity.' Her remark points to the rich interplay between chance and well-laid plans that appears throughout A Thousand Acres. How does the deliberate and daily work of generations stand up against the vicissitudes of the natural world and the whims of human nature? What kind of solace and safety, if any, do seasonal chores and rituals provide? 10. Discuss the myriad ways that motherhood--and fatherhood-- are weighed in the novel. How does Ginny's ineluctable desire to give birth shape her view of her present and past? What meaning does she locate in the many surrogate-maternal roles she plays? In what ways is her mother's long absence a constant presence? 11. 'Our bond had a peculiar fertility that I was wise enough to appreciate, and also, perhaps, wise enough to appreciate in silence,' Ginny says. 'Rose wouldn't have stood for any sentimentality.' Reticence seems the norm among these characters, yet expression takes place.What are the wordless languages with which these people communicate to one another? What are the reach and limits of each? What are the perils and possibilities? 12. Is there a particular politics or ideology at work in A Thousand Acres ? What is it? Does construing the novel in terms of, say, feminism limit or enlarge it? What do you see as the novelist's responsibility vis-a-vis politics? Does this work fall closer to agenda or inquiry? 13. 'The first novel I ever knew was my family,' writes Ms. Smiley in an afterword to a collection of essays on family by contemporary American writers. 'We had every necessary element, from the wealth of incident both domestic and historical, to the large cast of characters.We had geographical sweep and the requisite, for an American novel, adven-ture in the West.' Discuss A Thousand Acres as a meditation on family. On what dark corners of its dynamic character does the novel shed light? How are the Cooks both anomalous and representative of American families? What explains their tragic dissolution? What could have prevented it? How does sexual abuse factor into the equation? 14. What are the benefits and drawbacks of presenting the novel as one long look back? 15. Ginny is stilled by the disturbing thought that her own 'endurance might be a pleasant fiction allowed [her] by others who've really faced facts.' Is it? Do you construe her story, i.e., the novel, as flight from a difficult reality or a means of confronting it? Why? 16. During a game of Monopoly, Jess describes Harold as someone who is 'cannier and smarter than he lets on,' then suggests that real freedom exists in 'the slippage between what he looks like and what he is.' Discuss how the relationship between appearance and reality defines the arc of the novel's action and the meaning and direction of its characters' lives. What kind of importance does Ms. Smiley assign this relationship? 17. In what reads like a muted epiphany, Ginny, after time in her garden, considers the constant weight and absence of her mother's death before realizing that one reaches a point where 'relief is good enough.' Do you read this remark as an expression of resignation or a spirited acceptance of true trial? Why? 18. In a candid conversation with Rose, Ginny voices her inability to understand her father's abuse of them, despite Rose's insistence that the matter is a simple case of 'I want, I take, I do.' Says Ginny, 'I can't believe it's that simple.' Rose's response: 'If you probe and probe and try to understand, it just holds you back.' What does this exchange reveal about the limitations of reason? About the possibility or impossibility of true catharsis? What options exist when the rational is exhausted? Is faith considered? If so, faith in what? 19. Ms. Smiley now regrets that her novel, like Shakespeare's Lear , precludes the possibility of forgiveness--of a love not limited to a selfish exchange. Do you share her regret? Why or why not?",

        "Description": "Whether you're the owner of our own small business, a middle manager in a mid-sized company, or the CEO of a multinational, this book can show you how to improve your profits and productivity. How?  By following the principles of The Deming Management Method.Middle- and top-echelon managers in particular will find Dr. Deming's method provocative and controversial.  He is for a total revamping of the way American managers manage.  Some of his pet peeves are: managers who manage by slogans or by setting quotas, managers who don't know what their jobs are and who can't define the responsibilities of the workers under them, managers who tend to blame workers, not realizing that workers want to take pride in their work.  Change, Dr. Deming beliees, starts at the top with an informed, quality-conscious management.  This book includes excellent advice on how to achieve that level of management expertise in the author's analysis of Dr. Deming's famous 14 Points for Managers and his Deadly diseases of management.  Dr. Deming's management techniques are all carefully explained in this detailed, step-by-step treatment of their major points and of their practical applications to everyday business life.A large portion of The Deming Management Method is devoted to practical applications of the method by some of American's most innovative firms, including Honeywell, AT&T and Campbell's Soup.",

On board are hundreds of refugees, some optimistic, many more desperate. Among them are a maid with a devastating secret, the bankrupt Lord Merridith, his wife and children, and a killer stalking the decks, hungry for the vengeance that will bring absolution.   This journey will see many lives end, others begin anew. Passionate loves are tenderly recalled, shirked responsibilities regretted too late, and profound relationships shockingly revealed. In this spellbinding tale of tragedy and mercy, love and healing, the farther the ship sails toward the Promised Land, the more her passengers seem moored to a past that will never let them go.

Bush and his top national security advisers, after the initial shock of the September 11 attacks, led the nation to war.  Extensive quotations from the secret deliberations of the National Security Council -- and firsthand revelations of the private thoughts, concerns and fears of the president and his war cabinet -- make Bush at War an unprecedented chronicle of a modern presidency in time of grave crisis.  Based on interviews with more than a hundred sources and four hours of exclusive interviews with the president, Bush at War reveals Bush's sweeping, almost grandiose, vision for remaking the world. \"I'm not a textbook player, I'm a gut player,\" the president said.  Woodward's virtual wiretap into the White House Situation Room reveals a stunning group portrait of an untested president and his advisers, three of whom might themselves have made it to the presidency.  Vice President Dick Cheney, taciturn but hard-line, always pressing for more urgency in Afghanistan and toward Iraq.  Secretary of State Colin Powell, the cautious diplomat and loyal soldier, tasked with building an international coalition in an administration prone to unilateralism.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the brainy agitator and media star who led the military through Afghanistan and, he hopes, through Iraq.  National security adviser Condoleezza Rice, the ever-present troubleshooter who surprisingly emerges as perhaps the president's most important adviser.  Bush at War includes a vivid portrait of CIA director George Tenet, ready and eager for covert action against terrorists in Afghanistan and worldwide. It follows a CIA paramilitary team leader on a covert mission inside Afghanistan to pay off assets and buy friends with millions in U.S. currency carried in giant suitcases.

        "Description": "When Eugenie Davies is killed by a driver on a quiet London street, her death is clearly no accident. Someone struck her with a car and then deliberately ran over her body before driving off, leaving nothing behind but questions. What brought Eugenie Davies to London on a rainy autumn night? Why was she carrying the name of the man who found her body? Who among the many acquaintances in her complicated and tragic life could have wanted her dead? And could her murder have some connection to a twenty-eight-year-old musical wunderkind, a virtuoso violinist who several months earlier suddenly and inexplicably lost the ability to play a single note?For Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley, whose own domestic life is about to change radically, these questions are only the first in an investigation that leads him to walk a fine line between personal loyalty and professional honor. Assigned to the case by his superior, Superintendent Malcolm Webberly, Lynley learns that Webberly's first murder investigation as a DI over twenty years ago involved Eugenie Davies and a sensational criminal trial. Yet what is truly damaging is what Webberly already knows and no doubt wants Lynley to keep concealed.Now the pressure is on Lynley to find Eugenie Davies' killer. For not only is he putting his own career into jeopardy, but he is also attempting to safeguard the careers of his longtime partners Barbara Havers and Winston Nkata. Together, they must untangle the dark secrets and darker passions of a family whose history conceals the truth behind a horrific crime.",

This is one of that rare breed--a story of bizarre achievement and singular love.A hundred and fifty years ago, a young Englishman founded a private raj on the coast of Borneo. The world that resulted, boasting stone quays, great swaths of lawn, three Christian churches, and musical levees, eventually encompassed a territory the size of England, its campaigns paid for in human heads.It is the story of Victorian social mores superimposed on one of the most violent cultures on earth, of pockets of terness amid extreme brutality, and of a remarkable tribe of fugitives, missionaries, and romantics drawn to this remote outpost of the world.The deeper story resides in the realm of the heart. It is about love in absurd conditions, the tenacity of it as well as our ability to miss it repeatedly and with perverse genius. In the end, it is about love enduring when nothing else is left.",

Now, in her stunning new novel, she tells the story of a painter who transformed Renaissance Italy with the beauty of her work. The Passion of Artemisia chronicles the extraordinary life of Artemisia Gentileschi, the first woman to make a significant contribution to art history.  At age eighteen, Artemisia Gentileschi finds herself humiliated in papal court for publicly accusing the man who raped her-Agostino Tassi, her painting teacher. When even her father does not stand up for her, she knows she cannot stay in Rome and begs to have a marriage arranged for her. Her new husband, an artist named Pietro Stiatessi, takes her to his native Florence, where her talent for painting blossoms and she becomes the first woman to be elected to the Accademia dell'Arte. But marriage clashes with Artemisia's newfound fame as a painter, and she begins a lifelong search to reconcile painting and motherhood, passion and genius.  Set against the glorious backdrops of Rome, Florence, and Genoa, peopled with historical characters such as Cosimo de' Medici and Galileo and filled with the details of the life of a Renaissance painter, The Passion of Artemisia is the story of Gentileschi's struggle to find love, forgiveness, and wholeness through her art. At once a dramatic tale of love and a moving father-daughter story, it is the portrait of an astonishing woman that will captivate lovers of Gentileschi's paintings and anyone interested in the life of a woman who ignored the conventions of her day and dared to follow her heart.",

        "Description": "Charles A. Lindbergh astounded the world on May 21, 1927, with his successful solo flight from New York to Paris inThe Spirit of St. Louis. Upon his return to the United States, he received an unprecedented welcome and was regarded as a hero to a generation of Americans who looked to the skies as a field of promise and progress. Lindbergh has been the subject of scrutiny and controversy ever since.Reflecting America's faith in technological advancement, Lindbergh saw The Spirit of St. Louis as \"a lens focused on the future, a forerunner of mechanisms that would conquer time and space.\" This youthful optimism was later tempered by personal tragedy-the kidnapping and murder of his first-born son-and by the threat of American involvement in a war abroad. But Lindbergh confronted these challenges, often at odds with his supporters, with the same daring and boldness of character that inspired him to undertake his fabled flight.In Lindbergh: Flight's Enigmatic Hero, Von Hardesty, curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, takes another look at Lindbergh's life and offers new insights into the man and the myths that surrounded him. Drawing from a variety of sources, he reveals how Lindbergh, though stubborn and absolutist in many ways, evolved in his outlook and world view. With hundreds of full-color images and illustrations taken from a rich variety of private and public collections, Hardesty has produced a visually stunning and fascinating biography of one of the most important figures of the twentieth century.Published in Conjunction with the 75th Anniversary of Lindbergh's Historic Transatlantic FlightMore than 250 photographs, illustrations, and mapsNever-before-published images and artifacts from Lindbergh archives and private collectionsEight-page gatefold illustrationDetailed map of Lindbergh's fabled flightIllustrated timelines from Lindbergh's life\"Life is like a landscape.

        "Description": "This overall course in modern Chinese was designed by the Faculty of Peking University and has been used successfully for the past decade in teaching English-speaking and other foreign students basic Mandarin Chinese. Assuming no previous training in Chinese, this course is excellent for self-study, with full explanations and ample pronunciation and grammar drills throughout.The 30 lessons of the Peking University course are a self-contained grammar, beginning with the most basic characteristic of the language. The diligent student, who carefully follows the lessons to the end, will learn an extensive vocabulary (including characters) and will be conversant in the simple Chinese of daily life \u2026 progressing to such complex constructions as \"On Saturday I borrowed a translated novel from a friend, and on Sunday (in one day) I read the whole novel\" \u2014 which he will be able to say and to read.The first four lessons, summarized in table form in the fifth, introduce the vowels, consonants, compound vowels, and vowels plus nasal consonants and their phonetics \u2014 all the speech sounds of the Peking dialect \u2014 and gradually build up to the tonality and simple sentences of modern Chinese. Grammatical instruction progresses from elementary principles like the negative and interrogative to more advanced concepts like the perfective aspect. To enlarge vocabulary, lists of new words introduce each lesson, and to ensure written proficiency, instruction in writing characters is given at each lesson end.Adapted from the Introduction and first thirty lessons of the Modern Chinese Reader (Peking, 1963), the present course includes translations of the grammar example sentences and exercise sentences (none existed in the original). The official transcription of Mainland China is used, and a conversion table to the Yale and Wade systems is provided.",

A conflicted Catholic and amateur linguist, Ursula Codwell has a passion for saints and semantics that is surpassed only by the affection she feels for her husband, her children, and her precious bulldog. Raised in what she refers to as the \"fraught and schizoid tradition of Belgian Catholicism,\" Ursula suffers from neuroses that threaten to overwhelm her children and her ostensibly tolerant Unitarian husband. Her indecisiveness and attention to detail lead her to become fixated on matters such as reclaiming her surgically removed tissue from the lab or deciding what to wear to see the pope when he visits her hometown in New  York's Hudson Valley. In ten interconnected stories-all narrated by Ursula- What to  Wear to See the Pope tells the highly entertaining story of a strained but loving family.",

        "Title": "Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives",
        "Authors": "By Schlessinger, Laura",
        "Description": "Dr. Laura Schlessinger is the incredibly popular and controversial psychotherapist who hosts a nationally syndicated, top-rated midday radio talk show. She has strong convictions and doesn&#39;t hesitate to voice them to callers. She urges women emphatically to lose a domineering jerk of a lover and pick one of the \"good guys,\" to stay home and parent the babies they&#39;ve made, and to follow the dream rather than some dreamboat. Above all, she exhorts women not to blame anybody or anything but themselves if they&#39;re unhappy and their lives seem a mess.  10 Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives uses real-world examples from Schlessinger&#39;s radio show and private practice to drive the message home. And the message is that our reticence to be bold and brave often makes us act like stupid, submissive victims. Once we muster the courage to take responsibility for our own problems and to tolerate the discomforts of risk, the possibilities for personal growth and joy are limitless.  If you&#39;re looking for an all-approving hand to hold, you won&#39;t find it here. If you&#39;re prepared to take a clear-eyed look at your self-diminishing behavior and to make the move to a quality existence, there&#39;s no one better than Schlessinger to keep you honest and to cheer you on. One thing&#39;s for sure: You&#39;ll never look at your relationships, behaviors and decisions the same way after you&#39;ve finished reading this book.",

Set in the crazed, nationalistic Tokyo of late 1941, December 6 explores the coming world war through the other end of history's prism -- a prism held here by an unforgettable rogue and lover, Harry Niles.  In many ways, Niles should be as American as apple pie: raised by missionary parents, taught to respect his elders and be an honorable and upright Christian citizen dreaming of the good life on the sun-blessed shores of California. But Niles is also Japanese: reared in the aesthetics of Shinto and educated in the dance halls and backroom poker gatherings of Tokyo's shady underworld to steal, trick and run for his life. As a gaijin, a foreigner --especially one with a gift for the artful scam -- he draws suspicion and disfavor from Japanese police. This potent mixture of stiff tradition and intrigue -- not to mention his brazen love affair with a Japanese mistress who would rather kill Harry than lose him -- fills Harry's final days in Tokyo with suspense and fear. Who is he really working for? Is he a spy? For America? For the emperor?  Now, on the eve of Pearl Harbor, Harry himself must decide where his true allegiances lie.  Suspenseful, exciting and replete with the detailed research Martin Cruz Smith brings to all his novels, December 6 is a triumph of imagination, history and storytelling melded into a magnificent whole.",

Wexford rather despairs of the project; his more sanguine wife, Dora, is active on a committee to save the threatened land. Others are more desperate to achieve their end, and their means include the taking of hostages, including Dora, and the threat to begin murdering them.How Wexford and his dedicated team of police officers race against time to learn the identity of the kidnappers and discover the whereabouts of the hostages will rivet readers who delight in following the intricate details of an intensive police investigation. But, as in every Ruth Rendell novel, the mortal drama raises political and moral questions that are not resolved with the closing of the case, and that apply far beyond the limits of Kingsmarkham.",
