        "Description": "What a kick! American kids are crazy for karate. One of the fastest-growing kids' sports in the country, karate is taught to 2.5 million boys and girls in over 17,000 licensed karate schools, and the enrollment is increasing 20% a year. Now comes the first-ever book-and-belt set that teaches all the right moves for beginning and intermediate students. Written by Michael J. Dunphy, a sixth-degree black belt and USA Karate Federation hall-of-famer, The Kids' Karate Book features clear, safe, basic instruction in karate and tae kwon do. Here are the stances, the blocks, the punches -- including backfist, hammerfist, swordhand, and ridgehand. And the kicks -- front kick, side kick, flying kick, hook, wheel, and axe. There are breathing exercises, drills, even a section on the four \"c's\" -- courage, commitment, courtesy, and confidence. Black-and-white, step-by-step photographs clearly break down each move and are shot by Joe Smithberger, a photographer and black belt, using real karate students as models.Included with the book is a classic white cotton beginner's belt -- an obi to loop around the waist twice. Put it on and begin to feel not just the power, but the grace, discipline, fitness, and, irrepressible enthusiasm of karate kids.",

        "Description": "In the United States, 20 percent of the adult population is marginally literate. Of these roughly 30 million people, approximately 1.8 million are enrolled in basic skills literacy programs. Webster's New World has created a dictionary that is uniquely designed to help these beginning readers.Webster's New World Basic Dictionary of American English defines 49,000 of the most commonly used words in the American English lexicon. These are the words adult readers are most likely to encounter in newspapers and magazines, on job applications and product instructions, on advertising billboards and their children's school progress reports. The dictionary defines these words in clear, easy-to-understand language, using only words that are themselves defined in the dictionary, but never condescending to the adult reader. Definitions are liberally supplemented with example phrases and sentences that put words in context and help new readers understand meaning and usage. Special notes on synonyms help new readers differentiate between words with similar meanings. And selected illustrations help readers identify and remember words.This quality paperback book is designed for ease of reading and use, as well as for durability. Primarily created for native English speakers, it is also a valuable reference for more advanced readers of English as a second language. From the editors of the prestigious Webster's New World College Dictionary, the Basic Dictionary of American English brings the full scholarship behind that work to this important new offering in the field of literacy.",

        "Title": "The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account of Wrongful Executions",
        "Authors": "By Prejean, Helen",
        "Description": "Sister Helen Prejean was a little-known Roman Catholic nun from Louisiana when in 1993, her first book Dead Man Walking, challenged the way we look at the death penalty in America. It became a #1 New York Times bestseller and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Now in The Death of Innocents, she takes us to the new moral edge of the debate on capital punishment: What if we\u2019re killing the wrong man?Dobie Gillis Williams, an indigent black man from rural Louisiana with an IQ of 65, was accused of a brutal rape and murder. Williams\u2019s inept defense counsel, later disbarred for unethical practice for unrelated cases, allowed the prosecution\u2019s incredibly contrived scenario of the crime to go unchallenged. Less than two years after Williams\u2019s execution in January 1999, the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional to kill a man so mentally disabled.In 1986, Joseph Roger O\u2019Dell was convicted of murder in Virginia despite highly circumstantial evidence from a jailhouse snitch. For twelve years, O\u2019Dell sought DNA testing on the forensic evidence, which he claimed would exonerate him, but the courts refused. After his execution on July 23, 1997, the state destroyed the evidence. As a result, its conviction of O\u2019Dell could never be scrutinized. \u201cThe reader of this book will be the first \u2018jury\u2019 with access to all the evidence the trial juries never saw,\u201d says Prejean, who accompanied both men to their executions. By using the withheld evidence to reconstruct the crimes for which these two men were convicted, Prejean shows how race, prosecutorial ambition, poverty, election cycles, and publicity play far too great a role in determining who dies and who lives.Prejean traces the historical underpinnings of executions in this country, demonstrating that it is no accident that over 80 percent of executions in the past twenty-five years have been carried out in the former slave states. She also raises profound constitutional questions about an appeals system that decides most death cases on procedural grounds without ever examining their merits.To date, 113 wrongfully convicted persons have been freed from death row. If constitutional protections\u2013due process, assistance of counsel, and equal justice under law\u2013are truly being respected, how is it possible that these people were convicted in the first place? And how can we accept a system so rife with error?Sister Helen Prejean takes us with her on her spiritual journey as she accompanies two possibly innocent human beings to their deaths at the hands of the state. Prejean implores us to reflect on what is perhaps the core moral issue of the death penalty debate: Honorable people disagree about the justice of executing the guilty, but can anyone argue about the injustice of executing the innocent?",

A Short History of World War II is essentially a military history, but it reaches from the peace settlements of World War I to the drastically altered postwar world of the late 1940's. Lucidly written and eminently readable, it is factual and accurate enough to satisfy professional historians. A Short History of World War II will appeal equally to the general reader, the veteran who fought in the War, and the student interested in understanding the contemporary political world.",

These are just a few of the questions about yourself that you can answer with What Type Am I?

Here is information about individual strengths and weaknesses along with suggestions for personal growth and awareness. Whether you are a duty seeker or an action seeker, a knowledge seeker or an ideal seeker, What Type Am I is insightful, helpful, encouraging, and an eminently useful step in helping you appreciate your strengths and apply them to work, love, and life.",
