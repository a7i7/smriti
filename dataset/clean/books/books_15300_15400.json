        "Authors": "By Andreasen, Dan (ILT) and Clay, Julie (EDT)",
        "Description": "Twelve of the biggest stars of country music -- Vince Gill, George Jones, Brenda Lee, Patty Loveless, Loretta Lynn, Tim McGraw, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, LeAnn Rimes, Marty Stuart, Pam Tillis, and Trisha Yearwood -- shared childhood memories and dreams with Julie Clay, who delights us with their stories. The stories they tell are as emotionally rich as the songs they sing.  From the poignancy of Brenda Lee's relationship with her father to the comedy of Trisha Yearwood's early attempts at stardom, this is the book for families to read together, again and again. Each of the tales is followed by biographical information highlighting the artist's career and the background of the story. Dan Andreasen's richly painted illustrations, steeped in American tradition yet sparklingly new, perfectly complement the warmth and humor of these memorable stories.",

        "Description": "William Tobias Merrick, an energetic young man from the provinces, travels to the big city in a time of great optimism and ferment, hoping to make his mark on a frenzied, money-crazed society obsessed with the promise of new technologies. The city in question is London in the 1690s, but it is also New York in the 1990s. The new technologies are diving bells, pneumatic winches, and \"sucking worm\" drainage engines; but they are also wireless telecommunication devices, patented biotechnology processes, and revolutionary electronic Internet routers. Only the sense of unlimited possibility remains the same throughout.In his new novel, Gary Krist does something unique in the history of fiction: tell the exact same story with the same set of characters in two separate times and settings, in language appropriate to each. Unfolding simultaneously in two distant - but remarkably similar - periods of history, Extravagance is a comic picaresque novel of financial mania, the story of a world gripped by a terminal case of irrational exuberance.",

It saw the surrender of Vicksburg and the retreat of General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia after a crushing defeat at Gettysburg. In interweaving the narratives of these two storied battles, Duane Schultz has presented a compelling blow-by-blow account of what is arguably the most pivotal point of the entire conflict. All the players are brought to life here, whether it is Lincoln agonizing in the telegraph office while he waits for news from Generals Grant and Meade, General Pete Longstreet trying to cajole Lee into revising his plan of attack, or the women of the towns of Vicksburg and Gettysburg coming under fire and tending to the legions of wounded. We see a nation in the midst of its greatest convulsion, and we see that, while the \"Glorious Fourth\" dashed the greatest hopes of the Confederacy, the war was far from over. 25 b/w illustrations, 2 maps.",

Convinced that he knows who killed her--and determined to hide the truth--Jack decides to make it look as though he did it.  Staging the crime scene so that the evidence incriminates him, he then calls the police. And to hammer the final nail in his own coffin, he hires the most inexperienced lawyer he can find, a reluctant rookie by the name of Mary DiNunzio, employed at the hot Philadelphia firm of Rosato & Associates.Unfortunately for Jack, hiring Mary may turn out to be his only mistake.Though inexperienced, Mary doubts Jack's confession and begins to investigate the crime. She finds that instead of having a guilty client who is falsely proclaiming his innocence, she has an innocent client who is falsely proclaiming his guilt. Her ethics and instincts tell her she can't defend a man who wants only one thing--to convict himself. Or can she? Smarter, gutsier, and more determined than she has any right to be, Mary decides to stick with the case. With help from the most unexpected sources, she sets out to prove what really happened--because as any lawyer knows, a case is never as simple as it seems.And nothing is ever certain until the final moment of truth.",

        "Description": "In Hazardous Duty - a real life, nonfiction thriller set in the ruins of Bosnia and the sands of Saudi Arabia, the deadly alleys of Mogadishu and the teeming streets of Port-au-Prince - Colonel David Hackworth completes a second tour of battlefield duty, this time as a war correspondent. In his hard-hitting, inimitable style, he tells of the sacrifices of ordinary grunts in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Korea, and Haiti, and offers a tough-love critique of American military leadership, explaining America's role in new post-Cold War conflicts.Colonel David H. Hackworth is America's most decorated living soldier, with more than one hundred awards, including two Distinguished Service Crosses, nine Silver Stars, eight Bronze Stars for valor, and eight Purple Hearts, which he considers the most meaningful because, he says, \"they can't be faked.\" More than any other military commentator, he has the trust and confidence of the millions of soldiers - from foreign armies as well as our own - who cheered every word of his widely acclaimed autobiography.A wake-up call for military reform, Hazardous Duty pulls no punches in calling America's top political and military leaders to account for selling out duty, honor, and country. Colonel Hackworth returns from America's new battlefields to report that the Pentagon is wasting billions of dollars. He offers no-nonsense solutions for streamlining the military services and rationalizing their missions to confront the new face of war.",

Have you ever been briefly out of touch with your mother only to find she's phoned everyone short of the National Guard to track you down -- or, just maybe, are you that mother?Take comfort in knowing you're not alone, as Amy Borkowsky shares more than a decade's worth of maddening phone messages from her hilariously overprotective mom. Based on the hit CD of the same name, Amy's Answering Machine features actual messages in which Amy's mom warns her not to wear a red bathrobe because a friend's grandson \"said that red is a gang color\"...advises her not to get a cat because \"what if you finally found a nice guy and he was allergic?\"...cautions her not to wear crepe-soled shoes because \"they were just saying on the news that if you're ever in a plane crash, crepe is no good if you have to go down the slide.\"Amy also reveals the stories behind the messages and shares calls not available on CD, each one brimming with the worry and annoying comments only a loving mother could dish out.The same warnings and suggestions that had Amy cringing are sure to have you doubled over with laughter. But before you turn the page, take some advice from Amy's mom: Make sure you have plenty of reading light, because squinting causes crow's feet.",

        "Title": "Correcting the Code: Inventing the Genetic Cure for the Human Body",
        "Authors": "By Thompson, Larry",
        "Description": "When Dr. French Anderson, researcher and physician at the National Institutes of Health, assembled the team that injected a young girl from the suburbs of Cleveland with a special solution of white blood cells, he ushered in a brave new world of science and medicine. Those cells were genetically altered - or corrected - to produce a critical enzyme necessary to create a fully functioning immune system, which his young patient was born without. The age of human gene therapy had arrived. Along with it will come the molecular cures for cancers and heretofore incurable conditions such as cystic fibrosis, perhaps even AIDS.Correcting the Code is the eminently readable and remarkable story of the handful of doctors and researchers who deeply believed they could break one of the last barriers in medicine: repairing human genes that cause illnesses. Even before Watson and Crick successfully modeled DNA, the idea of changing the genetic composition of humans had long been a scientific Holy Grail - despite the stain of eugenics and the public phobia of genetic engineering gone amok. Over the last twenty years, as the pace of research has accelerated, laboratories have entered a sort of race to claim the final breakthrough, to be the first to successfully treat a human patient. The story of that frenzied research contains the great scientific upheavals in the field of biology, including a new understanding of how specific molecules interact to compose living cells that make up the human body.This is the riveting account of how a great scientific puzzle - finding a way to repair actual human molecules - was solved, of the intellectual and political milieu in which it occurred, and of the remarkable people who committed their lives to the task - Anderson, Michael Blaese, Ken Culver, Richard Mulligan, and others.Author Larry Thompson makes the seemingly indecipherable world of genetic science understandable to the general reader. Furthermore, he unravels a dramatic story of inspired invention, frustrating dead ends, the clash of egos, the fits and starts of innovation that reveal how science is conducted in the real world.",

As radically feminist as\u00a0\u00a0Our Bodies, Ourselves was in its day,\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Northrup's guide cites dramatic and affecting\u00a0\u00a0cases of women healing from long-term illnesses\u00a0\u00a0through alternative medical methods, and gives\u00a0\u00a0groundbreaking mind-body guidance.

The fossil record is a gigantic embarrassment and \"headache\" for evolution? Darwin's theories are based ultimately on philosophy, not on science?Brace yourself for a scientific earthquake! Strange \"tremors\" are now coming from science labs. As researchers uncover new levels of astonishing complexity within the cell, they suddenly face a shocking conclusion: Darwin was wrong. This sophisticated complexity could not arise by change; it must have been designed.Darwinism Under the Microscope probes the exciting \"Darwinism vs. Design\" debate that is making headlines. It lays a scientific foundation for \"divine design\" and equips the reader to discuss the topic intelligently...even with professors!One of the book's contributing authors, biologist Michael Behe, has done revolutionary work on the cell's tiny molecular machines. His \"evidence of design\" in Darwin's Black Box triggered an ever-expanding global controversy. Using Darwin's own pass-fail test, Behe concludes:\"Darwin's theory has absolutely broken down.\"Darwinism Under the Microscope explains the \"breakdown\" and provides the knowledge and skill to share this breaking news with the next generation.",

Writing poems and keeping journals since childhood, Jewel has been searching for truth and meaning, turning to her words to record, to discover, and to reflect.  In A Night Without Armor, her first collection of poetry, Jewel explores the fire of first love, the lessons of betrayal, and the healing of intimacy. She delves into matters of the home, the comfort of family, the beauty of Alaska, and the dislocation of divorce.

        "Description": "He was The Intimidator. A nightmare in the rear-view mirror. A unique winner in the boardroom. A seven-time Winston Cup champion. A driver whose personal success story and dedication inspired the adoration of millions of fans.  Then on February 18, 2001, just seconds from the Daytona 500 finish line, the world of stock-car racing suffered a devastating loss as Dale Earnhardt fatally careened into a track wall.  The tragic shock waves, and an unprecedented outpouring of respect and love, have not stopped since.At the Altar of Speed takes readers behind the scenes of Earnhardt's celebrated life, tracing his rags-to-riches journey to the top of America's fastest-growing sport.  Beginning with Earnhardt's early days growing up in small-town North Carolina, veteran sports writer Leigh Montville examines how a ninth-grade dropout started on the dusty dirt tracks of the South, went through two marriages and a string of no-future jobs before turning twenty-five, then took about a million left turns to glory.  Through the pitfalls and triumphs, Earnhardt would ultimately become a celebrated champion, whose lifetime earnings would top forty-one million dollars.  The son of a legendary racer, the father of a NASCAR star, he lived a total auto-racing life filled with triumph and sadness, great joy and great pain.Transporting readers to the colorful, noisy world of stock-car racing, where powerful engines allow drivers to reach speeds of 200 m.p.h., At the Altar of Speed vividly captures the man who drove the black No. 3 car, a man whose determination and inner strength left behind a legacy of greatness that has redefined his sport.  Illustrated with a section of full-color photographs, At the Altar of Speed is a tribute to both the man and his unbeatable spirit.",

        "Authors": "By Grizzard, Lewis",
        "Description": "This is a book about a miracle.There's just no other way to describe what happened.When Lewis Grizzard went in for his latest heart surgery - a replacement for his much-publicized pig valve - he assumed it would be another ordinary, humdrum hospital nightmare. He'd been through plenty of those. Little did he dream that, while on the operating table, his heart would stop. And stop dead in its tracks - the key word here being \"dead.\" For Lewis Grizzard was, in fact, as good as gone. His ticker didn't work for three days. He was in a coma for weeks. His doctors said his chances of survival were nil. He even saw the glowing white light at the end of the tunnel. For most people, that would be a sign that heaven was just around the corner. For Lewis - just his luck - it turned out to be a K mart tire sale.I Took a Lickin' and Kept on Tickin' (And Now I Believe in Miracles) is the extraordinary journey that took America's most popular humorist all the way from Russia (Lewis would have us believe he'd rather go through another heart operation than use Russian toilet paper again) to the Den of the Bloodsuckers (otherwise known to most normal people as hospital orderlies) to the very brink of death - and back again. In great detail - ranging from horrendous and painful to hilarious and heartwarming - we see, close up, what it's like to come as near as a man can come to dying.Lewis would rather not make such a journey again, but even he must admit it was a trip worth taking, for, at death's door, he learned all the lessons he'll ever need about life. He now knows how precious life is to him. He knows how important other people are to him. And he learned just how much other people care about him - while in the hospital, he received over fifty thousand letters from those who were praying for his survival.I Took a Lickin' and Kept on Tickin' is a tale filled with great humor, some tragedy, a whole lot of faith, and, most of all, a great deal of important truths. About love. About values and priorities. About the Great Georgia Bulldog in the Sky. It's about change and it's about staying the same. It is a book unlike any Lewis Grizzard has ever written - and it's one he hopes he never has to write again.All in all, it's definitely safe to say that, above all, it's a miracle.",

Alone - until he meets Grace and Izzie Zorn, twin sisters who, although biologically identical, are utterly different. Thrown off by the irresistible attraction of this astonishing pair, Nat's moral compass starts to fail him. How could it not, as he enters a seductive new world of private Caribbean islands, personal jets, and endless possibility? A world where folly, even crime, now seems right.When classes resume, Nat and the twins fall under the influence of a charismatic philosophy professor with dangerous ideas and a secret of his own. His teachings will be used to justify a bold scheme, plotted deep beneath the school in the lair of a forgotten social club, banished for almost a century.",

On the long journey from her family's Kansas ranch through the hard early days in Greenwich Village, she's learned about the craft of photography, the art of music, the depths of passion, and the many faces of love. Through grit, luck, and soulful talent, she's made her dreams come true - until the nightmare begins.Danger enters her life, and Catherine is haunted by vivid dreams and poignant memories. Her lover seems more of a sexual release than a solace; her trusted friend, the agent of a hot new group, the Newborns, is struggling to make them number one; her former shrink still torments her psyche; her new assistant gets into serious trouble; and the lead singer of the Newborns is deep into white powder, heading toward destruction. Catherine turns for support to her dearest friend, Julia Clearwater, a beautiful singer and semi-retired rock icon whose wildly sensual paintings are the latest rage in SoHo. For Catherine, the menace and suspense intensify until the novel's dramatic conclusion.",

George is a TV producer for the upstart network MBC, launching a truly and weirdly groundbreaking new show that blurs the lines between fact and fiction. Lizzie is a software entrepreneur dealing with the breakneck pleasures and pains of running her own company in an industry where the rules are rewritten daily.However, after Lizzie, recovering from a Microsoft deal gone awry, becomes a confidante and advisor to George's boss, billionaire media mogul Harold Mose, the couple discovers that no amount of sophisticated spin can obscure basic instincts: envy, greed, suspicion, sexual temptation - and, maybe, love. When they and their children are finally drawn into a thrilling, high-tech corporate hoax that sends Wall Street reeling (and makes one person very, very rich), George and Lizzie can only marvel at life's oversized surprises and hold on for dear life.",
