        "Description": "The old rules of decorating are dead, says style maker and TV personality Christy Ferer. Whether we've wanted to or not, we've staged a revolution -- a revolution in taste and in the way we live. In today's homes, anything goes, and we're all the happier for it.  In this exuberant and groundbreaking book, we discover what works and what happens to the way we live when all the rules are broken. Today we find that the dining room, once a place of fine linens and formal dinner parties, has become an office, a rec room, a space families live in every day. It's still beautiful, but who cares if the chairs match? Life has changed and, like everything else, the old rules sometimes just don't make sense.  This revolution in taste has opened the door to a million new possibilities. But where do we start? In Breaking the Rules, style whiz Christy Ferer shakes up the old assumptions and provides us with fabulous tips about:   COLOR -- Common wisdom tells us to stick to neutrals for major areas and let brighter colors serve as accents, but Ferer shows us how green, blue, and even pink work as the new neutrals.  PATTERN -- Plaids with florals, checks with stripes? Heresy! Not so, says Ferer, who proclaims that patterns mix well when their colors are the same intensity.  SCALE -- We've all heard that in a small room we should keep the furniture small. But here, we see that oversize pieces can expand our perception of space.  FUNCTION -- The dining room for dining, the library for reading, the maid's room for the maid...whose house is that?  Every space serves multiple functions today, Ferer points out. If a dining room unfolds its cabinets to become a home office/media room, so much the better.  FURNITURE -- The bedroom suite and the matching Colonial living room are things of the past. Today, nothing needs to match -- and it's more interesting if it doesn't. An eighteenth-century sofa is only enhanced next to a 1960s coffee table.  This inspiring book illuminates these and other ideas with more than 140 extraordinary color photographs that take us into the living quarters of some exceptionally creative people, among them Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Bette Midler, Bill Blass, and Cynthia Rowley. In Breaking the Rules, Christy Ferer brings together fabulous ideas and a feast of dazzling photos as she walks us through the brave new world we've made for ourselves -- and shows us how much fun a revolution can be.

A prickly sharp-witted sleuth transplanted from Boston, Claire enthusiastically pursues puzzles like the source of brown rot on peaches and ruinous mold on almonds in lush central California - when she's not practicing her secret talent for snooping into murder.Alpine hulsea, a yellow dandelion-like flower, doesn't grow in the citrus groves and vineyards of the San Joaquin Valley. It belongs in the High Sierra - only it's found on the body of the unidentified corpse Claire Sharples stumbles upon in a local drainage ditch. Claire knows death is no stranger to the fields and farms of California's agri-business. Tempers run short in the local cantinas. Migrant laborers make fatal mistakes when they toil for seventy hours a week. Then, too, some common pesticides used all too often here have a lethal dose of three or four drops.But when Claire's dead man is added alongside the bodies of two Mexican nationals also found drowned in this water-scarce region, one realizes the rash of \"accidents\" may be more than a tragic coincidence.Urbane, former M.I.T. scholar Claire can't resist her natural inclination to find out as much as any can about the victims and how they died. The more questions she asks, the more she feels like a stranger in a strange land amid the Stetson-wearing growers and agri-businessmen. Unfortunately, she felt the same way at her lover Sam Cooper's house, now that his two baseball-playing sons are spending a month with their dad.Soon Claire is running into trouble with both nature and nurture as her personal relationship starts wilting and her investigation uproots some dangerous secrets. Her instincts, honed sharp by her scientific training, are telling her to watch out for little white lies and some big black ones. And a woman's gut emotions are warning her about passions that run deep and dark through the valley ... and the yellow wildflower that may lead to catching a killer or to her own dusty death.",

        "Title": "Diamonds Are Forever: The Business of Baseball",
        "Authors": "By Sommers, Paul M. (EDT)",
        "Description": "As every American knows, our nation's favorite pastime is also big business. The last fifteen years have been exceptionally good to the business of baseball-with the growth in fan attendance, the spread of cable television, the burgeoning interest in cards and other baseball memorabilia, the historical appreciation of franchise values, the emergence of a powerful players' union, and average salaries that are almost twenty times their pre-1976 levels.  Yet at this time of prosperity, major economic issues trouble the sport: the threat of franchise relocation, the continual flash points in collective bargaining, the growing commercialization of the game, the club owners' collusive response to free agency, lingering concerns of race discrimination, and the arguably tenuous link between player pay and performance.  This fascinating book examines these and other major issues and assesses their probable impact on the business of baseball. Contributors begin by examining the effect of the reserve clause on competitive league balance. They then investigate whether prior experience with the salary arbitration process affects player demands in subsequent settlements and compare salary differences between ineligible and arbitration-eligible players. They consider the role of the baseball fan as contributor to team winning, as season ticket purchase, and as card-collecting hobbyist.  Diamonds Are Forever also looks at the link between player pay and performance. The authors question whether such high salaries are actually earned by players or are instead awarded by owners eager to have \"the winning team.\" They also discuss the growth in unequal distribution of salaries among players. In the last section, the authors look at racial discrimination in baseball and the influence of a team's racial composition on salaries.  From Babe Ruth to Nolan Ryan, Doubleday to Skydome, baseball cards to Homer Hankies, the nation has been enthralled for decades with the business of baseball. Although the authors look to the future and consider changes that might occur in this profitable pastime, they assure that diamonds are forever.",

Throughout, the focus remains on communion with our natural surroundings and the peace it brings, on sanctuary from the noise and frantic pace of every day, on the sounds of nature and the gentle art of doing nothing. Each restful and rejuvenating interior illustrates how such relaxing spaces can be created in the home, with details such as an intricate stonework fireplace, a panoramic view through a wall of picture windows, or a tropical poolside cabana. Beautiful color photographs make Haven an escape unto itselfas well as a rich source of ideas and inspiration for making dreams of simplicity and retreat come true.",

        "Title": "Learning XML",
        "Authors": "By Ray, Erik T.",
        "Description": "The arrival of support for XML--the Extensible Markup Language--in browsers and authoring tools has followed a long period of intense hype. Major databases, authoring tools (including Microsoft's Office 2000), and browsers are committed to XML support. Many content creators and programmers for the Web and other media are left wondering, \"What can XML and its associated standards really do for me?\" Getting the most from XML requires being able to tag and transform XML documents so they can be processed by web browsers, databases, mobile phones, printers, XML processors, voice response systems, and LDAP directories, just to name a few targets.In Learning XML, the author explains XML and its capabilities succinctly and professionally, with references to real-life projects and other cogent examples. Learning XML shows the purpose of XML markup itself, the CSS and XSL styling languages, and the XLink and XPointer specifications for creating rich link structures.The basic advantages of XML over HTML are that XML lets a web designer define tags that are meaningful for the particular documents or database output to be used, and that it enforces an unambiguous structure that supports error-checking. XML supports enhanced styling and linking standards (allowing, for instance, simultaneous linking to the same document in multiple languages) and a range of new applications.For writers producing XML documents, this book demystifies files and the process of creating them with the appropriate structure and format. Designers will learn what parts of XML are most helpful to their team and will get started on creating Document Type Definitions. For programmers, the book makes syntax and structures clear  It also discusses the stylesheets needed for viewing documents in the next generation of browsers, databases, and other devices.",

        "Authors": "By Hoff, Ron",
        "Description": "\"I can see you naked\" - visualizing audiences in the buff, as a counter to nervousness - has been taught by presentation experts for years. In this revised edition of \"I Can See You Naked\" - a delightful guide to presentations of all kinds - Ron Hoff begins by dismissing the technique. \"Never talk to a naked audience,\" is his advice. It's too distracting.\"I Can See You Naked\" is the first book on making presentations that doesn't read like a textbook. The first book to sound like a presentation, look like a presentation, and \"play\" like a presentation. It is, in fact, a funny, irreverent, entertaining, and highly effective presentation on presentations. And it is a publishing success story - the first edition went back to press seven times and sold well over 100,000 copies. It has been a selection of sixteen book clubs.After four years of success, \"I Can See You Naked\" is now even better. This fearless new edition of the national bestseller on making great presentations has been extensively revised by author Ron Hoff, making it 25 percent larger than the first edition. It features 16 emphatic new chapters, new illustrations by Barrie Maguire, new photographs, new sidebars and panels, new nuggets to treasure, and scores of ideas ready for use in your next presentation. Why a revised edition? Because a lot has happened to presentations in four years. New to this edition are dynamic new chapters including \"The Deadly Game\" - how to win competitive presentations; Stand or sit? What's a presenter to do?; \"How do you create excitement if you're not Madonna, Prince, or Zig Ziglar?\"; \"Great props don't have to be proper\"; How to make a speech in a strange hotel; Questions that often float through the minds of audiences; Ten points to pin to the wall before your next one-on-one and a guide to \"relationships\" - the hot, new word in making presentations.Packed with insightful case studies, and personal anecdotes, \"I Can See You Naked\" clearly and succinctly addresses all your presentation needs. It covers virtually every major concern, providing hundreds of proven techniques, confidence builders, and keen insights that can help you make your presentations more effective. In short, with punchy chapters and sprightly illustrations, this indispensable book tells the reader everything from how to warm up an audience to how to read faces.This book is a jubilant guide to your next presentation - and a reassuring source of confidence as you get ready for the big day.",

        "Description": "Vance Randolph has long been an undeniable presence on the American folklore scholarship scene. His Ozark corpus is \"the best known single body of regional folklore in the United States,\" according to Richard Dorson, director of the Folklore Institute at Indiana University. And Gershon Legman, the world&#39;s leading scholar of sexual and scatological humor, has called Randolph \"the greatest and most successful field collector and regional folklorist that America ever had.\" In Legman&#39;s estimation, \"We have no one else like him. He is a national treasure, like Mark Twain. Randolph&#39;s reputation rests on the massive accumulation of folksong, folktale, and ballad materials he collected during forty years of living and working in the Ozarks. Unfortunately, in the 1950s when Randolph published several collection of Ozark tales, the material in this volume was considered unprintable.Pissing in the Snow departs from the academic prudery that until recently has restricted the amount of bawdy folklore available for study. It presents a body of material that for twenty years has circulated only in manuscript or microfilm under its present title. When placed in their rightful context alongside Randolph&#39;s other collections of folk material, the bawdy tales help provide evidence of what Ozark hill people think about their own lives and language. As Rayna Green writes in her introduction, \"The entire body of material . . . offers a picture of expressive behavior unparalleled by any other American region&#39;s or group&#39;s study.\" Hoffmann&#39;s annotations draw parallels between the erotic narrative tradition of the Ozarks and that in other parts of the country and the world, especially Europe.",

        "Authors": "By Zimmermann, Warren and Mahaney (EDT)",
        "Description": "Warren Zimmermann was the last United States ambassador to Yugoslavia. Origins of a Catastrophe is his highly personal, authoritative account of a doomed country's descent into war and genocide. His book answers the questions millions have asked: What happened? Why did it happen? And what does it have to do with us?This is a story of villains. Challenging conventional wisdom, Zimmermann shows that the wars in Yugoslavia, culminating in the slaughter in Bosnia, sprang not from ancient blood lusts but from the conscious actions of extremist leaders like Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. The deformities in the character and policies of these and other ethnic supremacists come alive in their own words, recounted from the author's in-depth discussions with them.This is also the story of people who resisted the racist propaganda of their leaders. Origins of a Catastrophe paints a vivid picture of political leaders and ordinary citizens who fought for democratic reform and human rights.In Yugoslavia the Bush and Clinton administrations failed the first test of American leadership since the end of the cold war. In his insider's account of that failure, Zimmermann contends that, if the NATO air strikes of 1995 had been launched three years earlier, they would have saved over 100,000 lives and produced a better peace agreement than was achieved at Dayton.Origins of a Catastrophe draws lessons far beyond the confines of the wars that ravaged the Balkans. The issues fought out with such savagery in Yugoslavia - how to curb tyrannical majorities and protect endangered minorities, when to recognize claims of self-determination, when and how to use force - are being contested around a globe beset by racial tension and violence. Warren Zimmermann's powerful and passionate narrative demonstrates that separation is no solution to the rivalries between ethnic groups - that people can live in peace only when they learn to live together in tolerance.",
