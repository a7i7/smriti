Teeming with high-quality color graphics, each custom designed page helps you accomplish specific tasks -- everything from Web browsing to watching videos. Written by New York Times columnist and Missing Manual series creator David Pogue, this book shows you how to get the most out of your new Apple iPhone.The name iPhone may be doing Apple a disservice. This machine is so packed with possibilities that the cellphone may actually be the least interesting part. The iPhone is at least three products merged into one: a phone, a wide-screen iPod and a wireless, touch-screen Internet communicator. The iPhone's beauty alone may be enough for you to dig for your credit cards, but its Mac OS X-based software makes it not so much a smartphone as something out of the film \"Minority Report.\"The real magic, however, awaits when you browse the Web. You get to see the entire Web page on the iPhone's screen. All of this is cooked up with Apple's traditional secret sauce of simplicity, intelligence and whimsy.Written by New York Times columnist and Missing Manual series creator David Pogue, iPhone: The Missing Manual shows you everything they need to know to get the most out of your new Apple iPhone. Full of humor, tips, tricks, and surprises, this book teaches you how to extend iPhone's usefulness by exploiting its links to the Web as well as its connection to Macs or PCs; how to save money using Internet-based messages instead of phone calls; and how to fill the iPhone with TV shows and DVDs for free.",

Our publisher readily agreed, and so you\u2019ll see that this year\u2019s edition is far more eclectic in form than previous editions. Along the way to making the book, we also came across a variety of things that didn\u2019t fit neatly anywhere, but which we felt should be included, so we conceived the front section, which is a loose Best American roundup of notable words and sentences from 2005.

The caller on the Virginia safe house's secure line confirms that an investigative reporter working for Castillo's European newspapers - and snooping after German and Russian thieves involved in the Iraqi Oil-for-Food scandal - has been brutally murdered in Marburg.Next comes the call from the director of National Intelligence, who asks if Castillo knows anything about the Kuhls - an Austrian couple serving as Central Intelligence Agency deep-cover assets since World War II - who were just found dead in a Vienna park, strangled by stainless steel garrotes.And within hours Castillo learns of two assassination attempts on Christmas Eve: U.S. Secret Service Special Agent Jack Britton and his wife in Philadelphia and Gendarmeria Nacional Comandante Liam Duffy and his wife and children in Buenos Aires. All narrowly escaped automatic weapons fire from assailants unknown - unknown except for the fact that the hits were professional.As Castillo shares the news with his group of troubleshooters in the innocuously-named Office of Organizational Analysis - a menacing mix of military and former CIA, FBI, Secret Service and other agents - two conclusions are immediately reached.One: These are no coincidences - this is payback. Two: Delta Force Lieutenant Colonel C.G. Castillo likely is the next target.Operating the OOA under a Top Secret Presidential Finding and reporting only to the President of the United States, Castillo has made more than a few enemies, both foreign and domestic. Confiscating some sixty million illicit dollars and leaving a trail of dead bad guys top the list of reasons why.Still, it's the question of \"Who?\" that has everyone watching their backs. South American drug lords angry that Castillo's helicopters destroyed their manufacturing plant during his clandestine rescue of a DEA agent?Muslim extremists wanting revenge for Castillo finding and stealing back the explosives-filled 727 aircraft that the terrorists were going to crash into the Liberty Bell?Ex-members of AVH and Stasi - former Hungarian and East German secret police - ruthless professionals infamous for their use of garrotes?As Castillo and his operatives try to connect the dots, two Russian SVR rezidents turn his world upside down. They want to defect - but to Castillo, not the CIA, which already is bragging it bagged the pair. And being top-level foreign intelligence service officers, they bear him great gifts ... including what they claim is Russian intel about who's making weapons of mass destruction and where. There's more than one big surprise in all this for Presidential Agent C.G. Castillo ... if he can stay alive.",

That process begins with overcoming and forgiving feelings of fear&#151an emotion that acts as an internal obstacle to wealth.

        "Title": "Ethel Merman: A Life",
        "Authors": "By Kellow, Brian",
        "Description": "More than twenty years after her death, Ethel Merman continues to set the standard for American musical theater. Every actress who dares step into one of her roles is inevitably held up for comparison with the original (and usually found wanting); every new theater-filling voice is measured against her sheer sonic marvel; every interpreter of the Cole Porter canon must take account of the singer who the awestruck songwriter said sounded \"like a band going by.\" Those who witnessed her onstage remember her as the greatest performer they'd ever seen; the rest of us make do with the original cast recordings, the handful of films she made, and the apparently endless trove of anecdotes about this famously strong-willed, fearsomely blunt, and terrifyingly exacting woman.We know, in short, the legend, but who, really, was Ethel Agnes Zimmermann? Brian Kellow's superb biography is the first account of her life to examine both the artist and the woman with as much critical rigor as empathy. The result is the fullest portrait yet of this show-business phenomenon. We follow Ethel from her childhood in Astoria, Queens, and her first jobs as a crack secretary, to her earliest singing engagements in nightclubs and vaudeville, to her star-making performance of \"I Got Rhythm\" in the Gershwins' Girl Crazy. For the next thirty years she conquered Broadway with her astonishing voice, immaculate enunciation, and near-faultless pitch, all employed in an unmatched series of successes, from Anything Goes to the spectacular Annie Get Your Gun. And finally, there was Gypsy - Merman was a canny enough professional to recognize immediately not only that the show had an outstanding book and score but also that Rose was the role of a lifetime. What she did with that role, of course, was to make every kind of history that matters.Kellow adds immeasurably to our understanding of Merman by examining her in the context of the dramatic changes that Broadway underwent from the 1930s through the 1960s, but more significantly by stripping away the accumulation of years of rumors and apocryphal stories to uncover the surprisingly fragile woman behind the often overbearing star. Through dozens of interviews with her colleagues, friends, and family members, Kellow reveals many surprising facets of Merman: her bitterness at Hollywood's neglect of her, her generosity toward younger performers, her poignant determination to keep her career alive long after the Broadway she knew disappeared, and her indomitable, and ultimately frustrated, search for love.",

(Booklist)Dewey's story starts in the worst possible way. On the coldest night of the year in Spencer, Iowa, at only a few weeks old--a critical age for kittens--he was stuffed into the return book slot of the Spencer Public Library. He was found the next morning by library director Vicki Myron, a single mother who had survived the loss of her family farm, a breast cancer scare, and an alcoholic husband. Dewey won her heart, and the hearts of the staff, by pulling himself up and hobbling on frostbitten feet to nudge each of them in a gesture of thanks and love. For the next nineteen years, he never stopped charming the people of Spencer with his enthusiasm, warmth, humility (for a cat), and, above all, his sixth sense about who needed him most. As his fame grew from town to town, then state to state and finally, amazingly, worldwide, Dewey became more than just a friend; he became a source of pride for an extraordinary Heartland farming community slowly working its way back from the greatest crisis in its long history.",

Some have evolved uncanny likenesses to such elements of their environment as leaves and rocks. Others use color and shape in more spectacular displays simply to frighten a predator or to warn that they are poisonous. In turn, and to complicate matters for their enemies, some edible animals have evolved a striking likeness to poisonous animals that use color as a warning. Though such camouflage and mimicry is most widely and brilliantly evident among the insects\u2014where sometimes only the experienced naturalist can see through the deception\u2014it has also evolved in plants and several groups of vertebrates, including birds, snakes, and salamanders.Camouflage and Mimicry describes the remarkably varied attempts of species to deceive their predators and prey. It illustrates a group of strategies which help to increase an individual's chances of survival.",
