        "Description": "Berlin, between the two world wars. When an executive at the renowned Ufa film studios is found dead floating in his office bathtub, it falls to Nikolai Hoffner, a chief inspector in the Kriminalpolizei, to investigate. With the help of Fritz Lang (the German director) and Alby Pimm (leader of the most powerful crime syndicate in Berlin), Hoffner finds his case taking him beyond the world of film and into the far more treacherous landscape of Berlin\u2019s sex and drug trade, the rise of Hitler\u2019s Brownshirts (the SA), and the even more astonishing attempts by onetime monarchists to rearm a post-Versailles Germany. Being swept up in the case are Hoffner\u2019s new lover, an American talent agent for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and his two sons: Georg, who has dropped out of school to work at Ufa, and Sascha, his angry, older son, who, unknown to his father, has become fully entrenched in the new German Workers Party as the aide to its Berlin leader, Joseph Goebbels. What a spellbinding novel Shadow and Light is, and what a novelist Jonathan Rabb has become! When we last met Hoffner, it was 1919, and he had taken on the disappearance and death of Rosa Luxembourg in Rosa, a novel the critic John Leonard hailed as \u201ca ghostly noir that could have been conspired at by Raymond Chandler and Andr\u00e9 Malraux.\u201d Shadow and Light is equally brilliant and atmospheric, and even harder to put down or shake off. Like Joseph Kanon or Alan Furst, Rabb magically fuses a smart, energetic narrative with layers of fascinating, vividly documented history. The result is a stunning historical thriller, created by a writer to celebrate\u2014and contend with.",

        "Description": "Get ready for the read of your life. Never before has a single book combined awesome vans, unicorns, Billy Joel, and erotic fiction in such a potent combination. A writing tour de force? Perhaps. A reading experience that will sear itself into your consciousness like a red-hot branding iron? Without question.Comedian and basic cable superstar Michael Ian Black unleashes the full fury of his astonishing intellect in this collection of short comic essays. My Custom Van is a no-holds-barred assault to the funny bone that will literally beat you into submission with hilarity*.How did he do it? How did he create such a fine anthology? Answer: With love. Michael opened his heart and used the magical power of love to write more than fifty thought-provoking essays like, \"Why I Used a Day-Glo Magic Marker to Color My Dick Yellow,\" and \"An Open Letter to the Hair Stylist Who Somehow Convinced Me to Get a Perm When I Was in Sixth Grade.\"Maybe you think love is not a substitute for \"good writing skills\" and \"spell check.\" Bull pucky! When it comes to writing books, love is the most powerful word processor of all.Sounds pretty great, right? And yet...something is still holding you back from paying the full purchase price of this book. What is it? Perhaps you secretly believe you do not deserve a book this good. Nonsense -- you deserve this book and so much more. In fact, if Michael could have written you all the stars in the sky, that's what he would have done. But he couldn't do that, due to his lack of knowledge in the area of astronomy. So he wrote this book instead.And this flap copy.Enjoy.* Michael Ian Black is not responsible for any actual injuries caused by reading this book.",

What can we do to keep romance fresh? With marriages crumbling all around us, how can we cultivate an intimate relationship? Principles understood by previous generations often seem foreign to today\u2019s husbands and wives, yet they are the essential ingredients for building a close, long-term relationship in any age: \u2022 A home founded on Jesus Christ and the practice of persistent prayer \u2022 Unswerving commitment to one another \u2022 Mutual respect and trust \u2022 A sense of romance \u2022 Effective communication For the young couple just starting out or in the early years of marriage, 5 Essentials will combine a concise message of hope with practical tools for developing a thriving, intimate union, and more mature husbands and wives will discover a fresh look at marriage, pointing the way to renewed closeness and a fulfilling, lifelong love.When we said \u201cI do,\u201d did we really mean \u201ctill death do us part\u201d?   What can we do to keep our romance alive? With so many marriages ending in divorce, how can ours be different? How can we have a fulfilling relationship that goes the distance?  Dr. James Dobson, America \u2019s most trusted authority on marriage and family, equips you and your spouse to build a firm foundation for a love that endures the test of time.

        "Description": "A politically polarized America is coming together over a new kind of car\u2014the plug-in hybrid that will save drivers money, reduce pollution, and increase US security by reducing dependence on imported oil. Plug-in Hybrids points out that, where hydrogen fuel-cell cars won\u2019t be ready for decades, the technology for plug-in hybrids exists today. Unlike conventional hybrid cars that can\u2019t run without gasoline, plug-in hybrids use gasoline or cheaper, cleaner, domestic electricity\u2014or both. Although plug-in hybrids are not yet for sale, demand for them is widespread, coming from characters across the political spectrum, such as:  \u2022 Chelsea Sexton, the automotive insider: working for General Motors, Sexton fought attempts to destroy the all-electric EV1 car and describes how car companies are resisting plug-in hybrids\u2014and why they\u2019ll make them -anyway. \u2022 Felix Kramer and the tech squad: Kramer started a nonprofit organization using the Internet to tap into a small army of engineers who built the first plug-in Prius hybrids. \u2022 R. James Woolsey, former CIA director and national security hawk: seeing the end of oil supplies looming, Woolsey is demanding plug-in hybrids to wean us from petroleum. Cautioning that the oil and auto companies know how to undermine the success of plug-in car programs to protect their interests, the book gives readers tools to ensure that plug-in hybrids get to market\u2014and stay here.",

Machiavelli's classic book on statecraft, The Prince, published over 400 years ago, remains controversial to this day because of its electrifying frankness as a practical guide to power. Is it a how-to manual for dictators, a cynical philosophy of \"the end justifies the means\", or a more complex and subtle analysis of successful government?Machiavelli was a loyal servant of the Florentine Republic. His opposition to Medici despotism resulted in his torture on the rack and exile. Yet he chose as his model for the Prince the most notorious tyrant, Cesare Borgia. Introducing Machiavelli traces the colorful life of this paradoxical realist whose clear-sighted patriotism made him the first truly modern political scientist. Machiavelli is seen as central to the postmodern debate on Civil Society.",

All lessons have Spanish titles with English translations, followed by a brief passage written entirely in Spanish. Immediately following the short essay is a vocabulary list with English equivalents covering all key words in the essay. Brief exercises that follow cover grammar, more vocabulary, pronunciation, idioms, and cognates--words that are written alike in English and Spanish, but are pronounced differently.Written passages in English discuss various aspects of Spanish culture and history. Structured in a workbook format, with exercises to test comprehension of the subject matter, Painless Spanish is a language immersion course, but with this important difference: it immerses students gently and painlessly into the Spanish language.",
