        "Description": "Question: Who made us?Answer #1: God made us. Answer #2: Evolution made us.Which is it? What is the true answer to the age-old question of where we came from? Is it even possible to know for sure?  In Finding Darwin's God,  Kenneth R. Miller offers a surprising resolution to the evolutionism vs. creationism debate.A distinguished professor of biology at Brown University, Miller argues that the genuine world of science is far more interesting than either the scientific mainstream or its creationist critics have assumed.  He begins by systematically demolishing the claims of evolution's most vocal critics, showing that Darwin's great insights continue to be valid, even in the rarefied worlds of biochemistry and molecular biology.  As he puts it, evolution \"is the real thing, and so are we.\" Does this mean that evolution invalidates all worldviews that depend upon the spiritual? Does it demand logical agnosticism as the price of scientific consistency? And does it rigorously exclude belief in God? His answer, in each and every case, is a resounding No. Not, as he argues, because evolution is wrong.  Far from it.  The reason, as Miller shows, is that evolution is right. In this lively, fast-paced book, Miller offers a thoughtful, cutting-edge analysis of the key issues that seem to divide science and religion.  As his narrative shows, the difficulties that evolution presents for Western religions are more apparent than real.  Properly understood, evolution adds depth and meaning not only to a strictly scientific view of the world, but also to a spiritual one.  Miller's resolution of the issues that seem to divide God from evolution will serve as a guide to anyone interested in the classic questions of ultimate meaning and human origins.",

The rundown but charming country house of their older friend Henry Tillotson and the extravagant dinner party he has promised them seem the ideal surroundings. But none of the guests is prepared for the romantic drama that is about to unfold about them - and that will spin itself out over the next four decades.For before the drama is over, James and Matthew will discover that neither of their young women is quite as unworldly as she appeared to be. Barbara and Antonia will fall under the spell of Henry's wife, the eccentric Margaret, who, although voluntarily bedridden, wields an uncanny control over the husband she married years before under quite unorthodox circumstances.Most of all, the reader will have succumbed to the appeal of this effortlessly complex, tragicomic novel about love and its entrapments. Endowing it with the charm of a twentieth-century A Midsummer Night's Dream, Mary Wesley has created in A Dubious Legacy another of her glorious contemporary classic novels.",

Because she is at the fulcrum of a deadly political battle between conjurers in an alternate world where \"Roumania\" is a leading European power, Miranda was hidden by her aunt in our world, where she was adopted and raised in a quiet Massachusetts college town. The narrative is split between our world and the people in Roumania working to protect or to capture Miranda: her Aunt Aegypta Schenck versus the mad Baroness Ceaucescu in Bucharest, and the sinister alchemist, the Elector of Ratisbon, who holds her true mother prisoner in Germany. This is the story of how Miranda -- with her two best friends, Peter and Andromeda -- is brought back to her home reality. Each of them is changed in the process and all will have much to learn about their true identities and the strange world they find themselves in.This story is a triumph of contemporary fantasy.",

It was a milestone in the continuing history of indigenous resistance in the Americas, and an important development in the growing worldwide struggle against global policies of economic colonization.In this collection, writers from Mexico and the United States provide the background and context for the Zapatista movement, and explore its impact, in Mexico and beyond.\"Elaine Katzenberger has assembled an interesting and stimulating collection of voices from Mexico and the United States, of those in revolt and those reacting to the revolt. . . .\u00a0Listened to as moments of an ever wider and ever more multi-sided conversation, the voices in the book should contribute to that amplification by giving their listeners a sense of the complexity and breath of the discussion.\" &#151; Harry Cleaver, Professor at University of TexasElaine Katzenberger is a publisher and Executive Director for City Lights Booksellers and Publishers.\u00a0Her edited works include fiction, non-fiction, and poetry.

        "Description": "\"A splendidly written, well selected and presented collection \u2026 I recommend the book unreservedly to all readers, in or out of professional mathematics, who like to 'follow the gleam' of numbers.\" \u2014 Martin Gardner.The theory of numbers is an ancient and fascinating branch of mathematics that plays an important role in modern computer theory. It is also a popular topic among amateur mathematicians (who have made many contributions to the field) because of its accessibility: it does not require advanced knowledge of higher mathematics.This delightful volume, by two well-known mathematicians, invited readers to join a challenging expedition into the mystery and magic of number theory. No special training is needed \u2014 just high school mathematics, a fondness for figures, and an inquisitive mind. Such a person will soon be absorbed and intrigued by the ideas and problems presented here.Beginning with familiar notions, the authors skillfully yet painlessly transport the reader to higher realms of mathematics, developing the necessary concepts along the way, so that complex subjects can be more easily understood. Included are thorough discussions of prime numbers, number patterns, irrationals and iterations, and calculating prodigies, among other topics.Much of the material presented is not to be found in other popular treatments of number theory. Moreover, there are many important proofs (presented with simple and elegant explanations) often lacking in similar volumes. In sum, Excursions in Number Theory offers a splendid compromise between highly technical treatments inaccessible to lay readers and popular books with too little substance. Its stimulating and challenging presentation of significant aspects of number theory may be read lightly for enjoyment or studied closely for an exhilarating mental challenge.",

        "Title": "Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror",
        "Authors": "By Scheuer, Michael",
        "Description": "Access a Comprehensive Bibliography Though U.S. leaders try to convince the world of their success in fighting al Qaeda, one member of the U.S. intelligence community would like to inform the public that we are, in fact, losing the war on terror. Further, until U.S. leaders recognize the errant path they have irresponsibly chosen, he says, our enemies will only grow stronger. According to the author Michael Scheuer, the greatest danger for Americans confronting the Islamist threat is to believe\u2014at the urging of U.S. leaders\u2014that Muslims attack us for what we are and what we think rather than for what we do.\u00a0Blustering political rhetoric \u201cinforms\u201d the public that the Islamists are offended by the Western world\u2019s democratic freedoms, civil liberties, inter-mingling of genders, and separation of church and state. However, although aspects of the modern world may offend conservative Muslims, no Islamist leader has fomented jihad to destroy participatory democracy, for example, the national association of credit unions, or coed universities. Instead, a growing segment of the Islamic world strenuously disapproves of specific U.S. policies and their attendant military, political, and economic implications. Capitalizing on growing anti-U.S. animosity, Osama bin Laden\u2019s genius lies not simply in calling for jihad, but in articulating a consistent and convincing case that Islam is under attack by America. Al Qaeda\u2019s public statements condemn America\u2019s protection of corrupt Muslim regimes, unqualified support for Israel, the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, and a further litany of real-world grievances. Bin Laden\u2019s supporters thus identify their problem and believe their solution lies in war. Scheuer contends they will go to any length, not to destroy our secular, democratic way of life, but to deter what they view as specific attacks on their lands, their communities, and their religion. Unless U.S. leaders recognize this fact and adjust their policies abroad accordingly, even moderate Muslims will join the bin Laden camp.",

In this age of globalism and high-speed travel, Seth Stevenson, the witty,   thoughtful Slate travel columnist, takes us back to a time when travel meant putting one foot in front of the   other, racing to make connections between trains and buses in remote transit stations, and wading through the   chaos that most long-haul travelers float 35,000 feet above. Stevenson winds his way around the world by biking,   walking, hiking, riding in rickshaws, freight ships, cruise ships, ancient ferries, buses, and the Trans-Siberian   Railway-but never gets on an airplane. He finds that from the ground, one sees the world anew-with a   deeper understanding of time, distance, and the vastness of the earth. In this sensational travelogue, each step of   the journey is an adventure, full of unexpected revelations in every new port, at every bend in the railroad tracks,   and around every street corner.

        "Title": "First Into Nagasaki: The Censored Eyewitness Dispatches on Post-Atomic Japan and Its Prisoners of War",
        "Authors": "By Cronkite, Walter (FRW) and Weller, Anthony (EDT)",
        "Description": "George Weller was a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning reporter who covered World War II across Europe, Africa, and Asia. At the war\u2019s end in September 1945, under General MacArthur\u2019s media blackout, correspondents were forbidden to enter both Nagasaki and Hiroshima. But instead of obediently staying with the press corps in northern Japan, Weller broke away. The intrepid newspaperman reached Nagasaki just weeks after the atomic bomb hit the city. Boldly presenting himself as a U.S. colonel to the Japanese military, Weller set out to explore the devastation.As Nagasaki\u2019s first outside observer, long before any American medical aid arrived, Weller witnessed the bomb\u2019s effects and wrote \u201cthe anatomy of radiated man.\u201d He interviewed doctors trying to cure those dying mysteriously from \u201cDisease X.\u201d He typed far into every night, sending his forbidden dispatches back to MacArthur\u2019s censors, assuming their importance would make them unstoppable. He was wrong: the U.S. government censored every word, and the dispatches vanished from history.Weller also became the first to enter the nearby Allied POW camps. From hundreds of prisoners he gathered accounts of watching the atomic explosions bring an end to years of torture and merciless labor in Japanese mines. Their dramatic testimonies sum up one of the least-known chapters of the war\u2014but those stories, too, were silenced.It is a powerful experience, more than 60 years later, to walk with Weller through the smoldering ruins of Nagasaki, or hear the sagas of prisoners who have just learned that their torment is over, and watch one of the era\u2019s most battle-experienced reporters trying to accurately and unsentimentally convey to the American people scenes unlike anything he\u2014or anyone else\u2014knew. Weller died in 2002, believing it all lost forever. Months later, his son found a fragile copy in a crate of moldy papers. This historic body of work has never been published.Along with reports from the brutal POW camps, a stirring saga of the worst of the Japanese \u201chellships\u201d which carried U.S. prisoners into murder and even cannibalism, and a trove of Weller\u2019s unseen photos, First into Nagasaki provides a moving, unparalleled look at the bomb that killed more than 70,000 people and ended WWII. Amid current disputes over the controlled embedding of journalists in war zones and a government\u2019s right to keep secrets, it reminds us how such courageous rogue reporting is still essential to learning the truth.",

        "Description": "Through their thoughtful and accurate balance of developmental, clinical-diagnostic, and experimental approaches to child and adolescent psychopathology, Eric Mash and David Wolfe's ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY remains the most authoritative, scholarly book in today's abnormal child psychology market. Appropriate for novice and expert alike, this book traces the developmental course of each disorder and shows how biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors interact with a child's environment.   Since one of the best ways to introduce students to a particular problem of childhood or adolescence is to first describe a real child, the authors begin each chapter with engaging first-person accounts and case histories of a child with a particular disorder. This child is then referred to throughout the entire chapter, illustrating the categorical and dimensional approaches used to describe disorders, as well as bringing life to the theories Mash and Wolfe present. Embracing today's world with leading-edge coverage of the DSM-IV-TR and dimensional approaches to classification, Mash and Wolfe's comprehensive introduction covers many topics: evidence-based assessment and treatment, contemporary research and cutting-edge theories related to the predominantly inattentive ADHD subtype, early-onset and the developmental propensity model of conduct disorder, the triple vulnerability model of anxiety, the tripartite model in children, depression, and autism.",

        "Description": "Eli Newberger, M.D., one of this country's most distinguished pediatricians and experts on family development, brings decades of experience and insight to this vitally important subject. The Men They Will Become delves to the deepest roots of male character. A baby boy, says the author, has traits but no character. At each stage, particular characteristics?attachment, honesty, self-control, sportsmanship, generosity, courage?are either nurtured or thwarted. Along the way, intrinsic biological drives combine with parenting as well as gender-polarizing forces in the culture to create either the admirable qualities we all admire or those we deplore and fear.Unlike recent writers on this subject, Newberger does not try to make boys more like girls. Instead he shows us how to nurture, encourage and celebrate the best in men. The need for leaders of bold but nonviolent character makes this profoundly insightful book of urgent and timely importance.",

        "Authors": "By Allen, Thomas B. and Polmar, Norman",
        "Description": "What would have happened if atomic bombs had not been dropped on Japan in August 1945? Distinguished military writer historians Thomas B. Allen and Norman Polmar answer that provocative question in Code-Name Downfall, a vivid and dramatic narrative of America's war in the Pacific, which would lead inevitably to massive amphibious assaults against the Japanese home islands. Based on newly declassified documents, personal interviews, and a decade of meticulous research, their book traces the progress of the Pacific War and reveals the top-secret details of the plans and preparations, on both the American and Japanese sides, for an invasion that would be far more complex - and costly in human lives - than the D-Day landings in France.Some historians have argued that the use of the atomic bomb was both unnecessary and immoral. Allen and Polmar totally refute that argument and back up their position with hard evidence. More than that, the authors describe the deep personal beliefs of the men who determined the course of the war, not only from the vantage point of history, but also in the context of that terrible time. In the end, with new knowledge and understanding of the events during these climactic days of the war, readers will be able to decide for themselves whether Truman's decision was justified.",
