Among them are the anarchist Michael Bakunin, who was to challenge Marx for the soul of the masses; Ivan Turgenev, author of some of the most enduring works in Russian literature; the brilliant, erratic young critic Vissarion Belinsky; and Alexander Herzen, a nobleman's son and the first self-proclaimed socialist in Russia, who becomes the main focus of this drama of politics, love, loss, and betrayal. In The Coast of Utopia, Stoppard presents an inspired examination of the struggle between romantic anarchy, utopian idealism, and practical reformation.",

Abortion a 'necessary evil.' And many kids are making these life-altering  decisions without the benefit of wise biblical counsel. They don't know their Creator  as Shepherd of their heart, and are dying because of it emotionally, spiritually,  and sometimes even physically. You can do something about it. Ron Hutchcraft  and Lisa Hutchcraft Whitmer recognize the urgent needs of our kids and know exactly  what will help them--a relationship with Jesus Christ. Take a look into the world  of today's teens. Relationships matter most to them. Music is their language. Sex  is expected...and confusing. They are very lonely, wounded, and lost. Sin is not  an issue for them, but the results of sin are. The Battle for a Generation  explains how to meet the needs of today's young people right where they live.",

        "Title": "A Love Like No Other: Stories from Adoptive Parents",
        "Authors": "By Kruger, Pamela (EDT) and Smolowe, Jill (EDT)",
        "Description": "Adoption now affects more American families than ever before-1.5 million adopted children live in the United States today, and 60 percent of Americans report some kind of personal connection to adoption. Happily, this surge has coincided with an increasing mainstream acceptance of adoption as just another way to form a family, complete with its own frustrations and joys that deserve to be discussed and celebrated.  A Love Like No Other does just that. It features twenty leading writers, all of whom are adoptive parents, discussing their personal experiences. They include adoptive parents of children of other races, like Emily Prager, who grapples with how to best keep her daughter connected to her Chinese roots; parents whose families blend biological children and adopted children, like bestselling author Jacquelyn Mitchard; single mothers of only children, like journalist Sheila Stainback; and same-sex adoptive parents like Jesse Green, who wonders how his sons will feel when instructed to make a Mother's Day card. They live in big cities and small towns, and have adopted domestically and overseas. Some of their stories soberingly address the potential complications of adoptive parenting, while others tell of happily enriched family lives.  Impressive for both its breadth and its quality, A Love Like No Other is a timely and heartwarming mosaic of the contemporary lives of adoptive parents and their children. In elegant prose and with refreshing honesty, these essays will introduce you to a group of families you won't soon forget.",

When someone steals the partridge from the pear tree and replaces it with a cryptic puzzle she has no hope of solving, it\u2019s almost more than the Puzzle Lady can bear. But then smug crossword creator Harvey Beerbaum solves the acrostic, and it turns out to be a poem promising the death of an actress. This is more like it! Could the threat be aimed at Cora and her thespian debut? Or at Sherry, one of the ladies-dancing? Or at Sherry\u2019s nemesis, the pageant\u2019s predatory lead, Becky Baldwin? Cora and Sherry barely have time for a mystery, what with trimming Christmas trees and buying Christmas presents, but rehearsals go on, under police protection--until a killer strikes elsewhere in a most unexpected manner.Ordinarily Cora Felton would be delighted to have two murders to solve. But this time she finds herself vying with a visiting Scotland Yard inspector who appears to have an all-too-personal stake in solving the crimes. Cora does too when her own niece becomes a prime suspect and the murderer strikes again. Is someone trying to shut down the Christmas pageant? Cora would be only too happy if that were the case, but she fears the secrets lie deeper. Now she is interviewing witnesses, breaking into motel rooms, finding evidence, planting evidence, and having a merry old time. In fact, she would be perfectly happy--if this wasn\u2019t turning out to be a Christmas to die for!",

Her mother, the beautiful Alia, taught her daughter the skills she needed to survive. A plastic smile. Saying yes. Burying in boxes in her mind the horrors she glimpsed around her. \"Learn to erase your memories,\" she instructed. \"He can read eyes.\" In this richly visual memoir, Salbi describes tyranny as she saw it - through the eyes of a privileged child, a rebellious teenager, a violated wife, and ultimately a public figure fighting to overcome the skill that once kept her alive: silence.  Between Two Worlds is a riveting quest for truth that deepens our understanding of the universal themes of power, fear, sexual subjugation, and the question one generation asks the one before it:  How could you have let this happen to us?",

        "Authors": "By Hybels, Bill and Wiersma, Ashley",
        "Description": "Building on the solid foundation laid in Becoming a Contagious Christian, Just Walk Across the Room signals the next era in personal evangelism. Pastor Bill Hybels\u2019s firm conviction is that the highest value in personal evangelism is being attuned to and cooperative with the promptings of the Holy Spirit. This means playing only the role you are intended to play\u2014walking when the Spirit says to walk, talking when the Spirit says to talk, and falling silent when the Spirit suggests that you\u2019ve already said enough. More than two thousand years ago, Jesus himself introduced the perfect model for evangelism. He left the marvelous adoration of the angels and the perfection of heaven, and he chose to \u201cwalk\u201d clear across the cosmos. He had no memorized script, no forced formulas. Instead, he was armed only with an offer of redemption to people just like you and me, many of whom were neck-deep in pain of their own making. Today, the goal for every Christian is to reflect Christ\u2019s love and follow his example by taking simple walks across rooms\u2014leaving our circles of comfort and extending hands of care, compassion, and inclusiveness to people living far from God. Hybels encourages Christ-followers to \u201clive in 3-D\u201d\u2014developing friendships, discovering stories, and discerning appropriate next steps\u2014as a means of learning to understand the Spirit\u2019s promptings. With fresh perspectives from his own reflections and experiences collected during his most recent decade of ministry. Hybels shows with undeniable clarity the power of this approach to evangelism. The stakes are high. The implications are eternal. And you may be only a conversation away from having unparalleled impact on someone\u2019s life\u2014if you will just walk across the room.",

Written in 1513 and published in 1532, after Machivelli\u2019s death, &&LI&&RThe Prince&&L/I&&R immediately provoked controversy that has continued unabated to this day. &&LBR&&R&&LBR&&RDefining human nature as inherently selfish, Machiavelli proposes that social conflict and violence are natural phenomena that help determine the ablest, most versatile form of government. Asserting that idealism has no place in the political arena, &&LI&&RThe Prince&&L/I&&R primarily addresses a monarch\u2019s difficulties in retaining authority. Considered the first expression of political realism, it has often been accused of advocating a political philosophy in which \u201cthe end justifies the means.\u201d Indeed the emphasis in &&LI&&RThe Prince&&L/I&&R on practical success, at the expense even of traditional moral values, earned Machiavelli a reputation for ruthlessness, deception, and cruelty.

But, at first, her parents despaired: Their beloved baby girl emerged drastically deformed, without arms and with only one fully formed leg and foot, the other leg markedly shorter and mis\u00adshapen. Yet, Lena's parents were not to be daunted. Their love for their daughter knew no bounds. Lena's father's response when he saw his daughter for the first time was, \"Arms or no arms, she will need a home anyway.\" Thus, with compassion and abiding love but never pity, the Johanssons raised the remarkable girl who is today Lena Maria Klingvall, a woman of indomitable spirit and unshakable faith.Fueled by her parents' unceasing confidence in her, Lena learned to use her feet to do all kinds of things, from basic self-care, to playing keyboards and driving a car. From early on, Lena refused \"special\" status, preferring instead to learn how to accomplish things her own way. In her own words, \"I prefer to rejoice in what I can do \u2014not mourn what I can't.\" In that spirit, Lena has not only learned to play keyboards and drive a car, but also to conduct a choir, develop a successful professional singing career and compete in the Paralympics in Seoul, Korea.This uplifting personal story, written by a one-of-a-kind woman who wholeheartedly believes that God her Creator never makes mistakes, is sure to not only inspire you, but also forever change the way you look at life.",

Yet in many churches, the connection we crave is lacking. How can church become a place where nobody stands alone?Through small groups. Like nothing else, they provide the kind of life-giving community that builds and empowers the body of Christ and impacts the world. At Willow Creek Community Church, small groups are so important that they define the core organizational strategy. Bill Donahue and Russ Robinson write, 'We have gone from a church with small groups . . . to being a church of small groups.'Donahue and Robinson share revealing glimpses of Willow Creek\u2019s journey to becoming a church where over 18,000 people connect in 2,700 small groups. And they tell how your church--whatever its size and circumstances--can become a place where men and women, adults and children, can experience powerful, transforming community. Building a Church of Small Groups unpacks the vision, values, and strategies required to integrate small groups into your entire ministry. Part one presents the theological, sociological, and organizational underpinnings of small groups. You\u2019ll discover why small groups, as reflections of God\u2019s communal nature, are so vital to church health.Part two moves you from vision to practice. Here is how to develop thriving small groups based on authentic relationships, where truth and life intersect, conflict leads to growth, and skilled leaders help group members mature into fully devoted followers of Christ.Part three shows you how to identify, recruit, and train group leaders and provide them with long-term coaching and support. Finally, in part four, you\u2019ll learn how to deal with the critical process of change as your church develops its small group ministry.Written by two of today\u2019s top authorities on small group ministry, Building a Church of Small Groups is a proven blueprint for health and spiritual vitality in your church.

Morgan Llywelyn, the acclaimed historical writer of books like Lion of Ireland, Bard and The Horse Goddess, is the writer born to bring this epic battle to life.  Having created an entire body of work chronicling the Celts and Ireland, she now turns to recent Irish history to create a multivolume saga: The Irish Century.1921 tells the story of the Irish War of Independence and the heartbreaking civil war that followed. Henry Mooney, a reporter for theClare Champion and the Irish Bulletin, is a self-described \"moderate nationalist\" who struggles to see the truth in the news of the day, and to report it fairly.  Lacking more radical Republican beliefs of his dear friends Ned Halloran and Sile Duffy, Henry reports the political--and later, bloody--actions of his fellow Irishman from the ashes of the failed 1916 Rising to the creation of the Irish Free State to the tragic and wide-ranging battles of the Irish Civil War.Meanwhile, Henry feels the impact of these history-changing events in his own personal life. His friendship with Ned falters when their political beliefs diverge, and an unexpected tragedy leaves them further apart than ever. Henry struggles with his passion for a well-bred Protestant Anglo-Irish woman, Ella Rutledge, and as he dutifully reports the events in the political battle for independence, he comes to realize that the Irish struggle for freedom wil leave no life untouched--and no Irish citizen with a dry eye or an untroubled heart.",

        "Authors": "By Bradford, Colin I. (EDT) and Linn, Johannes F. (EDT)",
        "Description": "The current international system of institutions and governance groups is proving inadequate to meet many of today's most important challenges, such as terrorism, poverty, nuclear proliferation, financial integration, and climate change. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and UN were founded after World War II, and their structures of voting power and representation have become obsolete, no longer reflecting today's balance of economic and political power. This insightful book examines how to make such institutions more responsive and effective.  Institutional reform is critically needed but currently in stalemate. A new push is needed from powerful nations acting together through a reformed and enlarged G-8 that includes emerging economies, such as China and India. Global challenges demand integrated approaches, with greater coordination among international institutions. Global Governance Reform argues that without reconstituting the Group of 8 summit into a larger, more representative group of leaders, with a new mandate to provide strategic guidance to the system of international institutions, the world will fall further behind in addressing global challenges. The path to global reform is defined by the need to act in coordinated ways on summit and institutional reform, and this book lights the way.",

        "Description": "From the author of the bestselling The Modern Girl's Guide to Life comes a must-have book for the young mom, including best-kept secrets, practical advice, and multiple solutions for problems from birth to age fourJust when you thought you could cook (hey, one meal counts), clean (if the queen was coming), and seduce a man (well, long enough to get married), life throws you a curveball that makes all of your previous ineptitudes in life pale in comparison. With the appearance of one little extra line on a pregnancy test, you're thrown into a world of covering up leaks on shirts and taking a pacifier away from a two-year-old who has the grip of a pit bull.In this funny, smart, and honest book, Jane Buckingham cuts through the clutter to give you simple information and practical advice for navigating the different stages of motherhood. From how to get your child to sleep and how to wean, to how to get him off the pacifier and how to stop his tantrums, this book will help moms feel in the know and in control! Some of Buckingham's favorite tips:If your baby has a hard time feeding because of a stuffy nose, turn on the shower to steam up the bathroom and feed her there.Put your children's paints in an empty egg carton -- it's the perfect size, and there's no mess to clean up when you're done. Use an old raincoat with the arms cut off as a smock.You should buy a new car seat, rather than borrowing a friend's old car seat, as there are constant safety upgrades. Also, be sure you are the person registered to that car seat (send in that registration card!) so that you'll be notified in case of a recall.Keep the three-day rule in mind: Almost any bad habit can be broken in three days. Granted, they may be tough, torturous days, but you can do it!The Modern Girl's Guide to Motherhood helps modern moms do it all with love, style, and flair!",

There it is again:Come a little closer...Come a little closer...Listen to the night...There's music in the air...Beckoned by the voice, the boy sneaks downstairs, out the door, and walks toward the barn. As he gets closer he hears the sweet sound of a country fiddler and the rhythmic thumping of dancing feet. But who could possibly be having a barn dance in the middle of the night?",
