        "Description": "Four years in the making, this entirely revised edition of a classic text provides a lucid and erudite review of the state of psychiatry today. Since the publication of the last edition in 1988, remarkable advances have been made in laboratory and clinical psychiatric research; the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) has been published; managed care has radically altered the provision of all medical care; and the profession of psychiatry has come to a sophisticated new understanding of the interplay between psychiatric knowledge and issues in the larger society.All these changes are reflected in the new text. Of particular interest are the masterful and lucid reviews of current knowledge in the neurobiology of mental disorders, in the section on brain and behavior. The section on psychopathology clarifies newly emerging diagnostic categories and offers new insight into addictions, anxiety disorders, and disorders of cognition.Like its predecessors, The Harvard Guide To Psychiatry focuses throughout on the relationship between the physician and the patient. Its unspoken motto is that the art of psychiatry is as important as the science. For this recognition of what is relevant clinically as well as technically, this book will be an essential reference and support for both the new and the experienced psychiatrist.This new edition includes up-to-date discussions of:DSM-IVManaged careImprovements in neuroimagingThe increased use of psychoactive drugsRecent advances in molecular biologyResearch on the biology of schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and addictive disorders",

Dispatched from his Boston-based company to the Mexican border with orders to negotiate a deal that would put profits in American pockets, Reed finds himself on a personal odyssey deep into the Mexican interior.Toma's characters \"both major and minor\" are complex, ambiguous, and multifaceted. Frank's despair and moral confusion, his tendency to sentimentality, and his ethical imprecision are convincingly etched. Toma's portraits of the Mexican functionary, Garcia, and his family are masterfully nuanced though drawn in broad strokes.As the focus shifts from Boston to Mexico and back, the narrative is propelled by parallel involvements of the major characters: Frank's rediscovery of passion with the young Mexican woman, Socorro, is balanced at home by his wife's attraction to a neighborhood butcher and by their daughter's growing interest in a brilliant but alienated young emigre student.As Frank struggles to reinvent the man he has become, he becomes swept up in the plans of the young Mexican woman, who is desperate to cross the border into what she perceives as a land of wealth and opportunity. The extent of his middle-aged angst is matched by the reach of her hope. In this biting, though often humorous, first novel, the American dream turns harsh.",

The topics range from the invention of cinema to contemporary F-X aesthetics; from Shakespeare films to Seinfeld; from '30's screwball comedies to Hong Kong martial-arts movies; from the roots of sexploitation pictures to the televising of Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony. There is an emphasis on the unpredictable interactions between film as a medium apt for expressing the most private dreams and film as the mass literature of the modern world, subject to all the pressures of financing and marketing. Many of the pieces are profiles of individual directors or actors--Orson Welles, Michael Powell, Ed Wood, Marlon Brando, Alfred Hitchcock, Dana Andrews, The Marx Brothers, Bing Crosby--whose careers are probed to look for the point where private obsession meets public myth-making.",

The Faith opens with the story of Jesus himself, the Resurrection, and the spreading of the Gospels. It shows how the young religion's growing power in the East, the cradle of its early monks and philosophers, was broken by the Islamic conquests, and how its energies were redirected westward into barbarian Europe. Moynahan covers in lucid detail the intensity of the medieval faith, with its titanic cathedrals, its clashes between Islam and Christendom, and its fracture into Reformation, Catholic Counter-Reformation, and the religious dissent that drove settlers to seek religious freedom in the Americas.Based on little-known primary sources (including early Arabic writings), and featuring more than one hundred photographs and illustrations, this extraordinary history will be of interest to Christians of all denominations, to historians, and to every reader who seeks a fuller understanding of a force that has shaped the modern world.",

Luxuriate in the faint, honeyed sound of water cascading down an agate slab onto softly worn stones below, or gurgling up through a tower filled with glass marbles...the rustic elegance of an Italian urn engulfed in moss...a sleek meditation table made from a round salt shaker. Add potted plants, fog, candles, light, or scent to create dazzling special effects that engage all the senses. Whether you construct one of the 29 projects here or fashion your own personal creation, your tabletop fountain will float you down a stream of relaxation, far away from the strains of everyday life.",

The Great War has ended at last. No longer must archaeologist Amelia Peabody and her husband, Emerson, the distinguished Egyptologist, fear for the life of their daring son, Ramses, now free from his dangerous wartime obligations to British Intelligence. The advent of a season of joy and peace marks a time of new beginnings in Luxor, with delightful additions to the growing Emerson family and fascinating wonders waiting to be discovered beneath the shifting Egyptian sands. But in the aftermath of conflict, evil still casts a cold shadow over this violence-scarred land. The theft of valuable antiquities from the home of a friend causes great concern in the Emerson household. Ramses's strange encounter with a woman costumed in the veil and gold crown of a goddess only deepens the mystery. And the brutal death of the suspected thief washes the unsettling affair in blood. Amelia's investigation sets her on a terrifying collision course with an adversary more fiendish and formidable than any she has ever encountered. And in her zeal to make things right, the indomitable Amelia may be feeding the flames of a devastating firestorm that threatens the fragile lives of the tender and the innocent.",

But-according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, Fourth Edition, for a child to be diagnosed with ADHD, six or more of these symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity must have persisted for at least six months.Is Your Child Hyperactive? Inattentive? Impulsive? Distractible? offers an invaluable step-by-step program already used by thousands of parents to help you change these behaviors at home.
