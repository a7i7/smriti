        "Description": "\"Judy was one of my idols growing up in golf--she was the leading player of her day on the tour. She's broken important ground for women with her TV work for ABC. And she does it again with A Woman's Guide to Better Golf.\"  -- Nancy Lopez, 47-time winner on the LPGA Tour   \"Judy was the most consistent ball-striker of any pro player I've ever seen. She knows everything there is about this multifaceted game, and in this book she shares that wealth of knowledge with golfers of all abilities.\"  -- JoAnne CarrIer, LPGA Tour Hall of Fame   In A Woman's Guide to Better Golf, Judy Rankin offers a combination of mechanical advice, gleaned from her many years of competitive golf, and practical suggestions specifically targeted to today's woman golfer.   Rankin, one of the pioneers of the \"strong\" grip popular on the tour today, uses that grip as a building block for overcoming the number-one problem woman golfers face: lack of power and distance. She covers the hard-core instruction basics on setup, full-swing mechanics, the short game, putting, sand play, strategy, and trouble shots in text and photographs. She also offers practical tips on taking lessons, buying equipment, and arranging games to keep matches interesting. And she shares her unique observations about the top players-both men and women-in the game today.   In addition to offering no-nonsense, time-tested advice, Rankin has enlisted a little help from some of her friends: LPGA stars such as Beth Daniel, Nancy Lopez, Helen Alfredsson, and Dottie Pepper as well as players on the men's and senior tours have all provided valuable insights anq tips for woman golfers.   Judy Rankin joined the LPGA Tour in 1962 at age 17 and went on to gamer 27 victories during her playing career. She was named LPGA Player of the Year in 1976 and in 1977, and she was chosen captain of the 1996 LPGA Tour Solheim Cup. Rankin, who covers both men's and women's golf events for ABC Sports, lives in Midland, Texas.   Peter McCleery, a senior editor at Golf Digest, specializes in covering television and the major golf tournaments and organizations.",

        "Description": "When Jeff Selis set off to explore this vast country of ours, he brought along his best friend Seamus, his loyal dog Otis, and his trusty 1965 Polaroid Land Camera. Dog Bless America is the result of this three-month-long--and very canine-friendly--sojourn. From a dachshund named Grover Cleveland posed in front of Mt. Rushmore to Rock and Roll, a pair of black labs in Memphis, Tennessee, Dog Bless America captures America's finest in all of their tail-wagging, tongue-flapping, wet-nosed splendor. In addition to meeting the local hot dogs in each of the fifty states, Jeff, Seamus, and Otis encountered calamities, epiphanies, and even the occasional out-and-out serendipitous moment (who knew St. Louis's annual \"Woofstock\" would be held on the same weekend that Jeff, Seamus, and Otis just happened to be in town?!). So if the garbage can hasn't been tipped over in a while, and the doggy door just isn't swinging like it used to, try reading Rover a page or two from Dog Bless America. It's guaranteed to make him proud to be a dog--and an American one at that!",

        "Description": "Widely applauded when it was published last year, Pearl Abraham's debut novel The Romance Reader possesses that quality that distinguishes all great fiction&#151;a fresh look at the universal truths that bind us together.  Like Chaim Potok, who revealed the Orthodox Jewish world from a young man's perspective in The Chosen, Abraham explores new ground, offering readers a tender story of a young Hasidic woman facing the challenges of growing up and the demands of her religion.Rachel Benjamin is the daughter of a quixotic rabbi who dreams of building a synagogue in the secluded upstate New York bungalow colony where his family now lives.  As the rabbi's eldest daughter, Rachel is expected to set an example for her five siblings and for the other girls in the community: she must wear thick opaque tights with seams; she is forbidden to wear a bathing suit in public; and she can never read books in English.  But like all young adults, Rachel bristles at the stringent rules set by her family and her religion, rebelling in ways that become increasingly apparent.  Whether sneaking sheer nylons in and out of the house or applying for an illicit library card that will allow her access to the romance novels that she loves, Rachel is determined to do things her way.  Dreaming of a life that mirrors that of the heroines in her favorite novels, Rachel craves the independence she will never have as a Hasidic woman in an arranged marriage.  And yet, as her impending marriage draws inevitably nearer, the pulls of family and faith weigh against the frightening and unknown world beyond her own.This coming-of-age tale is both unusual and familiar&#151;an intriguing, heartfelt look at the power of family and religion in the Hasidic community and the universal desire to leave the nest.",

        "Description": "What happens when a president violates the U.S. Constitution, resulting in the deaths of thousands? In Warrior-King, public interest lawyer John Bonifaz argues passionately that Bush did just that when he launched a first-strike invasion of Iraq without a congressional declaration of war. The framers of the Constitution, he argues, wanted to ensure that our presidents would not be like European kings of old who could decide, on their own volition, to send their subjects into battle. Only the Congress can send this nation into war?George Bush is not a king. In February 2003 Bonifaz and a coalition of U.S. citizens, soldiers, and members of Congress sued the president and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, seeking to prevent an undeclared and illegal war. The courts heard the case on an expedited basis, but ruled that they were barred from deciding it on the grounds that it raised a ?political question\u201d to be addressed only by the political branches. It didn't matter that the president might trample on the Constitution?the judiciary would only stand on the sidelines and watch. Bonifaz argues that if we are to preserve our Constitution, we must now act: We must call for George Bush's impeachment.",

In essays that range from the contemplative to the urgent, the writers here express their admiration, their fear, and their fascination with the essence of the sea as well as the nature that teems beneath the waves. From a naturalist's perspective to the solo adventures of an intrepid sailor to a curiosity seeker's taste of that staple of the sea - plankton - each essay here represents a special view of the water that surrounds us all. Icebergs and squalls, rogue waves and shark encounters, the sheer exhilaration of open-sea sailing all set the stage for a reading adventure.Fifty-nine full-color photographs bring the smell of salt water even closer, and the thoughtful introductions by editor Joseph E. Brown fit all the writings into a conceptual whole. The result is a bracing deep-water voyage for every reader.",

As both a national and international eyewitness, Daniel Schorr has spent six decades fully engaged in world-watching.  After opening the CBS bureau in Moscow in 1955 and arranging an unprecedented television interview with Soviet boss Nikita Khrushchev, Daniel Schorr went on to a career often revered and sometimes reviled. His no-holds-barred approach to reporting won him three Emmys for his coverage of Watergate, and landed him on Nixon's \"enemies list.\" In the 1970s, his refusal to name sources regarding CIA and FBI misdeeds led to his being threatened with jail for contempt by the House Ethics Committee. Always probing, Daniel Schorr continues in his quest for the truth as the senior news analyst for National Public Radio\u00ae.  This amazing autobiography not only details the life and times of the octogenarian newsman -- the last of the legendary Edward R. Murrow news team still active in journalism -- but also poses some important questions about the future of media.",

Barberone of the world's most inspiring voices on behalf of democratic citizenshipmarshals American political and diplomatic history to lambast the Bush administration's attempt to fight fear (of terrorism) with fear (of \"preventive\" war). Barber examines the controversial issues that underlie both the Cold War theory of containment and deterrence and the dilemmas faced by America today. He argues forcefully against unilateralism, nuclear deterrence, and reliance on military solutions. And he inveighs against the tendency of recent administrations to confuse the spread of McWorld that seductive blend of free-market ideology and American brandswith the spread of democracy. Barber argues for an America that promotes cooperation, multilateralism, international law, and pooled sovereignty. For as law and citizenship alone secure liberty within nations, law and citizenship alone can secure liberty among them, freeing them from fear.",

She is a solitary young woman who is given to long walks along the coast of Lake Superior. On a cold April day, she wanders into a dilapidated house and is startled by a stranger. Martin Reed, ten years her senior, has moved to Michigan\u2019s remote Upper Peninsula to renovate the condemned Victorian once owned by his aunt. Quickly Hannah realizes that Martin is an outcast, too, and unlike anyone she has ever met.Fire Point  is the story of the summer Hannah and Martin attempt to rebuild their lives while restoring the house with the help of Martin\u2019s cousin, a wily carpenter named Pearly. When Sean Colby, the son of a local police officer, returns to Michigan after being discharged early from military service, he cannot accept the fact that Hannah, his former girlfriend, is building a new life without him. As Sean commits a series of increasingly violent acts against Hannah, Martin, and the house, Whitefish Harbor is caught up in a passion play of vengeance and retribution.In spare, graceful prose, Smolens again demonstrates his \u201cskill in rendering scenes of stunning brutality and uncommon tenderness\u201d (Publishers Weekly), which brought his recent novels Cold and The Invisible World international acclaim. Fire Point is an exquisite American story that examines the boundaries of forgiveness and redemption.",

        "Title": "My Turn at Bat: The Story of My Life (Fireside Sports Classics)",
        "Authors": "By Williams, Ted and Underwood, John",
        "Description": "Now available for the first time in years, My Turn at Bat is Ted Williams' own story of his spectacular life and baseball career.  An acclaimed best-seller, My Turn at Bat now features new photographs and, for the first time, Ted's reflections on his managing career and the state of baseball as it is played in the 1980s. It's all here in this brilliant, honest and sometimes angry autobiography -- Williams' childhood days in San Diego, his military service, his unforgettable major league baseball debut and ensuing Hall of Fame career that included two Triple Crowns, two Most Valuable Player awards, six batting championships, five Sporting News awards as Major League Player of the Year, 521 lifetime homeruns and a .344 career batting average. And Williams tells his side of the controversies, from his battles with sportswriters and Boston fans to his single World Series performance and his career with the declining Red Sox of the 1950s.  My Turn at Bat belongs in the library of everyone who loves Ted Williams, baseball, or great life stories well-told.  Red Barber proclaimed My Turn at Bat to be: \"One of the best baseball books I've ever read.\" John Leonard of The New York Times said My Turn at Bat was \"unbuttoned and wholly engaging...the portrait of an original who is unrepentant about being better than anyone else.\"",

        "Description": "\"This book is a fine resource for every doctor, patient, and family who has to confront the reality of breast cancer.\"\u2014Bernie S. Siegel, M.D., Author of Love, Medicine, and MiraclesAttitudes about breast cancer diagnosis are changing, and women and their families are becoming more assertive about managing their disease. They know that more choices are available now than ever before, and they are willing to make them. This book encourages you to take control. Cathy Hitchcock and Steve Austin, N.D., have written a book for women who are ready to actively participate in their diagnosis and treatment. A husband and wife team, Hitchcock and Austin walk you step-by-step through each part of diagnosis, treatment (both conventional and alternative), and prevention (including prevention of a recurrence). With the help of a flow chart, they examine different diagnosis options. They also suggest questions to ask your doctor and offer checklists, summaries, and overviews. Interwoven with all this information, Cathy shares her personal story as a breast cancer survivor. She describes her ordeal upon discovering the lump and the transitions she has gone through to live with the diagnosis in a life-affirming way. Unlike many other breast cancer patients, Cathy didn\u2019t simply accept the choices offered by medical doctors. Instead, with the help of her husband, she studied the research and made her own decisions about conventional and alternative treatments.",

        "Description": "The national bestseller Odd Girl Out exposed a hidden culture of cruelty that had always been quietly endured by American girls. As Rachel Simmons toured the country, these girls found their voices and spoke to her about their pain. They wanted to talk-and they weren't the only ones. Mothers, teachers, counselors, young professional women, even fathers, came to Rachel with heart-wrenching personal stories that could no longer be kept secret. Here, Rachel creates a safe place for girls to talk, rant, sound off, and find each other. The result is a collection of wonderful accounts of the inner lives of adolescent girls. Candid and disarming, creative and expressive, and always exceptionally self-aware, these poems, songs, confessions, and essays form a journal of American girlhood. They show us how deeply cruelty flows and how strongly these girls want to change. Odd Girl Out helped girls find their voices; Odd Girl Speaks Out helps them tell their stories.I'm always the odd girl outNo one talks to meI try to be friendly and speak outBut I'm invisible, see?You know, gossip is a natural thing in high school. I'm one of those girls that will do it right in front of you. I'll whisper at my friends and look at you the whole time. Then we'll all cut up laughing. You know we're talking about you.My best friend and I started being friends with this other girl. But she was fat. It was hard because she always wanted to go down the slide second and she would crush us. We didn't want to tell her she was fat, so we decided to drop her. Her mother called my mother and told her we were being mean. But we just couldn't be friends with her anymore.-from Odd Girl Speaks Out",

It presents RIP, the most widely used \"interior gateway protocol\" in today's Internet, and makes OSPF easy to understand. It also presents IS-IS, IGRP, and EIGRP; explains the set of routing protocols required for interconnections between organizations' networks and their providers. It shows the progress of the technology from EGP, the first \"external gateway protocol,\" towards BGP, the new \"border gateway protocol,\" and the recently developed CIDR - \"Classless Inter Domain Routing.\" A separate chapter presents the requirements of \"policy-based routing\" and details the recent advances in routing technology including multicast transmission, mobile hosts, and the support of real time applications.These technologies will be used by the new generation of the Internet Protocol, IPv6, that will connect thousands of billions of hosts in the 21st Century.",

The concluding chapter, originally published as the lead article in The Opera Quarterly's special issue on the end of the twentieth century, is a thought-provoking forecast of opera's future. Recommendations for further reading, CD recordings, and videos are also included.Opera Canada has applauded Father Lee's 'extraordinary ability to engage, challenge, and enlighten a vast and diverse audience' and called his learning-worn-lightly commentaries 'a unique mix of spiritual empathy, classical scholarship, and psychological insight.'

        "Title": "The Duchess of Malfi (Dover Thrift Editions)",
        "Authors": "By Webster, John",
        "Description": "The evils of greed and ambition overwhelm love, innocence, and the bonds of kinship in this dark tragedy, first presented circa 1613. John Webster's great Jacobean drama focuses on\u00a0a secret marriage that strikes the disastrous spark to\u00a0an inferno of violence. When the Duchess of Malfi marries Antonio, a household steward, her two fiendishly jealous brothers \u2015\u00a0hoping to inherit her title and estates \u2015\u00a0plant a household spy whose treachery leads to a bloody and horrifying climax. Often compared to Shakespeare in terms of his dynamic plots and poetic lyricism, Webster created radical, profoundly original works that feature shifting perspectives and thought-provoking challenges to conventional moral judgments. Required reading for courses in seventeenth-century English literature, this provocative masterpiece from the Golden Age of English drama will not only be welcomed by\u00a0students and teachers of English literature but also a wide audience of general readers.",

        "Title": "Presidents Under Fire: Commanders-in-Chief in Victory and Defeat",
        "Authors": "By Arnold, James R.",
        "Description": "Of all the responsibilities of a president, none is greater than his role as commander in chief of the armed forces. Whether the setting is Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, or Bosnia, the president must make agonizing decisions about whether and when to put Americans in harm's way. Some presidents have risen to greatness as commanders in chief. Others have gone down in history as failures because of their military defeats.What makes a successful commander in chief? Drawing on original research in presidential archives, James Arnold offers four provocative case studies of American presidents tested in the crucible of war.Since the days of the Revolution, Americans have been ambivalent about the power of the military, presenting a perennial challenge to presidents. George Washington had to face critics and doubters in the Continental Congress as well as the mighty British Army. As president, he saw his forces suffer embarrassing defeats in conflicts with frontier Indians before a final and decisive victory. James Polk, a president with no military experience, oversaw a stunning triumph in the Mexican War, helped by his ruthless manipulation of public opinion. But Lyndon Johnson, for all his political skills, saw his presidency broken by the war in Vietnam and his inability to marshal support at home.Most fascinating, perhaps, is the case of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America. Unlike his opponent Abraham Lincoln, Davis had been a war hero and a renowned Secretary of War. Yet Davis failed as commander in chief and doomed the Confederacy to defeat.Focusing on key battles from Trenton to Ia Drang, Arnold combines political analysis with gripping narratives of combat. The result is a compelling history of how presidents weigh political pressures against military realities - and how their decisions play out for the men and women in the line of fire.",

        "Title": "The Soft Vengeance of a Freedom Fighter, New Edition",
        "Authors": "By Tutu, Desmond (FRW), Sachs, Albie, and Hughes, Nancy S. (INT)",
        "Description": "On April 7, 1988, Albie Sachs, an activist South African lawyer and a leading member of the ANC, was car-bombed in Maputo, capital of Mozambique, by agents of South Africa's security forces. His right arm was blown off and he lost the sight of one eye. This intimate and moving account of his recovery records the gradual recuperation of his broken body, his complex interaction with health professionals, the importance of touch and sensuality, and his triumphant reentry into the world. It also captures the spirit of a remarkable man: his enormous optimism, his commitment to social justice, and his joyous wonder at the life that surrounds him. In a new epilogue, Sachs gives a gripping insider's view of the major public events of the last decade--the election of Nelson Mandela, the formation of the Constitutional Court and Sachs's appointment as judge, and his own role with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",
