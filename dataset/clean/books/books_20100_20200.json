Traditional career guides inventory the individual skills, talents, and abilities that correlate to specific existing jobs. Creating the Work You Love presents a unique alternative approach, using self-reflective exercises based on the seven chakras, to help you determine the elements you need to create a life filled with meaning and purpose.Jarow believes that it is possible to live and act from the most authentic part of oursleves, and to express our strongest values, energies, and talents through our work in the world. Concentrating on the attributes associated with each of the body's energy centers, or chakras, Dr. Jarow helps us form a bridge between our personal priorities and the external activities of the work world. Once this bridge is established, strategies are developed to find a career that nourishes all aspects of our lives.",

When Joe Trippi signed on to manage Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign, the long shot candidate had 432 known supporters and $100,000 in the bank. Within a year, Trippi and his energetic but inexperienced team had transformed the most obscure horse in the field into a frontrunner, creating a groundswell of 640,000 people and raising more money than any Democrat in history\u2013more than $50 million\u2013most through donations of $100 or less. This is the story of how Trippi's revolutionary use of the Internet and an impassioned, contagious desire to overthrow politics as usual grew into a national grassroots movement and changed the face of politics forever. But it's more than that. It's also about how to engage Americans in a real dialogue, how business leaders, government leaders and anyone can make use of the most revolutionary idea to come along since man first learned to light a fire. No . . . not the Internet. Or computers. Or telecommunications. Democracy. Joe Trippi explains how\u6c69ght now\u622eternet democracy is transforming every aspect of American life, by evenly distributing power. He reveals innovations that are on the horizon, which companies are poised to become first\u2013movers in this new era, and which are in danger of being left behind. From his behind\u2013the\u2013scenes look at Dean's shocking rise and fall to his \u2ca5ven inviolable, irrefutable, ingenious things your business or institution or candidate can do in the age of the Internet that might keep you from getting your ass kicked but then again might not,\u27caoe Trippi offers an inspiring glimpse of the world we are becoming.

        "Description": "At the age of twenty-three, James Frey woke up on a plane to find his four front teeth had been knocked out. His nose was broken and there was a hole through his cheek. He had no idea where the plane was headed or what had happened over the preceding two weeks. He had been an alcoholic for ten years and a crack addict for three. When he checked into a treatment facility shortly thereafter, he was told he could either stop using or die before he reached twenty-four.A Million Little Pieces is Frey\u2019s acclaimed account of his six weeks in rehab; fiercely honest and deeply affecting, it is one of the most graphic and immediate books ever to be written about addiction and recovery.",

In a remarkable achievement of historical detective work that is destined to become a classic, authors Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince delve into the mysterious world of the Freemasons, the Cathars, the Knights Templar, and the occult to discover the truth behind an underground religion with roots in the first century that survives even today. Chronicling their fascinating quest for truth through time and space, the authors reveal an astonishing new view of the real motives and character of the founder of Christianity, as well as the actual historical -- and revelatory -- roles of John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene. Painstakingly researched and thoroughly documented, The Templar Revelation presents a secret history, preserved through the centuries but encoded in works of art and even in the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, whose final chapter could shatter the foundation of the Christian Church.",

Why do they feel the need to life? Dr. Dory Hollander offers rare insight into the most prevalent lies and the often startling reasons why men tell them.Based on the provocative findings of her research, Dr. Hollander also shows why women are more vulnerable to certain types of lies that others, while helping the reader to understand the dynamics of deception. Learn how men use the lies as a means of both attracting and distancing themselves from the women in their lives and how this affects the women who love them.Filled with highly amusing, as well as emotionally wrenching stories from the men and women in Dr. Hollander\u2019s study, 101 Lies Men Tell Women captivates and enlightens with original quizzes and exercises for decoding \u2013 men\u2019s words and actions.A self-defense manual for women who, until now, have had little understanding of, and even less protection against, the well-told lie.",

Not only was the monthly show a critical success, but the volume of submissions was astounding. Letters, emails, faxes poured in on a daily basis- more than 4,000 of them by the time the project celebrated its first birthday. Everyone, it seemed, had a story to tell.I Thought Mmy Father Wwas God gathers 180 of these personal, true-life accounts in a single, powerful volume. They come from people of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life. Half of the contributors are men; half are women. They live in cities, suburbs, and rural areas, and they come from 42 different states. Most of the stories are short, vivid bits of narrative, combining the ordinary and the extraordinary, and most describe a single incident in the writer's life. Some are funny, like the story of how a Ku Klux Klan member's beloved dog rushed out into the street during the annual KKK parade and unmasked his owner as the whole town looked on. Some are mysterious, like the story of a woman who watched a white chicken walk purposefully down a street in Portland, Oregon, hop up some porch steps, knock on the door-and calmly enter the house. Many involve the closing of a loop, like the one about the woman who lost her mother's ashes in a burglary and recovered them five years later from the mortuary of a local church.Hilarious blunders, wrenching coincidences, brushes with death, miraculous encounters, improbable ironies, premonitions, sorrows, pains, dreams-this singular collection encompasses an extraordinary range of settings, time periods, and subjects.

Late in the game, commentator Tony Kubek asked Joe Garagiola, \"Did you ever see anybody throw faster than Nolan Ryan?\"Without hesitating, Joe replied, \"Sure. Rex Barney.\"Joe Garagiola contributes the foreword for this story of Rex Barney, the man who threw faster than Feller, faster than Ryan; whose pitching career sped by quicker than his fastball because he could not control it. Barney became a legend as part of the most exciting era of the Brooklyn Dodgers - 1943 to 1951 - when Jackie Robinson came in and Leo Durocher switched to the hated New York Giants. Two months after Leo's departure, Barney no-hit the Giants in the Polo Grounds.In his own inimitable style, Rex tells the story of his battle to control his fastball and, later, his own life, and his struggles to overcome illness and a near-fatal stroke. Along the way, Rex takes the reader into dugouts, clubhouses, and broadcast booths to meet many of the managers, stars, and scrubinis he has known during his fifty years in baseball.",

        "Description": "Spontaneous Healing . . . Eight Weeks to Optimum Health . . . Eating Well for Optimum Health . . . The Healthy Kitchen\u2013in each of his widely acclaimed, best-selling books, Dr. Andrew Weil has been an authoritative and companionable guide through a uniquely effective combination of traditional and nontraditional approaches to health and healthy living. Now he gives us a book about aging that is unlike any other in the breadth and depth of its information and understanding. Hugely informative, practical, and uplifting, it is infused with the engaging candor and common sense that have been the hallmarks of all his books.At the heart of Healthy Aging is Dr. Weil\u2019s belief that although aging is an irreversible process, there are myriad things we can do to keep our minds and bodies in good working order through all phases of life. To that end, he draws on the new science of biogerentology (the biology of aging) as well as on the secrets of healthy longevity\u2013 diet, activity, and attitude\u2013that he has gathered firsthand from cultures around the world. In Part One\u2013\u201cThe Science and Philosophy of Healthy Aging\u201d\u2013he explains how the body ages, and he explores the impact of gender, genes, environment, and lifestyle on an individual\u2019s experience and perception of the process of aging. He describes the various would-be elixirs of life extension\u2013herbs, hormones, and antiaging \u201cmedicines\u201d\u2013separating myth from fact and clearly delineating the difference between the spurious notions of preventing or reversing the process of aging and the real possibilities of inhibiting or delaying the onset of diseases that become more likely as we age. He writes movingly about the ways in which an acceptance of aging can be a significant part of doing it well, and of recognizing and appreciating the great rewards of growing older: depth and richness of experience, complexity of being, serenity, wisdom, and its own kind of power and grace. In Part Two\u2013\u201cHow to Age Gracefully\u201d\u2013Weil details an easy-to-implement Anti-inflammatory Diet that will protect the immune system and aid your body in resisting and adapting to the changes that time brings. And he provides extensive practical advice on exercise; preventive health care; stress management; physical, mental, and emotional flexibility; and spiritual enhancement\u2013all of which can help you achieve and maintain the best health throughout the lifelong process of aging.Healthy Aging\u2013a book for people of all ages\u2013is Andrew Weil\u2019s most important and far-reaching book yet.",

        "Description": "In what would be A.D. 600 in our history, the Empire still stands, supported by the Legions and Thaumaturges of Rome. Now the Emperor of the West, the Augustus Galen Atreus, will come to the aid of the Emperor of the East, the Augustus Heraclius, to lift the siege of Constantinople and carry a great war to the very doorstep of the Shahanshah of Persia. It is a war that will be fought with armies both conventional and magical, with bright swords and the darkest necromancy. Against this richly detailed canvas of alternate history and military strategy, Thomas Harlan sets the intricate and moving stories of four people. Dwyrin MacDonald is a Hibernian student at a school for sorcerers in Upper Egypt, until he runs afoul of powerful political interests and is sent off half-trained to the Legions. His teacher, Ahmet,undertakes to follow Dwyrin and aid him, but Ahmet is drawn into service with the queen of Palmeyra. Thyatis is a young female warrior, extensively trained by her patron in the arts of covert warfare. And Maxian Atreus is Galens youngest brother, a physician and sorcerer. He has discovered that an enemy of Rome has placed a dreadful curse on the City, which must be broken before Rome can triumph. Woven with rich detail youd expect from a first-rate historical novel, while through it runs yarns of magic and shimmering glamours that carry you deeply into your most fantastic dreams",

He describes the techniques that can help women gain greater power, discusses the psychological hurdles some women must overcome to improve their game, and gives his tips for developing the parts of the game where women can and should outplay their male partners. He provides a clear image of the proper swing, gives advice on what equipment every woman should carry, and provides wisdom, inspiration, and sound instruction for anyone hoping to improve her game. With the same blend of sage advice and common sense that made his first two books such an essential part of every golfer's library. Harvey shows how every woman, whatever her other athletic gifts might be, can play great golf and enjoy it to its fullest.Harvey has often said that the day he stops learning is the day he'll quit teaching. Fortunately for us all, that day is still a long way in the future for America's best-loved teacher of the greatest game of all.",

The next day, an e-mail message brings her a job offer: to find the few remaining pieces of a 15th-century adventurer's renowned collection of Indian sculptures. Her employer, curiously, wishes to communicate only by computer. She has no idea who he is or why he wants her. But other mysteries soon preoccupy her, such as the meaning of an enigmatic illuminated manuscript&#151;and the sensual transformation that seems to be overtaking her. Through her quirkily decorated diary and the artful e-mail exchanges between Sara and her mentor, Nick Bantock has conjured up a richly illustrated tale of a relentless quest, an amorous legacy, and the resonating power of art&#151;a lush, romantic adventure of the soul that tantalizes the reader to the last line.",
