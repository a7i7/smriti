For Betty Mullard and her son, Bunt, it doesn't concern them - until the mysterious Mr. Hung from the mainland offers them a large sum for their family business. They refuse, yet fail to realize Mr. Hung is unlike the Chinese they've known: he will accept no refusals. When a young female employee whom Bunt has been dating vanishes, he is forced to make important decisions for the first time in his life - but his good intentions are pitted against the will of Mr. Hung and the threat of the ultimate betrayal.",

The one weak link is young Peter, who doesn't understand the rivalry, openly likes the girls, and sees nothing wrong with sitting in their kitchen eating homemade cookies and answering questions about his brothers' plans. Readers will find themselves laughing out loud at the pranks, the conversations, and one unforgettably embarrassing moment. The high-flying humor is juxtaposed with the budding affection between Josh and Beth and the way all the children pull together during a blizzard. The fifth entry in Naylor's refreshing series chronicling the feud between the Hatfords and the Malloys.",

Yet despite her book's perennial popularity, its creator, Harper Lee, has become a somewhat mysterious figure. Now, after years of research, Charles J. Shields brings to life the warmhearted, high-spirited, and occasionally hardheaded woman who gave us two of American literature's most unforgettable characters\u2014Atticus Finch and his daughter, Scout.At the center of Shields's evocative, lively book is the story of Lee's struggle to create her famous novel, but her colorful life contains many highlights\u2014her girlhood as a tomboy in overalls in tiny Monroeville, Alabama; the murder trial that made her beloved father's reputation and inspired her great work; her journey to Kansas as Truman Capote's ally and research assistant to help report the story of In Cold Blood. Mockingbird\u2014unique, highly entertaining, filled with humor and heart\u2014is a wide-ranging, idiosyncratic portrait of a writer, her dream, and the place and people whom she made immortal.",

[A New Earth] helps us to stop\u00a0creating our own suffering and obsessing over the past and what the future might be, and to put ourselves in the now.' 'Oprah Winfrey With his bestselling spiritual guide The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle inspired millions of readers to discover the freedom and joy of a life lived 'in the now.' In A New Earth, Tolle expands on these powerful ideas to show how transcending our ego-based state of consciousness is not only essential to personal happiness, but also the key to ending conflict and suffering throughout the world. Tolle describes how our attachment to the ego creates the dysfunction that leads to anger, jealousy, and unhappiness, and shows readers how to awaken to a new state of consciousness and follow the path to a truly fulfilling existence. Illuminating, enlightening, and uplifting, A New Earth is a profoundly spiritual manifesto for a better way of life'and for building a better world.",

She is a descendant of the gens de couleur libres, a society of New Orleans octoroons and quadroons steeped in the lore and ceremony of voodoo, who reign in the shadowy world where African and French--the dark and the white--intermingle. Her ancestors are the great Mayfair witches, of whom she knows nothing--and from whom she inherits the power and the magical knowledge of a Circe.Into this exotic realm comes David Talbot--hero, storyteller, adventurer, almost-mortal vampire, visitor from another dark realm. It is he who recounts Merrick's haunting tale--a tale that takes us from the New Orleans of past and present to the jungles of Guatemala, from the Maya ruins of a century ago to ancient civilizations not yet explored.Anne Rice's richly told novel weaves an irresistible story of two worlds: the witches' world and the vampires' world, where magical powers and otherworldly fascinations are locked together in a dance of seduction, death, and rebirth.",

From why the coffee in your cup costs so much to why efficiency is not necessarily the answer to ensuring a fair society, from improving health care to curing crosstown traffic\u2013all the dirty little secrets of dollars and cents are delightfully revealed by The Undercover Economist.\u201cA rare specimen: a book on economics that will enthrall its readers . . . It brings the power of economics to life.\u201d\u2013Steven D. Levitt, coauthor of Freakonomics\u201cA playful guide to the economics of everyday life, and as such is something of an elder sibling to Steven Levitt\u2019s wild child, the hugely successful Freakonomics.\u201d\u2013The Economist\u201cA tour de force . . . If you need to be convinced of the everrelevant and fascinating nature of economics, read this insightful and witty book.\u201d\u2013Jagdish Bhagwati, author of In Defense of Globalization\u201cThis is a book to savor.\u201d\u2013The New York Times\u201cHarford writes like a dream. From his book I found out why there\u2019s a Starbucks on every corner [and] how not to get duped in an auction. Reading The Undercover Economist is like spending an ordinary day wearing X-ray goggles.\u201d\u2013David Bodanis, author of Electric Universe\u201cMuch wit and wisdom.\u201d\u2013The Houston ChronicleFrom Publishers Weekly Nattily packaged-the cover sports a Roy Lichtensteinesque image of an economist in Dick Tracy garb-and cleverly written, this book applies basic economic theory to such modern phenomena as Starbucks' pricing system and Microsoft's stock values. While the concepts explored are those encountered in Microeconomics 101, Harford gracefully explains abstruse ideas like pricing along the demand curve and game theory using real world examples without relying on graphs or jargon. The book addresses free market economic theory, but Harford is not a complete apologist for capitalism; he shows how companies from Amazon.com to Whole Foods to Starbucks have gouged consumers through guerrilla pricing techniques and explains the high rents in London (it has more to do with agriculture than one might think). Harford comes down soft on Chinese sweatshops, acknowledging \"conditions in factories are terrible,\" but \"sweatshops are better than the horrors that came before them, and a step on the road to something better.\" Perhaps, but Harford doesn't question whether communism or a capitalist-style industrial revolution are the only two choices available in modern economies. That aside, the book is unequaled in its accessibility and ability to show how free market economic forces affect readers' day-to-day.Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. From Bookmarks MagazineHarford exposes the dark underbelly of capitalism in Undercover Economist. Compared with Steven Levitt\u2019s and Stephen J. Dubner\u2019s popular Freakonomics (*** July/Aug 2005), the book uses simple, playful examples (written in plain English) to elucidate complex economic theories. Critics agree that the book will grip readers interested in understanding free-market forces but disagree about Harford\u2019s approach. Some thought the author mastered the small ideas while keeping in sight the larger context of globalization; others faulted Harford for failing to criticize certain economic theories and to ground his arguments in political, organizational structures. Either way, his case studies\u2014some entertaining, others indicative of times to come\u2014will make you think twice about that cup of coffee. Copyright \u00a9 2004 Phillips & Nelson Media, Inc.",

        "Description": "Henrie O has experienced much sadness and loss in her life--yet nothing more tragic than the sudden death six years ago of her beloved newspaperman husband, Richard, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Then, on a brisk March morning, a package arrives by courier that shatters her fragile peace of mind--a chilling message that claims Richard's fatal fall from a towering island cliff was no accident. It was murder. It is news that enrages the normally self-contained Henrie 0, and a summons she cannot ignore, as she follows cryptic clues and her infallible instincts to a secret-shrouded tropic Eden--a lush and verdant Pacific paradise where giant palm fronds hide evil deeds from inquisitive eyes and the soft, salt scented ocean breeze whispers of treachery and death. At the lavish mountaintop estate of Belle Ericcson--where Richard spent the final days of his life--and in the company of the fabulously wealthy matriarch's large, extended clan, Henrie is privy to the rumors that have torn Belle's family apart: terrible allegations of greed and jealousy; of treachery, adultery, abuse...and of a mystery that surrounds the kidnap-slaying of Belle's eldest child, CeeCee, which may have been what called Richard Collins to Kauai and to his death. Henrie O's anger and pain--her duty to the past and to the cherished memory of the man she dearly loved--have brought her to this island of breathtaking, lethal beauty. But her unwavering determination to uncover the truth in a house of lies may ensure that she never leaves. Because the deaths did not begin with Richard Collins, nor have they ended there. And the closer she gets to unmasking her husband's assassin, the more frighteningly apparent it becomes that someone's dark and enduring homicidal passions have not yet been fully satisfied.",
