        "Authors": "By Jenkins, Brian Michael",
        "Description": "According to a British intelligence report leaked to the press in 2007, al Qaeda operatives are planning a large-scale attack \"on par with Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\" How likely is it that terrorists will develop the capability of such an attack? No one understands the nature of the threat posed by nuclear terrorism better than Brian Michael Jenkins\u2014one of the world\u2019s most renowned experts on terrorism. For more than thirty years, he has been advising the military, government, and prestigious think tanks on the dangers of escalating terrorism. Jenkins goes beyond what the experts know about terrorists\u2019 efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, nuclear black markets, \"suitcase bombs,\" and mysterious substances like red mercury to examine how terrorists themselves think about such weapons. He offers many insights into such vital questions as: \u2022 Do terrorists see nuclear weapons as instruments of coercion or of pure destruction? \u2022 Are those we label religious fanatics constrained by political and strategic calculations?\u2022 If a nuclear attack took place on American soil, what life-and-death decisions would the president be forced to make? He puts the reader in the position of the president to convey the immediacy of making decisions\u2014and the perilous repercussions of each critical decision. Jenkins notes that terrorists have become increasingly adept at creating an atmosphere of nuclear terror. In fact, al Qaeda may have succeeded in becoming the world\u2019s first terrorist nuclear power without possessing a single nuclear weapon.  The psychological effects of nuclear terror are fueled by American culture, which churns out novels and movies in which every conceivable horror scenario is played out. Political factions on both the right and the left also view nuclear terrorism as fodder to support their own arguments. In such an atmosphere, it is difficult for the average citizen to separate real from imagined dangers. Jenkins\u2019s informed and seasoned analysis will give all Americans a levelheaded understanding of the real situation and teach us how not to yield to nuclear terror.",

In the second, alphabetical, half of the book they offer precious guidance to parents facing contemporary pressures and stresses, such as how to keep a child safe without instilling fear, countering the electronic barrage of violent games and marketing aimed at children, coping successfully with varied family configurations, over-scheduling, competition, and many other vital issues today.

        "Authors": "By Mccullough, Dennis",
        "Description": "What's the right thing to do for mom and dad as they get older?Thanks to advances in science and medicine, more of our parents are living longer than ever before. And though we are rewarded with more time with the people we love, we are also faced with new sets of complications\u2014more diseases, more disability, more need for support and careful judgments. Yet while our health care system may help people live to an older age, it doesn't perform so well when decline eventually sets in. We want to do the best thing but are overwhelmed with the staggering choices we face.Geriatrician Dennis McCullough has spent his life helping families to cope with their parents' aging and eventual final passage, experiences he faced with his own mother. In this comforting and much-needed book, he recommends a new approach, which he terms \"Slow Medicine.\" Shaped by common sense and kindness, grounded in traditional medicine yet receptive to alternative therapies, Slow Medicine advocates for careful anticipatory \"attending\" to an elder's changing needs rather than waiting for crises that force acute medical interventions\u2014an approach that improves the quality of elders' extended late lives without bankrupting their families financially or emotionally. As Dr. McCullough argues, we need to learn that time and kindness are sometimes more important and humane at these late stages than state-of-the-art medical interventions. My Mother, Your Mother will help you learn how to:\u2014form an early and strong partnership with your parents and siblings;\u2014strategize on connecting with doctors and other care providers;\u2014navigate medical crises;\u2014create a committed Advocacy Team;\u2014reach out with greater empathy and awareness; and\u2014face the end-of-life time with confidence and skill.Although taking care of those who have always cared for us is not an easily navigated time of life, My Mother, Your Mother will help you and your family to prepare for this complex journey. This is not a plan for getting ready to die; it is a plan for understanding, for caring, and for helping those you love live well during their final years. And the time to start is now.",

        "Authors": "By Bass, Diana Butler",
        "Description": "The conventional wisdom about mainline Protestantism maintains that it is a dying tradition, irrelevant to a postmodern society, unresponsive to change, and increasingly disconnected from its core faith tenets. In her provocative new book, historian and researcher Diana Butler Bass argues that there are signs that mainline Protestant churches are indeed changing, finding a new vitality intentionally grounded in Christian practices and laying the groundwork for a new type of congregation. The Practicing Congregation tracks these changes by looking at the overall history of American congregations, noting the cultural trends that have sparked change, and providing evidence of how mainline churches are reappropriating traditional Christian practices. The signs of life that Bass identifies lead the reader beyond the crumbling \"liberal vs. conservative\" dualities to a more nuanced and fluid understanding of the shape of contemporary ecclesiology and faithfulness. In so doing, she helps readers understand tradition in new ways and creates an alternative path through the culture wars that today arrest the energies of most denominations. Invigorated by stories from Bass's own experience, The Practicing Congregation provides a hopeful and exciting vision for the church. The imaginative \"retraditioning\" she identifies and celebrates will guide pastors and other leaders on this \"pilgrimage of creating church\" and convincingly counter the naysayers that long ago gave up on the viability of the mainline church.",

The congressional hearings, Nixon\u2019s increasing paranoia, and, finally, the devastating revelations of the White House tapes had torn the country apart. Within the White House and the Republican Party, Nixon\u2019s resignation produced new fissures and battle lines\u2014and new opportunities for political advancement.Ford had to reassure the nation and the world that he would attend to the pressing issues of the day, from resolving the legal questions surrounding Nixon\u2019s role in Watergate, to dealing with the wind down of the Vietnam War, the precarious state of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union, and the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Middle East. Within hours of Nixon\u2019s departure from Washington, Ford began the all-important task of forming an inner circle of trusted advisers.In richly detailed scenes, Werth describes the often vicious sparring among two mutually distrustful staffs\u2014Nixon\u2019s and Ford\u2019s vice presidential holdovers\u2014and a transition team that included Donald Rumsfeld (then Nixon\u2019s ambassador to NATO) and Rumsfeld\u2019s former deputy, the thirty-three-year-old coolly efficient Richard Cheney. The first detailed account of the ruthless maneuvering and day-to-day politicking behind everything from the pardon of Nixon to why George H. W. Bush was passed over for the vice presidency, to the rise of a new cadre of Republican movers and shakers, 31 Days offers a compelling perspective on a fascinating but relatively unexamined period in American history and its impact on the present.",

        "Description": "In \"We Wrecked the Place,\" Jonathan Stevenson records the post-ceasefire reflections of thirty-two militants - both republican and loyalist - weaving their thoughts and lives into Northern Ireland's blood-spattered past. Peace is not possible without the consent of the warriors, and many of the men and women interviewed demonstrate a readiness for peace for the first time in their adult lives. Most IRA veterans finally realize that bombs will not produce a united Ireland. Most loyalists finally accept that sectarian assassination only weakens the union with Britain. The Troubles are over for nearly all of Stevenson's subjects, who reveal here who they are and why they felt compelled to turn to violence. Readers will meet Tommy Gorman, who joined the Provisional IRA in 1970, spent several years in prison on and off between 1971 and 1986, and is now a community worker in west Belfast and a member of Sinn Fein: Anthony McIntyre, who joined the Provisional IRA in 1973, was sentenced to life imprisonment in Long Kesh prison, earned a B.A. in politics while incarcerated, was released in 1992, and is now pursuing a Ph.D. in politics at Queen's University of Belfast; David Ervine, who grew up in heavily Protestant east Belfast, joined the Ulster Volunteer Force in 1972, sentenced to 11 years in Long Kesh, was released in 1980, and is now a political spokesman for the Progressive Unionist party; and a whole host of other characters whose stories are integral to the life-blood of the Troubles.",

From the Reagan presidency to the campaigns of Ross Perot and Christine Todd Whitman, Rollins has long been at the red-hot center. Now, in Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms, he gives us the inside story on Washington and many of its most prominent players with sharp reflections, revealing and frequently irreverent anecdotes, and always astonishing candor.Once a champion amateur boxer, Rollins brings the pugnacious spirit of a born fighter to everything he does. Never shy about his opinions, he now delivers the kind of take-no-prisoners honesty for which he is notorious. He dissects the personalities of Richard Nixon, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, George Bush, Ross Perot, James Baker, Michael and Arianna Huffington, and Newt Gingrich. He shows how political campaigns really operate, and he offers keen insight on this year's contenders, from Bill Clinton to Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan.Part autobiography and part political primer, this is a deeply compelling story and a highly personal look into the inner workings of government and campaigns. Ed Rollins's passion for the game and thoughtful insight into our political system make this a must-read for anyone interested in how the game of contemporary politics is really played.",

When Anna Koval decides to creatively kill time at her library job in Austin by teaching herself HTML and posting partially fabricated stories about her life on the Internet, she hardly imagines anyone besides her friend Dale is going to read them. He's been bugging her to start writing again since her breakup with Ian over a year ago. And so what if the \"Anna K\" persona in Anna's online journal has a fabulous boyfriend named Ian?

One devotee, Tess, seems intent on becoming Anna K's real-life best friend and another, a male admirer who goes by the name of \"Ldobler,\" sounds like he'd want to date Anna K if she didn't already have a boyfriend. Meanwhile, the real Anna can't help but wonder if her newfound fans like her or the alter ego she's created. It's only a matter of time before fact and fiction collide and force Anna to decide not only who she wants to be with, but who she wants to be.",

        "Description": "At the beginning of this century, just before Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved their famous breakthrough, powered flight was still a dream. Who could have predicted that only 70 years later, worldwide air travel would be commonplace, wars would be fought in the air, and men and women would explore space? Few other areas of discovery have changed the world as dramatically as has aviation.The story of aviation is one of technical innovation and visionary genius, of extraordinary courage and dogged determination. Smithsonian Frontiers of Flight celebrates the milestones in the history of flight by profiling the aircraft chosen by the curators of the National Air and Space Museum as the most important in their matchless collection. It tells the story of these history-making airplanes and of the men and women who built and flew them.Among the two dozen aircraft featured are the Wright brothers' 1903 Flyer, the first powered airplane to achieve sustained, controllable flight; Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, perhaps the single most famous aircraft in history; the Winnie Mae, flown by Wiley Post on two record around-the-world flights in the 1930s; the H-1, flown by Howard Hughes to break the world speed record in 1935 and regarded by many as the most beautiful aircraft ever built; and the Bell X-1 that Chuck Yeager flew through the sound barrier.All of these, and scores of other historic aircraft, have been preserved for posterity by the Smithsonian Institution, but only a fraction of them can be displayed in the Air and Space Museum. The over 300 photographs in Smithsonian Frontiers of Flight reveal the full riches of the museum's collection and glow with the spirit of ingenuity and adventure.Author Jeffrey L. Ethell, a veteran pilot and acclaimed aviation historian, brings the images to life as he narrates the most dramatic moments in the history of powered flight.",

        "Description": "An inspiring and jargon-free look at how morals guide and inform our lives\u00a0Moral philosopher Susan Neiman makes the tools of her trade relevant to real life in Moral Clarity, steering us clear of political dogma to offer instead a framework for forming clear opinions and taking responsible action on today\u2019s urgent political and social questions. Neiman reaches back to the classic virtues\u2014happiness, reason, reverence, and hope\u2014that were held high by every Enlightenment thinker and draws on literature, evolutionary theory, and contemporary research to show that the pursuit of moral clarity is open to all who are committed to these ideals, believers and nonbelievers alike.",

I almost didn't even go to the Chicago Women's Conference--after all, being thrown together with five hundred strangers wasn't exactly my \"comfort zone.\" But something happened that weekend to make us realize we had to hang together, and the \"Yada Yada Prayer Group\" was born! When I faced the biggest crisis of my life, God used my newfound Sisters to show me what it means to be just a sinner saved by grace.",

Having forty years of political and media experience, Gold sees through the trickery of today's political rhetoric. And in this book, he exposes their techniques, their verbal twists and devious turns of phrase, in a way that is both provocative and hilarious. Including sections such as: \"Truly Stupid Liberal Ideas\" (poking fun at the U.N., Peurto Rican statehood, and voting rights for felons) and \"The American Liberal's All Time Enemies List\" (fifty conservatives liberals love to hate), this book-both mocking and informative-is an enjoyable romp through the language of modern politics.",

But Frederick Kaufman followed the winding road of the American intestine back to that cold morning when the first famished Pilgrim clambered off the Mayflower, and he discovered the alarming truth: We\u2019ve been this way all along. With outraged wit and an incredible range of sources that includes everything from Cotton Mather\u2019s diary to interviews with Amish black-market raw-milk dealers, Kaufman offers a highly selective, take-no-prisoners tour of American history by way of the American stomach. Travel with him as he tracks down our earliest foodies; discovers the secret history of Puritan purges; introduces diet gurus of the nineteenth century, such as William Alcott, who believed that \u00d2nothing ought to be mashed before it is eaten\u00d3; traces extreme feeders from Paul Bunyan to eating-contest champ Dale Boone (descended from Daniel, of course); and investigates our blithe efforts to re-create plants and animals that we\u2019ve eaten to the point of extinction.",

        "Description": "How could Laurel Phelan, a stunning twenty-one-year-old Vancouver bookkeeper/secretary beset by violent nightmares, know that the cause of her dreams began nearly 1,500 years ago? When conventional remedies failed, Laurel sought the alternative method of hypnotherapy and past life regression. The results, spanning many lives and generations, led Laurel to Dark Age Britain and to a shocking discovery - in a past life, Laurel Phelan had been Queen Guinevere. Unwilling, as anyone would be, to accept this, she tried to get on with her life...but her frightening dreams persisted, and she decided she must confront them.Using her knowledge of past life regression therapy, Laurel traveled back to her previous life to try to make peace with the woman she once was. As Laurel's life flows into Guinevere's, we discover that the true Guinevere was a woman of extraordinary qualities - a ravishing, fierce warrior, beautiful and charismatic, dedicated to protecting her people from harm. Suppressing her emotions and her female instincts, she chose not to have children because she wanted to be a leader. At the end of her tumultuous life, she was gifted with profound insights; what she discovered resonates dramatically in the lives of women today. Guinevere didn't need to emulate men in order to be powerful. The true path to potency, creativity, and love is to draw on the secret depths of our feminine selves - as warriors for our causes, nurturers, advisors, and bearers of life.Laurel Phelan's present life has been profoundly affected by her experiences as Guinevere. She chose a new career as a past life regression therapist, harnessing the creative energy that leads to emotional and spiritual healing. Happy, successful, and more personally fulfilled than ever before, Laurel has one deep wish - to share her inspiring revelations with others. Her brave journey into her past proves that we can triumph over death, heal the pain and resolve the torment of previous lives, and renew ourselves limitlessly in the full and fertile circle of female experience. GUINEVERE is exhilarating testimony to the eternal wellsprings of life that ultimately guide us all.",

From the hills and mountains of the Alps and the Luberon to the rich vine-growing country of the Var and the delightful coastal resorts, these communities are special places indeed. In the small towns one finds the true spirit of Provence. Terracotta roofs cling at strange angles to stone and plaster; deep, velvety shade covers the ground beneath tall plane trees in some peaceful square, enlivened by the sound of water from an ancient fountain. Sometimes calm, sometimes vibrant, but always timelessly appealing, the most beautiful country towns of Provence are presented here in Alex Ramsay's perceptive photographs and Helena Attlee's evocative commentaries. This magnificently illustrated survey opens in the west of the province, marked by the Roman presence and home to the lively regional centers of Arles and Uzes. In the center of Provencethe departements of Var and Vaucluseare such attractions as L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, famous for its antique markets, and Hyeres, one of the first resorts on the Riviera. Haute-Provence and Maritimes, which sweep around the north of the province and finally descend to the sea in the east, embrace the varied gems of mountainous Saint-Martin-Vesubie, coastal and Italianate Menton, and Grasse, perfume capital of the world. The variety revealed in this visual and textual feast is incredibleand all set in the dramatic contours of one of Europe's most striking landscapes. Like other volumes in this internationally best-selling series, The Most Beautiful Country Towns of Provence is completed by lists of sights to visit and places to stay and to eat. 260 color photographs.",
