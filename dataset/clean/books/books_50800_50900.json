They pay their dues, work hard, weather deep disappointments. Then their dreams come true.In fairy tales, the Jacksons' material success?plus their \"perfect\" marriage, their three beautiful daughters, and their supportive families?would have signaled a happily-ever-after ending.But real life is different from fairy tales.At the pinnacle of their success, the Jacksons separated. For Alan, musical renown fame, and wealth still did not make up for the marital problems the Jacksons had struggled with for years. And for Denise, building her life around Alan and riding the tide of his success had somehow left her hollow, unsure of just who she really was.You don't have to be rich and famous to go through struggles like these. Sooner or later, we all come to the point when we relize that real joy and peace isn't just around the corner of the next achievement, the next relationship, the next new thing.That's why Alan and Denise Jackson's story isn't just a great read and a dramatic, intimate look at the golden world of celebrity. It's a story of the greatest love of all, the love that will never let you go . . . and how to find it, no matter who you are, where you live, or what you've done.\"Denise's story is an inside perspective on the results of the ups and downs of fame. Her personal struggles with life's ordinary and extraordinary consequences, her passion to have a stronger marriage, and her desire to have a closer walk with God make for a truly inspiring life.\" ?Carrie Underwood, 2005 American Idol Winner, ACM & CMA Female Vocalist of the Year",

The Maytrees is an intelligent, exquisite novel.\u201d \u2014\u00a0The Washington TimesToby Maytree first sees Lou Bigelow on her bicycle in postwar Provincetown, Massachusetts. Her laughter and loveliness catch his breath. Maytree is a Provincetown native, an educated poet of thirty. As he courts Lou, just out of college, her stillness draws him. Hands-off, he hides his serious wooing, and idly shows her his poems. In spare, elegant prose, Dillard traces the Maytrees' decades of loving and longing. They live cheaply among the nonconformist artists and writers that the bare tip of Cape Cod attracts. When their son Petie appears, their innocent Bohemian friend Deary helps care for him. But years later it is Deary who causes the town to talk.In this moving novel, Dillard intimately depicts willed bonds of loyalty, friendship, and abiding love. She presents nature's vastness and nearness. Warm and hopeful, The Maytrees is the surprising capstone of Dillard's original body of work.",

After months of Pound Patrollers attendance, diet, and tough swim workouts, the scale now reads 150. But Maggie isn't resting on her laurels - she's got a busy summer ahead. Not only is Maggie spearheading a Pound Patrollers kids' program but she gets a junior camp counselor job at Camp Sound View. Camp Sound View is a whole new world for Maggie. She works with kids from other schools who don't know her, or what she looked like a year ago. Everyone's friendly, boys treat her like a real girl, and Maggie is mesmerized! The experience is something she knows never would've been possible the summer before. Wounded by Peter's recent rejection and flattered by the unexpected attention, Maggie immerses herself in everything Camp Sound View has to offer. Her confidence grows, and before long she's cracking jokes and initiating conversation without worrying (much) about what people think. It's all fun and games until Maggie becomes so involved, people (Aimee, Arnie and her family) feel neglected. Will Maggie sacrifice old friends for new ones? Will she change what's on the inside as people respond to her changed outside? Can she blend her two worlds together? And will all this tension send her seeking solace in old habits?",

The puzzle is as tangled as the vines on the hall's front gate, but two things are clear: Stephen's uncle kept to himself, and none of the townspeople knows he's dead. But why does Stephen feel that something or someone is in the house?   To escape the slightly creepy feeling that someone is lurking, Stephen starts to read his great-uncle's diary. And a fantastic truth unfolds. Soon Stephen is sure: While the mystery of Lansbury Hall is stranger than he could have imagined, it's not nearly as incredible as reality. . . .",

        "Title": "American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House",
        "Authors": "By Meacham, Jon",
        "Description": "The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington foreverAndrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the  heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern  presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan  who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the  cause of democracy. Jackson\u2019s election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in  which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics.  Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and  the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats  abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson\u2019s presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes  inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers,  he details the human drama\u2013the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers\u2013 that shaped Jackson\u2019s private world through years of storm and victory. One of our  most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior,  the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know  it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona,  his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the  White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating  a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will\u2013 or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson  in the White House\u2013from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman\u2013have found  inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision. Jackson was the most contradictory  of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly  sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was,  in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind;  and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe\u2013no matter what it took.",

Out here on the Great Plains in western Nebraska, everyone understands that if you lose the school, you lose the town.   But the mystery that has Ted's full attention at the moment is about that face, the face he sees in the upper window of the Andersons' house as he rides past on his paper route. The Andersons moved away two years ago, and their old farmhouse is empty, boarded up tight. At least it's supposed to be.   A shrinking school in a dying town. A face in the window of an empty house. At first these facts don't seem to be related. But Ted Hammond learns that in a very small town, there's no such thing as an isolated event.

        "Authors": "By Liss, David",
        "Description": "Benjamin Weaver, the quick-witted pugilist turned private investigator, returns in David Liss\u2019s sequel to the Edgar Award\u2013winning novel,\u00a0A Conspiracy of Paper.Moments after his conviction for a murder he did not commit, at a trial presided over by a judge determined to find him guilty, Benjamin Weaver is accosted by a stranger who cunningly slips a lockpick and a file into his hands. In an instant he understands two things: Someone had gone to a great deal of trouble to see him condemned to hang\u2014and another equally mysterious agent is determined to see him free.So begins\u00a0A Spectacle of Corruption, which heralds the return of Benjamin Weaver, the hero of\u00a0A Conspiracy of Paper. After a daring escape from eighteenth-century London\u2019s most notorious prison, Weaver must face another challenge: how to prove himself innocent of a crime when the corrupt courts have already shown they want only to see him hang. To discover the truth and clear his name, he will have to understand the motivations behind a secret scheme to extort a priest, uncover double-dealings in the unrest among London\u2019s dockworkers, and expose the conspiracy that links the plot against him to the looming national election\u2014an election with the potential to spark a revolution and topple the monarchy.\u00a0Unable to show his face in public, Weaver pursues his inquiry in the guise of a wealthy merchant who seeks to involve himself in the political scene. But he soon finds that the world of polite society and politics is filled with schemers and plotters, men who pursue riches and power\u2014and those who seek to return the son of the deposed king to the throne. Desperately navigating a labyrinth of politicians, crime lords, assassins, and spies, Weaver learns that, in an election year, little is what it seems and the truth comes at a staggeringly high cost.Once again, acclaimed author David Liss combines historical erudition with mystery, complex characterization, and a captivating sense of humor.\u00a0A Spectacle of Corruption\u00a0offers insight into our own world of political scheming, and it firmly establishes David Liss as one of the best writers of intellectual suspense at work today.",

From despoiling an exhibit at the Natural History Museum to provoking the ire of her first boss to siccing the cops on her mysterious neighbor, Crosley can do no right despite the best of intentions -- or perhaps because of them. Together, these essays create a startlingly funny and revealing portrait of a complex and utterly recognizable character who aims for the stars but hits the ceiling, and the inimitable city that has helped shape who she is. I Was Told There'd Be Cake introduces a strikingly original voice, chronicling the struggles and unexpected beauty of modern urban life.",

How might the food replicators work? (And how would replicated food taste?) Is there any scientific basis for all that hyper-high-tech equipment in sickbay? Will it ever be possible to genetically enhance intelligence (the way Dr. Bashir&#39;s wits were sharpened when he was a boy)?      The Jenkinses also chart the remarkable parallels between the Star Trek\u00a0 universe and our own. They find earthly analogues to the Pon farr that puts Vulcans in heat every seven years. They hunt down common creatures reminiscent of the \"crystalline entity\" and the silicon-based Horta. They even introduce us to the billions of life-forms residing in our own bodies and induce us to wonder whether Jadzia Dax&#39;s Trill symbiont is really such a far-fetched notion after all. Throughout, this engaging and authoritative book bristles with insights on the cutting edge of contemporary biology. Discover how close we are to cloning humans. Examine implants and prosthetics that might make the Borg proud. Watch NASA wrestle with the perils of extended space travel as it plans for a three-year-long manned mission to Mars. And learn where no one has gone before -- or ever will go -- as the Jenkinses highlight some of Star Trek&#39;s more notable biological bloopers.Whether you run your own genetics lab or you ran screaming from high-school biology class, Life Signs: The Biology of Star Trek\u00a0 will heighten your appreciation for the mind-expanding magic of Star Trek.",

He recruits an unlikely group of worshippers: his snail-farming best friend, Shin, cute-as-a-button (whatever that means) Magda Price, and the violent and unpredictable Henry Stagg. As their religion grows, it takes on a life of its own. While Jason struggles to keep the faith pure, Shin obsesses over writing their bible, and the explosive Henry schemes to make the new faith even more exciting -- and dangerous.  When the Chutengodians hold their first ceremony high atop the dome of the water tower, things quickly go from merely dangerous to terrifying and deadly. Jason soon realizes that inventing a religion is a lot easier than controlling it, but control it he must, before his creation destroys both his friends and himself.",

He boards at a brothel in exchange for teaching the mistress how to read and spends his nights dredging the Thames for dead bodies and the treasures in their pockets.Timothy's life takes a sharp turn when he discovers the bodies of two dead girls, each seared with the same cruel brand on the upper arm. The sight of their horror-struck faces compels Timothy to become the protector of another young girl, Philomela, from the fate the others suffered at the hands of a dangerous and powerful man.A different kind of Christmas story, this breathless flight through the teeming markets, shadowy passageways, and rolling brown fog of 1860s London would do Dickens proud for its surprising twists and turns, and its extraordinary heart.",

You feel overwhelmed by conflicts without and fears within. You yearn to experience the God of wisdom and power.
