But Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Eliot like Emma and her brother, Zachary, just fine. They also like rules. Rules about: Eating. Sleeping. Cleaning up. Messing up. Emma doesn&#39;t believe in rules. Not unless they&#39;re hers: Eating no broccoli, dead or alive. Sleeping: No sleeping in a room where night rumbles hide. Cleaning up: Don&#39;t. Messing up: Do. Emma can see that Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Elliot have a lot to learn about being parents. But that&#39;s okay---because Emma has five whole days in which to teach them.",

And when she decides to leave behind all that she knows, to grasp at a passion she has never known, nothing prepares her for the painful choice she will have to make.",

This is his story as only he can tell it.Experience the world from Joel's perspective as he takes you on a personal journey with more twists and turns than a Hollywood movie. It's been a life of both great struggles and of tremendous achievement and honor. Yet Joel asserts, 'I am just an ordinary person whom people find extraordinary.'  Be prepared to fall in love with a young man named Joel.  We have known Joel since he first moved to Montreat, North Carolina, eighteen years ago. What an incredible boy he was; what an incredible man he has become. His testimony will stir your heart and forever change you.Ruth and Billy GrahamJoel is a dear friend. His story is truly remarkable. I encourage everyone to read it. It is truly inspiring!Coach Mike Krzyzewski, Head Coach, Duke University BasketballJoel is an American hero.

To spend time with Joel---whether in his book, at a soccer game, or over a soda---is to come away a different person simply because you've been with him. Joni Eareckson Tada, Founder and CEO of Joni and FriendsJoel Sonnenberg's story is more than just an uplifting tale of persistence and achievement.

There are the mothers - like Nadine, spurned, embittered, and trying desperately to hold on to her children any way she can; Elizabeth, the would-be stepmother, who only glimpses the shoals that lie ahead; Josie, the stepmother, who sees them all too clearly every day of her married life. There are the men, like Matthew, who must live with another man's son and without his own children; and Tom, torn between his own desires and what he believes he owes his daughter. And then there are the children, all battling to find a place for themselves in this new order they haven't chosen.With her sensitive eye and unerring ear, Trollope explores the hard-won truths and often harder-to-overcome difficulties of coping with present and former husbands and wives, and, above all, with other people's children.",

Under Robbins's tutelage, Henry becomes proprietor of his own plantation -- as well as of his own slaves. When he dies, his widow, Caldonia, succumbs to profound grief, and things begin to fall apart at their plantation: slaves take to escaping under the cover of night, and families who had once found love beneath the weight of slavery begin to betray one another. Beyond the Townsend estate, the known world also unravels: low-paid white patrollers stand watch as slave \"speculators\" sell free black people into slavery, and rumors of slave rebellions set white families against slaves who have served them for years.An ambitious, luminously written novel that ranges seamlessly between the past and future and back again to the present, The Known World weaves together the lives of freed and enslaved blacks, whites, and Indians -- and allows all of us a deeper understanding of the enduring multidimensional world created by the institution of slavery.",

Her prose is as intensely realistic and compelling as ever in The Man of My Dreams, a disarmingly candid and sympathetic novel about the collision of a young woman\u2019s fantasies of family and love with the challenges and realities of adult life.Hannah Gavener is fourteen in the summer of 1991. In the magazines she reads, celebrities plan elaborate weddings; in Hannah\u2019s own life, her parents\u2019 marriage is crumbling. And somewhere in between these two extremes\u2013just maybe\u2013lie the answers to love\u2019s most bewildering questions. But over the next decade and a half, as she moves from Philadelphia to Boston to Albuquerque, Hannah finds that the questions become more rather than less complicated: At what point can you no longer blame your adult failures on your messed-up childhood? Is settling for someone who\u2019s not your soul mate an act of maturity or an admission of defeat? And if you move to another state for a guy who might not love you back, are you being plucky\u2013or just pathetic?None of the relationships in Hannah\u2019s life are without complications. There\u2019s her father, whose stubbornness Hannah realizes she\u2019s unfortunately inherited; her gorgeous cousin, Fig, whose misbehavior alternately intrigues and irritates Hannah; Henry, whom Hannah first falls for in college, while he\u2019s dating Fig; and the boyfriends who love her more or less than she deserves, who adore her or break her heart. By the time she\u2019s in her late twenties, Hannah has finally figured out what she wants most\u2013but she doesn\u2019t yet know whether she\u2019ll find the courage to go after it. Full of honesty and humor, The Man of My Dreams is an unnervingly insightful and beautifully written examination of the outside forces and personal choices that make us who we are.From the Hardcover edition.",

No one succeeds more brilliantly at blending  these exhilarating elements in breathtaking novels of men and women forced to grapple  with the deepest emotions and the highest risks. And there\u2019s no better proof than Hot Target.  Like most  men of action, Navy SEAL Chief Cosmo Richter never learned how to take a vacation.  So when he finds himself facing a month\u2019s leave, he offers his services to Troubleshooters  Incorporated. Founded by a former SEAL, the private-sector security firm is a major  player in the ongoing war against terrorism, known for carrying out covert missions  too volatile for official U.S. military action. But the first case Richter takes  on is anything but under the radar. High-profile maverick movie producer Jane Mercedes  Chadwick hasn\u2019t quite completed her newest film, but she\u2019s already courting controversy.  The World War II epic frankly portrays the homosexuality of a real-life hero\u2013and  the storm of advance media buzz surrounding it has drawn the fury of extremist groups.  But despite a relentless campaign of angry E-mails, phone calls, and smear tactics,  Chadwick won\u2019t be pressured into abandoning the project. Then the harassment turns  to death threats. While the FBI appears on the scene, nervous Hollywood associates  call in Troubleshooters, and now Chadwick has an army of round-the-clock bodyguards,  whether she likes it or not. And she definitely doesn\u2019t. But her stubbornness doesn\u2019 t make FBI agent Jules Cassidy\u2019s job any easier. The fiercely independent filmmaker  presents yet another emotional obstacle that Cassidy doesn\u2019t need\u2013he\u2019s already in  the midst of a personal tug-of-war with his ex-lover, while fighting a growing attraction  to Chadwick\u2019s brother. Determined to succeed\u2013and survive\u2013on her own terms, Chadwick  will face off with enemies and allies alike. But she doesn\u2019t count on the bond she  forms with the quiet, capable Cosmo Richter. Yet even as their feelings bring them  closer, the noose of deadly terror all around them draws tighter. And when all hell  erupts, desire and desperate choices will collide on a killing ground that may trap  them both in the crossfire.From the Hardcover edition.",

So when she announces plans to marry a vineyard employee mere months after the death of her husband of fifty-eight years, her son and daughter are stunned. Faced with their disapproval, Natalie decides to write a memoir.  Olivia Jones is a dreamer, living vicariously through the old photographs she restores.

General Dwight Eisenhower once again commands a diverse army that must find its single purpose in the destruction of Hitler\u2019s European fortress. His primary subordinates, Omar Bradley and Bernard Montgomery, must prove that this unique blend of Allied armies can successfully confront the might of Adolf Hitler\u2019s forces, who have already conquered Western Europe. On the coast of France, German commander Erwin Rommel fortifies and prepares for the coming invasion, acutely aware that he must bring all his skills to bear on a fight his side must win. But Rommel\u2019s greatest challenge is to strike the Allies on his front, while struggling behind the lines with the growing insanity of Adolf Hitler, who thwarts the strategies Rommel knows will succeed. Meanwhile, Sergeant Jesse Adams, a no-nonsense veteran of the 82nd Airborne, parachutes with his men behind German lines into a chaotic and desperate struggle. And as the invasion force surges toward the beaches of Normandy, Private Tom Thorne of the 29th Infantry Division faces the horrifying prospects of fighting his way ashore on a stretch of coast more heavily defended than the Allied commanders anticipate\u2013Omaha Beach. From G.I. to general, this story carries the reader through the war\u2019s most crucial juncture, the invasion that altered the flow of the war, and, ultimately, changed history.",

        "Description": "In The Girl with the Crooked Nose, Ted Botha tells the absorbing story of Frank Bender, a gifted, self-taught artist who can bring back the dead and the vanished through a unique, macabre sculpting talent. Bender has been the key to solving at least nine murders and tracking down numerous criminals. Then he is called upon to tackle the most challenging and bizarre case of his career.Someone is killing the young women of Juarez. Since 1993, the decomposing bodies of as many as four hundred victims, known as feminicidios, have been found in the desert surrounding this gritty Mexican border town. In 2003, prodded by local political pressure and international attention, the Mexican authorities turn to the United States to help solve these horrific crimes. The man they turn to is Bender. Through breathtakingly realistic sculptures, Bender reconstructs the faces of unknown murder victims or fugitives whose appearances are certain to have changed over years on the run. The busts are based in part on the painstaking application of forensic science to fleshless human skulls and in part on deep intuition, an uncanny ability to discern not only a missing face but also the personality behind it. Arriving in Mexico, Bender works in secrecy, in a culture of corruption and casual violence where the line between criminals and law enforcement is blurry, braving anonymous threats and sinister coincidences to give eight skulls back their faces and, hopefully, their histories. Drawn to one skull in particular\u2013\"The Girl With the Crooked Nose\"\u2013Bender gradually comes to suspect that perhaps he is not meant to succeed, and that the true solution to the mystery of the feminicidios is far more terrible than anyone has dared to imagine. Ted Botha brilliantly weaves Bender\u2019s story\u2013the cases he has solved, the intricacies of his art, the colorful characters he encounters, and the personal cost of his strange obsession\u2013with the chilling story of the Juarez investigation. With a conclusion as shocking as its story is gripping, The Girl with the Crooked Nose will haunt readers long after the last page is turned. \u201c\u2026[a] crackling account of a quirky, maverick forensics artist, Frank Bender, and his largely successful efforts in facial reconstruction of murder victims\u2026. extraordinary is Botha's writing, with his unerring depiction of Bender's painstaking work and the eventual unraveling of the brutal crimes it solves\u2026. the tales in this book accurately capture the dark motives and complexities of senseless murder, and even the most savvy true-crime reader will not be able to resist the author's insightful storytelling.\"--Publishers Weekly",
