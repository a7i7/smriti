Instead, I walked toward him quite calmly, or I thought I was calm. Yet I do remember wondering if I had combed my hair that morning. I do remember being glad I had worn a bra and wishing it were not so plain and businesslike. And I remember thinking of one more thing to add to my 'before I die' list - not the list I'd written out of things a person can actually arrange on purpose, but the mental list of things I would most likely die without: passion. It is a measure of how dazzled I was that I completely failed to see any significance in such a thought at that particular moment.\"And so begins The Falconer, a stunning love story set in the Sierra Nevada mountains, about two ordinary people whose lives are transformed by love.India Blake realizes that she has let her life pass in dutiful commitments, without living fully, without achieving her dream of adventure and love. And then she meets Rhodri, a master falconer who teaches her how to fly falcons - and with whom she discovers the passion and deep connection she has been missing.",

        "Description": "Katharine Graham has been called the most powerful woman in the world, and she is perhaps one of the richest. In the wake of her decision to print the Pentagon Papers, she became the most famous newspaper publisher in America. During the Watergate investigation, Richard Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell, threatened, \"Katie Graham is gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published.\" She didn't flinch and became, to many, a figure of awe.\"There's one word that brings us all together here tonight,\" Art Buchwald announced at her seventieth birthday party in 1987, \"and that word is `fear.'\" The scores of luminaries gathered for the event - senators, CEOs, Supreme Court justices, columnists, movie stars, Cabinet secretaries, even the president of the United States - laughed appreciatively.The laughter of some was tinged with amazement, for they knew her when her husband, Philip Graham - Harvard Law graduate, clerk to Justice Felix Frankfurter, pal of JFK and LBJ, a dazzler who had Washington eating from his palm - ran The Washington Post, which her father had given him. They would never have imagined that the timid wife who walked two steps behind her husband - \"a big brown wren,\" one friend called her - could become the radiant woman toasted affectionately by Ronald Reagan.Kay Graham had grown up in a house staffed by servants. Her father, Eugene Meyer, preoccupied by affairs of state and the economy (he headed the Federal Reserve Board and held other important posts), was a Wall Street millionaire turned public servant par excellence who became a newspaper publisher when he bought the bankrupt Washington Post in 1933. Her mother, Agnes Meyer - \"sort of a Viking,\" as Kay remembered her, \"very bright, and utterly contemptuous of everybody else\" - tirelessly promoted her friendships with the likes of Auguste Rodin, Thomas Mann, John Dewey, and Adlai Stevenson, but alternately ignored and belittled her children. Marriage to a man once described as \"Agnes Meyer in men's clothes\" left Kay shrinking in the background, until the summer day in 1963 when Phil Graham killed himself and she was forced to take over the company.Power, Privilege, and the Post is the story of how Kay Graham grew through sheer determination: at first anxiously dependent on the often patronizing men around her; then stunningly cruel, as she fired one after another of her top editors and executives; and finally triumphant, as she built a spectacularly profitable conglomerate and a newspaper that grew to have international influence.",

Enchanted by its beauty, and enraptured by her first experience of love, Lorna is unprepared for the dark undercurrent of violence and betrayal lying beneath the smooth surface of life in Canterlow. When the mysterious death of a beautiful young girl named Alice captures her imagination, Lorna soon finds herself entangled in a web of dangerous secrets. Alice had also been in love, and by discovering the identity of the young girl's seducer, Lorna finds herself involved in the lives of more than one person with something to hide.",

        "Description": "William Blake's innovations in engraving techniques brought about his brilliant synthesis of visual and poetic art and signaled the beginning of his famous \"Illuminated Books,\" of which the Songs of Innocence was the first and most popular. Unfortunately, Blake's vision is generally known to the world in amputated form: because of the difficulty and expense of reproducing his original conception, most editions of Blake's work offer only the printed text, with no trace of the visual counterpart so essential to his \"System.\"This new, facsimile edition of the Songs of Innocence reproduces Blake's color plates in a fashion which the artist himself would have approved. The 31 plates \u2014 printed on facing pages which are the same size of Blake's own first edition \u2014 offer one of the more brightly colored versions of this significant volume, no two copies of which are the same. As a special aid to readers, a typographical reprint of the text of poems follows the plates. Such classic \"songs\" as \"The Lamb\" and \"The Chimney Sweeper\" are now accessible to all in the symbiotic union of poem and picture that is crucial to a total understating of Blake's mind and art.",

        "Description": "In her highly anticipated new novel, Ann-Marie MacDonald takes us back to a postwar world. For Madeleine McCarthy, high-spirited and eight years old, her family's posting to a quiet air force base near the Canadian-American border is at first welcome, secure as she is in the love of her family and unaware that her father, Jack, is caught up in his own web of secrets. The early sixties, a time of optimism infused with the excitement of the space race and overshadowed by the menace of the Cold War, is filtered through the rich imagination of a child as Madeleine draws us into her world.But the base is host to some intriguing inhabitants, including the unconventional Froehlich family, and the odd Mr. March, whose power over the children is a secret burden that they carry. Then tragedy strikes, and a very local murder intersects with global forces, binding the participants for life. As the tension in the McCarthys' household builds, Jack must decide where his loyalties lie, and Madeleine learns about the ambiguity of human morality -- a lesson that will become clear only when the quest for the truth, and the killer, is renewed twenty years later.The Way the Crow Flies is a novel that is as compelling as it is rich. With her unerring eye for the whimsical, the absurd, and the quintessentially human, Ann-Marie MacDonald stunningly evokes the pain, confusion, and humor of childhood in a perilous adult world. At once a loving portrayal and indictment of an era, The Way the Crow Flies is a work of great heart and soaring intelligence.",

And Rodney Whitehead, a shady antiques dealer, maintains that neither Claudia nor Harrigan is to be believed. When the supposed owner of the manuscript meets with misadventure in a sleazy motel, and Archy awakens in his Miata with a baseball-sized bump on his head, there's no end to the finger- pointing. It's up to the investigating officer, Lieutenant O'Hara, to make sense of the mess, though there's more than a little suspicion that Archy knows more than he's willing to admit about the murder, the manuscript, and its ardent pursuers.To add to Archy's woes, his favorite gal, Connie Garcia, is being courted by the dashing Alejandra Gomez y Zapata, who has vowed to liberate Cuba from Castro and Connie from Archy. But fear not, for should Archy lose Connie, there just might be a fair-haired lass ready to fill the void - so what if she's packing heat? Romance might have to take a backseat until Archy can sort out who's who among this felonious band of ne'er-do-wells and flimflam artists.",

Their tenth novel, A Certain Smile, is a bittersweet story of a perfect but impossible love, set against the teeming, complex energy and hidden dangers of contemporary China.Miranda Graham, a clothing designer and the widowed mother of two teenagers, travels to China to work with the factories that will produce her designs. Sheltered, uncertain of herself, Miranda has always stayed close to her parents and her home. At first overwhelmed by the chaotic foreignness of China, she soon discovers what she never expected or would have believed possible: a passionate, all-consuming love. Yuan Li, son of a Chinese mother and an American soldier, had his family turned upside down by the Cultural Revolution. Now, in the new China, he owns a large and successful construction company. What begins as a friendship based on curiosity and attraction soon blooms into a love affair passionate enough to topple the cultural wall that divides them. They spend every available moment together, until the realities of China--an intrusive government, corrupt businessmen, and Li's wildly ambitious son--test their love in the complex crucible of politics, nationality, and family loyalties.Judith Michael has written an expansive, unforgettable story that explores two hearts shrouded by their own history suddenly blossoming. And they show us how true love can change a person forever, opening the way to passion, fulfillment, hope--and a certain smile.",

He also delivers practical approaches to issues as diverse as bilingualism, illegal immigration, multiculturalism, and health care.For months, worldwide media attention has swirled around Speaker Gingrich as he has reawakened American political debate.

Enlivened with personal tales and vivid case examples that run the gamut from hilarious to the heart-wrenching, The Mother Dance\u00a0 spells out what happens to a woman when two become three... and four. We see why her new life is so different from his\u00a0 -- and how children inevitably help us to discover things about ourselves and our partners that we would otherwise not know. Lerner shows us how kids call on us to grow up and are the best teachers of life&#39;s most profound spiritual lessons.From birth to the empty nest, Lerner&#39;s own experience has taught her the basic lessons of motherhood: that we are not in control of what happens to our children; that most of what we worry about doesn&#39;t happen (though bad things happen that we fail to anticipate); and that our children will love us with all our imperfections if we can do the same for them.Lerner helps us to distinguish what we can change (and how to do it), and when we need to surrender to the fact that our lives -- and our children&#39;s -- may not go as we expect or plan. With the insight, warmth and clarity that characterize all of Lerner&#39;s work, here is a gloriously witty and moving book about what it means to dance the mother dance.",

It turns out that a talented, confident nineteen-year-old stuntwoman named Lark Sondervoil has invited the press to watch her perform the Gaige Move - a notoriously difficult stunt, or \"gag,\" invented years earlier by a master gymnast named Greg Gaige. Gaige was killed in the middle of a stunt ten years earlier, and no one has ever performed up to his extraordinary standard. Until now.Expectations are high. But nobody - not the press, not the film crew, certainly not Kiernan herself - expects Lark's move to turn into disaster when she takes a misstep and plunges over the bluffs to her death.The filmmakers insist it's merely an accident - an occupational hazard of being in a dangerous profession. But Kiernan's curiosity about this case moves beyond the mere interests of justice. She had studied gymnastics herself once, long ago. And her teacher was none other than . . . Greg Gaige.As Kiernan relentlessly dogs the people who knew Lark, and who remember Greg, she exposes the darker side of the movie business. And she's forced to confront both the grim realities of the present, and the painful, half-buried ghosts of her past.",

Yet Clover Adams's death from poison was a notorious Washington scandal.The Adamses were at the center of society in the nation's capital; both politicians and literati coveted invitations to their famous salon. Clover's sudden death shocked her contemporaries and continues to fascinate people more than a hundred years later. In a sparkling and dramatic blend of fact and fiction, Sarah Booth Conroy recreates the strange life and mysterious death of Clover Adams and comes up with an astonishing theory regarding its cause.Secretary of State John Hay called Clover a \"bright, intrepid spirit\" with \"a keen, fine intellect.\" And he praised her \"lofty scorn of all that was mean\" and her \"social charm\" that made the Adamses' home \"such a one as Washington never knew before...\" Henry James, novelist and friend, declared her \"a Voltaire in petticoats.\" Was Clover's \"touch of genius,\" as James called it, in an age when women's independence was corseted by social custom, responsible for her death?In Conroy's enchanting novel of Washington during the Gilded Age, the grand houses, opulent balls, and great art collections form a glittering veneer that masks a dark and sinister reality.",

His solitude is brusquely overturned when the mercurial and invasive Katy Gibb appears. By turn sulky girl and sultry woman, Katy embodies an attitude of entitlement quite foreign to Bland, yet she also appears to offer a last chance for adventure, for abandoning the weight of a lifetime of discretion and responsibility. In the contest of wills that follows, Bland discovers his true nature, his capacity for compromise and self-deception. The result is a novel rich in understanding of human complexity and of the desire to take charge of one's own destiny.",

        "Description": "When East Coast CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, actors, socialites, and famous sports figures need to lose weight, chances are their doctors refer them to Adele Puhn. She has helped thousands of men and women in the past eighteen years. Her lucky clients not only lose weight more easily than they ever dreamed possible, but they keep the weight off forever. The reason for their success is Adele Puhn's revolutionary eating program, which is based on cutting-edge biochemical research and years of experience.Seventy-five percent of The 5-Day Miracle Diet is biochemistry. Glucose is the fuel your body needs to keep going, but when unbalanced eating drops blood glucose levels below a certain point, your body responds with an uncontrollable food craving - usually for a carbo-laden, sugary treat like chocolate, ice cream, cookies, even alcohol - that will give your body an instant hit. The problem is that the overdose of glucose starts insulin flowing so profusely that the rug is pulled out from under you. You are left in a state of low blood sugar with a need to eat more.With Adele Puhn's program, you will learn to eat certain foods at certain times to regulate your blood sugar and keep it stable all day long. When you're in \"good blood sugar,\" your cravings disappear - a process that takes just five days! And not only will you lose your cravings, you'll steadily melt away pounds while feeling more energized, mentally focused, and healthier than ever before.The other 25 percent of her program tackles the fathead mentality that most of us share: the emotional reasons that make us overeat. Adele Puhn gives you powerful strategies for fighting the fathead's sabotaging ways, whether you overeat in response to your feelings, family issues, or old habits that are hard to let go.",
