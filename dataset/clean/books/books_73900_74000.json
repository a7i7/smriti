        "Description": "Momentous events have a way of connecting individuals both to history and to one another. So it was on September 11. Even before more than 4000 people died in less than two hours, there were farewell messages from the sky. In their last minutes, doomed passengers used cell phones to reach loved ones. A short time later, office workers trapped high in the burning towers called spouses, children, parents. Never had so many had the means to say good-bye. During the hours afterward, the survivors scrambled to make contact with family and friends. \"Are you all right?\" they asked. As the enormity of it all began to sink in, the question hanging in the air was, Were we all right? Since September 11, many have noted a humbling irony: the more time we'd spent in the old world and the better we thought we understood its organizing principles, the less ready we were for the new one. Suddenly, familiar terms and concepts were inadequate, starting with the word terrorism itself. The dictionary defines it as violence, particularly against civilians, carried out for a political purpose. September 11 certainly qualified. But American's earlier encounters with terrorism neither anticipated nor encopmassed this new manifestation. Commentators instantly evoked Pearl Harbor, that other bolt-from-the-blue raid, sixty years before, as the closest thing to a precedent. But there really was none. This was something new under the sun.",

        "Description": "Some observers expect China to become an economic superpower. Others expect it to fragment into pieces. Is China nationalistic and on the march, or is it a stumbling Communist dinosaur? Is it already a billion-citizen member of the global village? Is it, as the Clinton administration claimed, a \"strategic partner\" of the U.S.?Ross Terrill addresses the question upon which all these others depend: Is the People's Republic of China, whose polity is a hybrid of Chinese tradition and Western Marxism, willing to become a modern nation or does it insist on remaining an empire? Since the collapse of three thousand years of Confucian monarchy in 1911, China has neither established a successful political system nor adjusted to being a nation state. Today it stands as the most contradictory of major powers, hovering between an unsustainable tradition and a yet-to-be-born political form that would support its new society and economy. Hanging in the balance are the prospect for freedom within China (for both Chinese and non-Chinese citizens of the People's Republic), the future of America's relations with China, and the security of China's neighbors.Drawing upon Terrill's long experience studying China as well as upon new research, this enlightening and rigorous book will be a must-read for everyone who has a stake in the future of the global world order.",

        "Title": "Mothers and Daughters at Home: 35 Projects to Make Together",
        "Authors": "By Lyons, Charlotte and Randazzo, Steven (PHT)",
        "Description": "Busy as we are, mothers understand that childhood is a precious moment with limited opportunities to spend heartfelt time with our children. For generations, mothers have created their own family memories -- and keepsakes -- by sitting down with their daughters and making beautiful things for the home. Constructing a dollhouse, stitching a family quilt, painting a kitchen chair, baking sweet rolls, sewing the eyes on a nubby brown teddy bear -- at the end of the day, the hours spent together making these things are the ones we will best remember.  In Mothers and Daughters at Home, the talented writer and designer Charlotte Lyons examines and embraces the intimate personal style a mother shares with her daughter. Featuring 35 wonderful and easy-to-do projects -- from doll making, quilting, decoupage, and embroidery to papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, jewelry making, and cooking -- this inspiring volume introduces mothers and daughters to the delights of shared creative endeavor. The projects are fun and simple, and produce excellent results. But the most valuable element is the shared experience of making something together.  Inspired mothers and daughters will be delighted with their efforts as well as the moments they spend at work with each other. Organized according to the length of time each project requires -- from an hour to a weekend, or longer -- this lushly illustrated book shows us that anyone can make beautiful and exciting accessories for the home with the simple guidance and inspiration Lyons so wonderfully provides.  Profiles of mothers and daughters show us how deep the family bond can become when creative effort strengthens the mother-daughter relationship. Even the mistakes become cherished souvenirs of personal artistry and remembrance -- made together as dearest friends, mothers and daughters.",

        "Title": "The U.N. Exposed: How the United Nations Sabotages America's Security and Fails the World",
        "Authors": "By Shawn, Eric",
        "Description": "Less than five miles from Ground Zero in Manhattan sits an international hotbed of anti-Americanism.               The United Nations was created after World War II to promote peace and international understanding. But over the years, and today more than ever, the U.N. has failed to achieve its original mission. It has failed to address the most dangerous threats facing the civilized world, refused to condemn terrorist acts, encouraged America's enemies, and supported some of the world's most oppressive governments, all while wasting billions of dollars.               As veteran reporter Eric Shawn of Fox News Channel points out, the U.N.'s iconic skyscraper is where our so-called allies all too often undermine the United States and our vital interests. And for the honor of hosting our adversaries in our own country, Americans pay a whopping 22 percent of the U.N.'s bloated budget.               The U.N. Exposed will give you a rare insider's tour of the United Nations, focusing on many disturbing aspects that have been ignored by the mainstream media. You will learn, for instance:                           how U.N.-supervised funds were diverted into weapons used against American troops                    how terrorists and rogue states seeking nuclear weapons flout toothless U.N. resolutions                    how our allies' selfish economic interests drive U.N.-backed challenges to America's sovereignty                    how kickbacks, bribes, and corruption have pervaded the highest echelons of the U.N.                    how U.N. ambassadors and staff enjoy luxurious and tax-free Manhattan lifestyles and other perks                    how U.N. workers have repeatedly turned children into their sexual prey                      As Shawn declares in his introduction, \"I am disgusted by the fact that the altruistic efforts of so many U.N. staff members are undercut by the greed, corruption, and ineptitude of the bureaucracy they serve.\"",

        "Description": "A tantalizing re-creation of Elizabethan life and manners told with intelligence and wit,\" raved Library Journal upon the publication of To Shield the Queen, the volume that introduced twenty-six-year-old Ursula Blanchard, Lady of the Presence Chamber to Queen Elizabeth I, and one of the most entrancing mystery heroines to come along in many a season.  Young Ursula knows it can be treacherous easing herself into the petty foibles at court, but now, having once saved the Virgin Queen from political disaster, she faces an even greater challenge. Sortie of Ursula's old acquaintances may be plotting to overthrow Elizabeth in favor of Mary, Queen of Scots, and the re-establishment of the Catholic faith. Ardent, some would say fanatical, believers will stop at nothing -- smuggling, counterfeiting, civil war, perhaps murder -- to further their cause. One of Elizabeth's spies is already dead and the clues to his death point in a troubling direction.  Most disturbing to Ursula is whether her old friends Ann and Leonard Mason could be mixed up in a treasonous plot against the Queen. There have been rumors that all is not as it should be with the Masons.  Secretary of state Sir William Cecil needs his own spy in the Mason home and Ursula is the obvious choice, She knows the family, she can justify her visit by helping to care for the Masons' five children, and she can perhaps use her newly acquired skill at lockpiching to uncover some surprising truths.  Torn between her devotion to Elizabeth, still a young woman like herself, and her longing to be reunited with her exiled Catholic husband, Matthew, in France, Ursula makes a difficult bargain that balances personal happiness against duty to Queen and country. Her journey takes her into dangerous territory eventually into the underground cells of the Tower of London itself Whatever happens, she will never again be quite as trusting or quite as secure.",

Cellars cannot find a trace of perpetrator or victim. He can't even confirm there has been a murder, much less that the cabin's owner - and the presumed victim - could be his long-estranged former best friend. But something violent and inexplicable has happened, and each time he approaches the scene seeking clearer evidence, eerie occurrences confound the case further.Someone - something? - will stop at nothing to prevent him from discovering the truth. For the truth is not \"out there\" - it is locked away in Cellars's own evidence file. But it will do him no good unless he has the vision to see what it really means...before it's too late.",

Yet U.S. Navy surface ships and submarines launched hundreds of cruise missille attacks against Iraqi targets throughout the war, and carriers in surrounding waters sent air strikes deep into the enemy's territory. The battleships Missouri and Wisconsin bombarded hostile targets while U.S. sailors fought naval actions beside U.S. Army and Royal Navy helicopter crews. SEAL missions, global sealift actions, mine countermeasures, and operations in support of the economic embargo all contributed to this complex joint war effort that became one of the most successful campaigns in American military history.",

By far the best known of these was Anna Anderson, a mysterious young woman who appeared in Berlin in 1920. Anna attracted a bizarre coterie of supporters\u2014some of whom had known the grand duchess as a child\u2014who risked life and limb, and often all their savings, in a desperate attempt to prove that Anastasia had, after all, survived. But who was Anna Anderson\u2014and just how did she manage to convince so many people that she was the real Anastasia?

        "Authors": "By Bodenhamer, Gregory",
        "Description": "Parent in Control is based on a highly successful program that has helped thousands of parents regain control over their out-of-control adolescents - whether they wreak havoc at home, in school, or in the community. Living with willful, aggressive, and seemingly incorrigible adolescent behavior is a nightmare many heartbroken and confused parents were forced to endure - until now. In this straightforward, hard-hitting, yet compassionate book, Gregory Bodenhamer, a nationally renowned expert on childhood behavior problems, shows parents how to combat an arsenal that ranges from blatant verbal challenges to physical violence, without resorting to harsh disciplinary measures, expensive counseling, or hospital-based programs.Bodenhamer, a former juvenile probation officer, draws on over twenty years of experience working with difficult children between the ages of 12 and 17 and their parents to offer techniques that work in as little as a few weeks. He covers a wide range of problems - whether your teen is simply ignoring household rules, or perhaps lying, or stealing - to more harmful problems, such as drug and alcohol abuse or unsafe sexual activities. Using real-life scenarios, complete with actual dialogue, Bodenhamer walks you through potentially explosive situations, points out errors most parents frequently make, and provides tested solutions to averting immediate danger - and preventing it from happening again.",
