There is no greater challenge to medicine than finding a cure.   Biochem billionaire Tad Mikleszewski (called TM by nearly everyone) is a \"space junkie\" who has been the primary investor backing the Spacelifter project, a private attempt to build a single-stage to orbit vehicle.  But Spacelifter's crucial test firing has failed, and TM is going to pull the plug.  He has a better idea for getting himself into space....he'll buy research time on the International Space Station, to work on a cure for X-Pox.  The Russians will sell him a seat on the Soyuz taxi vehicle for a mere $30 million.But the equipment in the Harmony Laboratory module was salvaged from old Russian military labs, and perhaps TM's skills are a little bit out of date.  A tiny leak - a small hole in the seal of the isolation box where TM is manipulating the X-Pox pathogen, and Harmony is contaminated by the  disease that kills within three weeks.  Now it's a race against time, to rescue the crew and decontaminate the Space Station.  NASA has a shuttle a month from launch, and if Astronaut Kelly Gessner can be retrained in decontamination procedures they can push that up two weeks.  The Russians have a third Soyuz due off the assembly line, but Astronaut Mark Koskinen, NASA's chief of staff at Star City doesn't think they'll make it in time.  But whether Russian or American, someone is going to have to get up there, and fast.",

        "Authors": "By Gaffney, Patricia",
        "Description": "From the author of the New York Times bestsellers The Saving Graces and Circle of Three comes the poignant story of two women struggling to come to terms with the past that haunts them both.For sixteen years Anna has studiously avoided her Aunt Rose. Exchanging cards at holiday time -- that's as far as Anna is willing to go with the woman she once loved more than anyone else in the world. That love died the night Rose betrayed Anna and her mother -- Rose's own fatally ill sister -- and Anna can't forgive or forget. Years have passed since she's been back to her hometown on Maryland's Eastern Shore, where Rose still runs the aging family restaurant, the Bella Sorella. Anna has built a life elsewhere with a job she likes and a man she loves. Or so she thought.The problem, or one of them, was that circumstances had split her life down the middle. She was always of two minds, the hopeful half versus the skeptic, optimist against pessimist. Or maybe it had evened out and she was now a relativist, a contingency artist. Either way, it didn't help that at this late date a theme was taking shape -- a motif or whatever you wanted to call it, a pattern -- consisting of Anna walking in on trusted loved ones in bed with each other.Anna clearly needs an escape, but the only place for her to go is home: to the family, to the restaurant, to Rose, who has been trying for more than a decade to regain Anna's trust. And right now Rose needs her more than ever. Feelings between the two women remain as chilly as ever, even in the steamy kitchen of the Bella Sorella, where values clash and generations collide -- and outside it, where their personal lives become entangled in surprising ways. Anna is a reluctant partner in this intricate dance of forgiveness and reconciliation, insisting that her stay is only temporary. Her plan is to leave a second time, as soon as the restaurant is back on its feet and her own hurt is healed. But her determination to remain unaffected by Rose's longing to undo the past and create a future blinds Anna to a chance for human connection and she almost fails to recognize true love, even when it reaches in and grabs her by the heart.Touching, funny, poignant, and wise,Flight Lessons is a moving story of truth and loyalty, of the bonds that shape and sustain us and, ultimately, uplift us. Patricia Gaffney once again delivers a story told with grace and warmth, filled with the recognition of self and reminding us that there's no place like home.",

Drawn together by the perils of war photojournalism, Val and one of her colleagues, the British Tony Hampton, find themselves in the throes of a romance that is tragically cut short when Val, Tony, and their American colleague Jake Newberg are caught in a nightmarish ambush. When Val wakes up in a Belgrade hospital, she learns that Tony has died.Later, when she and Jake attend Tony's memorial service in London, Val's memories of Tony are gravely shaken by the realization that throughout their relationship he had lied, telling her that he was divorced. Reeling from his death and betrayal, Val and Jake return home to Paris, where they recover from their wounds and try to make sense of Tony's lies to both of them. As they begin to build a relationship and leave the events of the war behind them, Jake confesses his longtime love for her.But for Val, peace with herself is elusive, as she tries to reconcile her love of photography with the perils of her career, not to mention the claims on her heart. The desire for a fresh new beginning leads her to trade the grueling world of war photojournalism for a glamorous position as a photographer of celebrities--which lands her in Mexico, snapping the dashing Alexander St. Just Stevens (born Bill Smith in Leeds, England), an artist of international renown whose reputation as a playboy doesn't steel him against a powerful attraction to Val. Finding a new mode of photojournalism--and a new admirer--still can't ease her sense of searching for something, a sense that will lead her to retrace paths she thought were left behind.Where You Belong is a moving story about a young woman's realization of her own inner strength and her ability to find her way to where she belongs in life...in love...and within herself.",

At the close of The Last Precinct, she knew she would have to leave Richmond if she were to find any peace. She feared that she was about to be fired by the governor. More alarming, she was hounded in the media and in the courtroom, for what some claimed was her involvement in the murder of a deputy police chief. So Scarpetta packed up her belongings and set out for the warmth and solace of the Florida sun.She is settling into a new life as a private forensic consultant and is deep into a case that has left colleagues in Louisiana profoundly disturbed. A woman is found dead in a seedy hotel, dressed to go out, keys in her hand. Her history of blackouts, and her violent outbursts while under their spell, offer more questions than clues about the cause of her death. Then Scarpetta receives news that chills her to the core: Jean-Baptiste Chandonne - the vicious and unrepentant Wolfman, who pursued her to her very doorstep - asks to see her. From his cell on death row, he demands an audience with the legendary Dr. Scarpetta. Only to her will he tell the secrets he knows the authorities desire: the evidence that will bring a global investigation to a swift conclusion. Scarpetta, her niece Lucy, and her colleague Detective Pete Marino are left to wonder: After all the death and destruction, what sort of endgame could this violent psychopath have in mind? And could this request be somehow related to the Louisiana case?Her friends and family by her side, Scarpetta must unravel a twisting conspiracy with an international reach and confront the shock of her life - a blow that will force her to question the loyalty and trust of all she holds dear.",

But Franz is an optimist. He didn't panic (well, maybe just a little).

The two loves of his life - his longtime girlfriend and his career - had suddenly evaporated.So Franz chose to continue the festivities. He grabbed his recently divorced brother, Kurt, and took off on his deluxe Costa Rican honeymoon.

Big time. They quit their jobs, sold their homes, gave away their clothes and furniture, discarded cell phones and pagers (Kurt used a nine iron on his), and continued the honeymoon for a couple of years through fifty-three countries in Eastern Europe, South America, Asia, and Africa.Honeymoon with My Brother is a book about the discoveries Franz and Kurt made during their two years on the road and how Franz exchanged heartbreak for a new view of himself and the world.",

She was an only child who grew up with the best private schools, debutante balls, and a home in Hancock Park, Los Angeles's old-money enclave. But beneath her family's facade of keeping up appearances, Hope hid a host of ugly truths, including an insecure, competitive mother, a family friend's sexual advances, and a father who gave in to the demands of his wife and coolly reserved parents. Hope became addicted to a quest for physical perfection in place of her self-esteem - and by the age of twenty-seven she had undergone seven plastic surgeries. Hope recounts her downward spiral that alienated her family and friends, and led her to theft, bankruptcy, and a sadistic relationship before she began her recovery.A response to a culture obsessed with extreme makeovers and risky procedures that promise flawlessness, Beautiful Stranger is a timely, cautionary tale.",

        "Description": "In March 2005, Ashley Smith made headlines around the globe when she miraculously talked her way out of the hands of alleged courthouse killer Brian Nichols after he took her hostage for seven hours in her suburban Atlanta apartment. In this moving, inspirational account, the twenty-seven-year-old widowed mother of a six-year-old girl shares for the first time the little-known details of her traumatic ordeal and expands on how her faith and the bestselling book The Purpose-DrivenLife helped her survive and bring the killer's murderous rampage to a peaceful end. Like her captor, Smith too has faced darkness and despair. Yet even during the most desolate times of her life, she yearned for something better. Seeking a new life, she moved to Atlanta, got a job, enrolled in a medical assistant training program, and was beginning to find her way to becoming the kind of mom she wanted her little girl to have. Then Brian Nichols took her hostage. Just hours earlier, he'd allegedly shot to death a judge, a court reporter, a deputy, and a federal agent and escaped in a stolen vehicle. Ashley had paid only passing attention to media coverage of the unfolding manhunt. Now she found herself face-to-face with Nichols, a desperate, heavily armed man with nothing left to lose. Unlikely Angel is Ashley's gripping, powerful account of how this nightmare scenario developed into a remarkable connection between a man wanted for multiple murders and a single mother struggling to make a fresh beginning from her troubled past. Juxtaposing the minute-by-minute tale of her experience with the never-before-told tragedies and triumphs of her own life, Unlikely Angelis a story that will leave no reader untouched.Ashley has made appearances on Oprah, Good Morning America, 20/20, and Larry King Live.",

I am still discovering what that reason is, what it is that God wants to happen.\u201d\u2013CLAY AIKEN, from Learning to SingWhen he was a kid singing in his church choir, Clay Aiken never dreamed of becoming a pop music star. His ambition was to be a teacher, maybe even a high school principal. But Clay\u2019s mother was right, and the music that was Clay\u2019s joy in life was destined to lead him to unexpected triumphs.In Learning to Sing, Clay details what his astonishing success has meant to him. He writes from the heart about his life before and since his instant stardom on American Idol, how he has changed, and how he struggles to adapt to life in the public eye. He speaks candidly about his lonely childhood: the father who abandoned him, the school bullies who tormented him, the mother who taught him to be strong, and the friends and teachers who\u2013more than they ever knew\u2013kept him going. He describes his new high-profile life in Los Angeles\u2013 the awards shows, the free clothes, the unfortunate presence of avocado on all the food. More significant, he reveals what he has discovered from diving into the white-hot center of pop culture: what it takes for him to stay true to himself and remember the lessons he learned growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina.Clay shares his struggle to remain a man his mother can be proud of, and writes about the faith that sustains him today just as it did when he was an awkward, unpopular outsider. \u201cI believe God has a direction for me. He did not give me this life just so I could buy a big house and an SUV. My job is to give back and to be a decent human being no matter how many people cheer my name.\u201dClay\u2019s friends\u2013the old ones from North Carolina and the millions of new ones who love his voice\u2013will hold this inspiring memoir as close to their hearts as they do his music.

But when a long-term relationship breaks up badly, he retreats to his Texas hometown - only to have his newfound peace of mind permanently, profoundly, shattered.One afternoon over lunch, Ross is approached by a woman to whom he feels an irresistible attraction. She introduces herself as Celeste Lacan and asks him to take on a new commission, a sculpture of her younger sister, Leda, promising that the job will present artistic challenges unlike any he has encountered before. Though reluctant, Ross can't help but be intrigued: by Celeste herself and by a photo of Leda's face, a portrait of incomparable beauty.When he meets her, Ross is stunned to discover that Leda's body is as startlingly unique as her face is beautiful. Just as Celeste predicted, he becomes consumed with portraying the duality of her body...and, perhaps, her soul. At the same time, he becomes increasingly aware that the enigmatic depth he sees in Celeste is as mesmerizing as the fathomless torment he sees in Leda. Soon he's romantically involved with one sister; his relationship with the other is much harder to define.As Ross begins to sculpt, Leda vacillates between seductiveness and a mystifying aloofness, while Celeste begins to withdraw from his touch. Then a sudden, violent murder draws him deeper into their world. Too late, Ross will learn that his bond with the women is older, darker - and more explosive - than he could ever have imagined.",

Acclaimed historian Stephen Ambrose begins his examination with a glance inward -- he starts this book with his brothers, his first and forever friends, and the shared experiences that join them for a lifetime, overcoming distance and misunderstandings. He next writes of Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had a golden gift for friendship and who shared a perfect trust with his younger brother Milton in spite of their apparently unequal stations. With great emotion, Ambrose describes the relationships of the young soldiers of Easy Company who fought and died together from Normandy to Germany, and he recalls with admiration three unlikely friends who fought in different armies in that war. He recounts the friendships of Lewis and Clark and of Crazy Horse and He Dog, and he tells the story of the Custer brothers who died together at the Little Big Horn. Ambrose remembers and celebrates the friends he has made and kept throughout his life.  Comrades concludes with the author's recollection of his own friendship with his father. \"He was my first and always most important friend,\" Ambrose writes. \"I didn't learn that until the end, when he taught me the most important thing, that the love of father-son-father-son is a continuum, just as love and friendship are expansive.\"",

It contains many non-traditional sources for quotations; new additions represent television, movies, politics, pop and rock music, advertising slogans, and even street slang.The sixteenth edition contains over 20,000 quotations, representing 2,550 authors, 340 of whom are new to Bartlett's. Although Shakespeare and the Bible are still the most heavily quoted sources, this new edition casts a wider net than its predecessors in broadening Bartlett's cultural base. Newcomers include Russell Baker, Leonard Bernstein, Mel Brooks, Noam Chomsky, Annie Dillard, Elvis, M. F. K. Fisher, Stephen Hawking, Milan Kundera, John Lennon, Norman Mailer, Nelson Mandela, Salman Rushdie, Dr. Seuss, Sun-Tsu, the Talmud, Alice Walker, and Elie Wiesel.Mr. Kaplan, with the assistance of a number of scholars and the Little, Brown editorial staff, has given even the mainstays of Bartlett's close scrutiny. Not only has the general text been considerably revised, the supplementary information in the footnotes has been thoroughly edited and pruned. Several quotations that were formerly in the footnotes have been moved to the main text.In the famous Bartlett's tradition, authors are arranged in chronological order, which illuminates the prevailing influences and ideas surrounding any given quotation. The general index, more than 600 pages long, continues to be an invaluable resource for finding quotations by way of keywords; it has been painstakingly edited to be more accurate and complete.Whether for sheer enjoyment or literary pursuit, for inspiration or adding zest to conversation or a presentation, for research or for the ultimate source for \"Who said that,\" this new edition of Bartlett's is a map through our culture and history.",

        "Description": "With over 900 entries, ranging from brief definitions to substantial essays on major topics,The Oxford Companion to the Mind takes the reader on a dazzling tour of this endlessly fascinating subject, spanning many disciplines within the broad compass of philosophy, psychology and the physiology of the brain. An important feature of the book is the large number of articles on \"topics of mental life\", in which well-known writers discuss subjects in which they have a particular expertise. Noam Chomsky writes on his own theory of language, Idries Shah on Sufism, John Bowlby on attachment theory, B.F. Skinner on behaviorism, Oliver Sacks on nothingness, A.J. Ayer on philosophical views of the relation between mind and body, and R.D. Laing on interpersonal experience. The editor, Richard Gregory, contributes entries on aesthetics, phrenology, physiognomy, and illusions of perception.The Companion includes entries on such everyday events as sleep, humor, forgetting, and hearing, as well as specialized topics such as bilingualism, jet-lag, military incompetence, computer chess, and animal magnetism. What can, and all too often does, go wrong with the mind is also covered--many forms of mental illness are explored, as well as mental handicap, brain damage, and neurological disorders. Perception and the ways in which our senses are often deceived are treated in full, as are elements of personal development and learning, and the puzzling world of parapsychology with its altered states of consciousness, out-of-body experiences, and extra-sensory perception. The workings of the nervous system are explained in a special tutorial article.The text is supplemented by brief definitions of specialist terms and by biographies of major figures who have contributed to our understanding of the mind--individuals as varied as Plato, Johannes Kepler, William James, Sigmund Freud, and Alan Turing. The entries are arranged alphabetically and, following the style of other recent Companions, are linked by a network of helpful cross-references. The 160 illustrations have been carefully chosen to amplify the text, while specialist bibliographies provide suggestions for further reading.",

        "Description": "Piano Lessons is Noah Adams's delightful and moving chronicle of his fifty-second year - a year already filled with long, fast workdays and too little spare time - as he answers at last a lifelong call: to learn to play the piano. The twelve monthly chapters span from January - when after decades of growing affection for keyboard artists and artisans he finally plunges in and buys a piano - through December, when as a surprise Christmas present for his wife he dresses in a tuxedo and, in flickering candlelight, snow falling outside the windows, he attempts their favorite piece of music, a difficult third-year composition he's been struggling with in secret to get to this very moment.Among the up-tempo triumphs and unexpected setbacks, Noah Adams interweaves the rich history and folklore that surround the piano. And along the way, set between the ragtime rhythms and boogie-woogie beats, there are encounters with - and insights from - masters of the keyboard, from Glenn Gould and Leon Fleisher (\"I was a bit embarrassed,\" he writes; \"telling Leon Fleisher about my ambitions for piano lessons is like telling Julia Child about plans to make toast in the morning\") to Dr. John and Tori Amos.As a storyteller, Noah Adams has perfect pitch. In the foreground here, like a familiar melody, are the challenges of learning a complex new skill as an adult, when enthusiasm meets the necessary repetition of tedious scales at the end of a twelve-hour workday. Lingering in the background, like a subtle bass line, are the quiet concerns of how we spend our time and how our priorities shift as we proceed through life. For Piano Lessons is really an adventure story filled with obstacles to overcome and grand leaps forward, eccentric geniuses and quiet moments of predawn practice, as Noah Adams travels across country and keyboard, pursuing his dream and keeping the rhythm.",

        "Description": "Monty Roberts is a real-life horse whisperer--an American original whose gentle training methods reveal the depth of communication possible between man and animal. He can take a wild, high-strung horse who has never before been handled and persuade that horse to accept a bridle, saddle, and rider in thirty minutes. His powers may seem like magic, but his amazing \"horse sense\"\u00a0\u00a0is based on a lifetime of experience. Roberts started riding at the age of two, and at the age of thirteen he went alone into the high deserts of Nevada to study mustangs in the wild. What he learned there changed his life forever. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Monty Roberts has spent his whole life working with horses--schooling them, listening to them, and learning their ancient equine language. In The Man Who Listens to Horses, he tells about his early days as a rodeo rider in California, his problems with his violent horse-trainer father, who was unwilling to accept Monty's unconventional training methods, his friendship with James Dean, his struggle to be accepted in the professional horse-training community, and the invitation that changed his life--to demonstrate his method of \"join-up\"\u00a0\u00a0to the Queen of England. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From his groundbreaking work with horses, Roberts has acquired an unprecedented understanding of nonverbal communication, an understanding that applies to human relationships as well. He has shown that between parent and child, employee and employer (he's worked with over 250 corporations, including General Motors, IBM, Disney, and Merrill Lynch), and abuser and abused, there are forms of communication far stronger than the spoken word and that they are accessible to all who will learn to listen. This inspirational and gentle man, first introduced to the American public on Dateline NBC, is part James Herriot, part Bill Gates, and part John Wayne. And his story is one you will never forget.",

        "Description": "Everybody knows the Ten Commandments, right? Let&#39;s see. There&#39;s something about stealing, lying, murdering...ah...but that&#39;s only three...what are the rest? More people claim to live by the Ten Commandments than seem to know what they are, let alone what they mean. And in this modern, jet-propelled, nuclear, genetic-engineered world, how important are they?  Each day we make innumerable decisions about things that don&#39;t really seem earth-shattering in importance. So what if we break a promise? So what if we are married but find passion in another bed? So what if we are too focused on work, TV, or clubs to spend time with family? In The Ten Commandments, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, America&#39;s \"Mommy\" and the conscience of talk radio, reminds is that it is in everyday decisions that we give meaning to our lives or diminish it; and  she shows us why adhering to the higher ideals and consistent morality found in the Commandments can create a life of greater purpose, integrity, value, and lasting joy.  The Ten Commandment&#39;s  are the first direct communication between a people and God. Designed to elevate our lives above mere frantic, animal existence to the sublime levels humanity is capable of experiencing, they are the blueprint of God&#39;s expectations of us and His plan for a meaningful, just, loving, and holy life. Each of the Ten Commandments asserts a principle, and each principle is a moral focal point for real-life issues relating to God, family, sex, work, charity, property, speech, and thought. These principles, and the Commandments they are based upon, are as relevant today as they were in Biblical times.  Written in collaboration with Rabbi Steward Vogel, The Ten Commandments is a modern application of God&#39;s laws, incorporating lively discussion on the Bible and the Judeo-Christian values derived from it. Filled with passion, emotion, and provocative, profound insight. The Ten Commandments will move, enlighten, inspire, educate, and entertain you. You won&#39;t be able to look at  even mundane moments in your life the same way again.  I am the Lord, your God, who has taken you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery  Acceptance of God as the ultimate author of morality and leaning of life.  You shall not recognize the gods of others in My presence  Beware of idolatry. Attaining money, power, stimulation, professional success, and accumulating possessions, while legitimate pursuits, are not the ultimate purpose of life. You shall not take the Name of the Lord, your God, in vain  How we acknowledge or deny God and godliness through our words and deeds. Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it  Recognize the value of time by refocusing on the most important elements of life; family, obligations to others, prayer, kindness, justice, and decency.  Honor your Father and your Mother  The obligation to parents reinforces the concepts of treating others responsibly in spite of sentiment or situation. You shall not murder  Each human being is the essence of uniqueness, yet equally created in God&#39;s image. Not only can a life by physically taken, but demoralization and humiliation can kill our souls.  You shall not commit adultery  Sexual relations are made special and hole through a consonantal marriage. The honoring of commitments provides the family stability necessary for individual growth and health, community peace, and societal welfare. You shall not steal  Respecting the property and reputation of others provides mutual safety, peace, and prosperity.  You shall not bear false witness against your fellow   While we should keep far from falsehood, knowing when information could or should be shared can make the differences between destroying and helping others. You shall not covet  Desire for the possessions of others destroys relationships and leads us to violate the other Commandments.",

Now, with a wonderful new pageturner, this daringly original storyteller makes her smashing hardcover debut.  A talented landscape painter and portrait artist in her early thirties, Paris Sweeney has achieved enviable success: her work sells at an exclusive New York City gallery owned by her friend, Candra Worth, and her popularity is at an all-time high. Sweeney, as she is affectionately called by those close to her, loves her work and is content with her life.  Then she begins to notice odd changes: traffic lights turn green when she approaches. Her plants are in full bloom out of season. Perhaps they're jist coincidences, but she can't ignore her dreams -- lush, vivid, and drenched in vibrant hues -- which are influencing her artwork. And she can't deny her growing restlessness....Suddenly, impulsively, Sweeney finds herself unable to resist a night of intense passion with millionaire Richard Worth, Candra's estranged husband. But the true dangers of her all-consuming urges are about to be revealed where Sweeney least expects it: in her paintings.  After a creative frenzy she can barely recall, Sweeney discovers she has rendered a disturbing image -- a graphic murder scene. Against her better instincts, she returns to the canvas time and again, filling out each chilling detail piece by piece -- a shoe, the body of a victim, and soon, the victim's face. But when a shattering, real-life murder mirrors her creation, Sweeney is thrust into suspicious light. Now, with every stroke of her brush, she risks incriminating herself with her inexplicable knowledge of a deadly crime. And every desire -- including her hungry attraction to Richard -- is loaded with uncertainty and terrifying discovery as Sweeney races to unmask a killer.  With the breathless excitement that distinguishes all of her blockbusters of romantic suspense, Linda Howard grips the imagination and touches the heart as only she can in Now You See Her.",

To her amazement, her system works - and this time she meets the killer in person, not just on-line. When she discovers that the murderer is hooked into a secret network of people - gruesome killers like himself - who play an all-too realistic computer simulation game, she embarks on a personal quest that takes her far beyond the safe boundaries marked by warrants, Bureau procedure, and due process.Jay's presence on the network has alerted the man who invented this grisly game - a serial killer the Bureau has been hunting for nearly twenty years.

In response to public outcry, Gabriel Chin, special agent for the California Department of Justice, and forensic psychiatrist Leander Heartwood are ordered to conduct a \"psychiatric autopsy\" of Boggs to determine his motive and state of mind at the time of the attack. Their investigation leads them through Boggs's sordid history, his involvement with white supremacist groups, and his teenage years on the streets.But the trail takes an unexpected turn when they begin to suspect that Boggs was driven by something more than his inner demons. Following hunches, Chin and Heartwood are led to Boggs's half brother and then to Mace Weathers, outwardly a personable college student but in reality a man compelled by inner forces that may be more malevolent than the killer's. With the help of rural sheriff Phil Youngblood, evidence specialist Jean Sheldon, and Joyce DeLuca, a teacher and survivor of the massacre who must come to terms with the horror, Chin and Heartwood set out to unravel what really lay behind the crime. Along the way Chin encounters shocking realizations about his own violence and prejudices, while Heartwood confronts a disturbing truth: There are evils in the human spirit that psychiatry and medicine can neither explain nor cure.",

Violet is the dark one, dressed in forever black, dreaming Technicolor dreams of spinning the world into her very own silver screen creation. Claire is like a real-life Tinker Bell, radiating love and light, dressing herself in wings of gauze and glitter, writing poems to keep away the darkness. The setting is L.A., a city as beautiful as it is dangerous, and within this landscape of beauty and pain Violet and Claire vow to make their own movie. Together they will show the world the way they want it to be, and maybe then the world will become that place --a place where people no longer hate or fight or want to hurt. But when desire and ambition threaten to rip a seamless friendship apart, only one thing can make two halves whole again--the power of love.Francesca Lia Block's latest novel is a beautifully told story that boldly combines the world of film with the lyrical graceful language of poetry. The voices of two friends -- one dark, one light -- combine to tell a larger tale of love and loss, and the strength that comes from believing in dreams.2000 Quick Picks for Young Adults (Recomm.
