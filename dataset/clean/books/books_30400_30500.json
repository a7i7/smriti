        "Description": "First published in 1895, America's greatest novel\u00a0\u00a0of the Civil War was written before 21-year-old\u00a0\u00a0Stephen Crane had \"smelled even the powder of a\u00a0\u00a0sham battle.\" But this powerful psychological\u00a0\u00a0study of a young soldier's struggle with the\u00a0\u00a0horrors, both within and without, that war strikes the\u00a0\u00a0reader with its undeniable realism and with its\u00a0\u00a0masterful descriptions of the moment-by-moment riot\u00a0\u00a0of emotions felt by me under fire. Ernest\u00a0\u00a0Hemingway called the novel an American classic, and\u00a0\u00a0Crane's genius is as much apparent in his sharp,\u00a0\u00a0colorful prose as in his ironic portrayal of an episode\u00a0\u00a0of war so intense, so immediate, so real that the\u00a0\u00a0terror of battle becomes our own ... in a\u00a0\u00a0masterpiece so unique that many believe modern American\u00a0\u00a0fiction began with Stephen Crane.",

One of Cather's earliest novels, written in 1918, it is the story of \u00c1ntonia Shimerda, who arrives on the Nebraska frontier as part of a family of Bohemian emigrants. Her story is told through the eyes of Jim Burden, a neighbor who will befriend \u00c1ntonia, teach her English, and follow the remarkable story of her life.Working in the fields of waving grass and tall corn that dot the Great Plains, \u00c1ntonia forges the durable spirit that will carry her through the challenges she faces when she moves to the city. But only when she returns to the prairie does she recover her strength and regain a sense of purpose in life. In the quiet, probing depth of Willa Cather's art, \u00c1ntonia's story becomes a mobbing elegy to those whose persistence and strength helped build the American frontier.",

In a secluded woodland castle an old General prepares to receive a rare visitor, a man who was once his closest friend but who he has not seen in forty-one years.  Over the ensuing hours host and guest will fight a duel of words and silences, accusations and evasions. They will exhume the memory of their friendship and that of the General\u2019s beautiful, long-dead wife. And they will return to the time the three of them last sat together following a hunt in the nearby forest--a hunt in which no game was taken but during which something was lost forever. Embers is a classic of modern European literature, a work whose poignant evocation of the past also seems like a prophetic glimpse into the moral abyss of the present",

It is a joy to spend their days in the most exceptional library in the world, home to a precious and priceless Gutenberg Bible as well as yesterday's newspapers - 100 million items in all, including nearly 16 million books, 4 million maps, 41 million manuscript pages, 13 million photographs.For Paul Boswell, from 1936 when he was 23 years old until his retirement in 1984, it was his only place of employment (except for wartime military service) and the continuing inspiration for his poetry and his art. His poetry celebrates the life of a mind nurtured by the books and wisdom of Western civilization. His drawings capture the architecture, fountains, and courtyards of the Library, and other parts of Washington as well. Altogether, Boswell's work represents a unique view of a special place and the pursuit of learning.By the early 1950s, his drawings of the Library of Congress attracted attention from his colleagues and began, as a result, to appear in various library publications. About ten of them hang in the Government Publications Reading Room, one has appeared on the cover of Library Journal, and many of his annual Christmas cards featuring his drawings appear taped to walls and pinned on bulletin boards. The Columbia Historical Society of Washington, D.C., included a chapter of 18 Boswell pictures, \"A Portfolio of Washington Drawings,\" in its 1971-2 Record.The drawings and poetry that appear in this book were created over many years, frequently produced and changed during the creative day Paul Boswell began at three o'clock each morning, long before his regular workday began.",

        "Description": "Excellence in customer service is the hallmark of success in service industries and among manufacturers of products that require reliable service. But what exactly is excellent service? It is the ability to deliver what you promise, say the authors, but first you must determine what you can promise. Building on seven years of research on service quality, they construct a model that, by balancing a customer's perceptions of the value of a particular service with the customer's need for that service, provides brilliant theoretical insight into customer expectations and service delivery.For example, Florida Power & Light has developed a sophisticated, computer-based lightening tracking system to anticipate where weather-related service interruptions might occur and strategically position crews at these locations to quicken recovery response time. Offering a service that customers expect to be available at all times and that they will miss only when the lights go out, FPL focuses its energies on matching customer perceptions with potential need. Deluxe Corporation, America's highly successful check printer, regularly exceeds its customers' expectations by shipping nearly 95% of all orders by the day after the orders were received. Deluxe even put U.S. Postal Service stations inside its plants to speed up delivery time.Customer expectations change over time. To anticipate these changes, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company regularly monitors the expectations and perceptions of their customers, using focus group interviews and the authors' 22-item generic SERVQUAL questionnaire, which is customized by adding questions covering specific aspects of service they wish to track.The authors' groundbreaking model, which tracks the five attributes of quality service -- reliability, empathy, assurance, responsiveness, and tangibles -- goes right to the heart of the tendency to overpromise. By comparing customer perceptions with expectations, the model provides marketing managers with a two-part measure of perceived quality that, for the first time, enables them to segment a market into groups with different service expectations.",

        "Description": "This is a no-nonsense guide to the benefits and pitfalls of enterprise-wide information systems. How many organizations would doubt the promise of an integrated enterprise system (ES)? Not many, judging by a $15 billion industry. The combination of an ES as a platform for organizational information and Internet technology for gaining access to it adds up to the ideal solution for company-wide data sharing in real time. Not surprisingly, small and large companies worldwide are either considering an ES, in the process of implementing one, or living with the results. Yet, says Tom Davenport, unless managers view ES adoption and implementation as a business decision rather than a technology decision, they may be risking disappointment Mission Critical presents an authoritative and no-nonsense view of the ES opportunities and challenges. Suggesting ESs are not the right choice for every company, the author provides a set of guidelines to help managers evaluate the benefits and risks for their organizations. To be successful, argues Davenport, an organization must make simultaneous changes in its information systems, its business processes, and its business strategy. Such changes are described in detail with extensive examples from real organizations. Bolstering his contention that ESs should be viewed as business vs. technology projects, Davenport spells out the specific business change objectives that should be formulated in advance of ES adoption and monitored throughout its implementation. The first strategic guide to the ES decision, Mission Critical will be indispensable to general managers and information technology specialists at all stages of the implementation process.",

But now the wizard Karoly announced that he must make the journey there to seek advice from his witch-sister. For things hadn't been right in Maggiar this last season, not right at all...The princes Tamas and Bogdan were to go with Karoly, along with the huntsman Nikolai. Yuri, the youngest prince, chafed at being left behind. So when Tamas' dog chased after his master, Yuri followed. Soon the young prince had traveled far enough into the woods to wonder if he might not catch up with his brothers after all.His brothers had worries of their own. No sooner were they over-mountain, than their party was ambushed and scattered. The kingdoms they had come to find had all been ravaged. The goblins had declared war.Tamas, separated from the rest, fell in with Ela, a witch's apprentice. He found himself caught up in a battle of magic. For Ela held a shard broken off the goblin queen's mirror, a mere fragment that could wield a magic so strong and unpredictable that no other witch dared touch it. With this single sliver of magic, Ela planned to challenge the goblin queen herself...",

        "Description": "Discussed and debated from time immemorial, the concept of personal liberty went without codification until the 1859 publication of On Liberty. John Stuart Mill's complete and resolute dedication to the cause of freedom inspired this treatise, an enduring work through which the concept remains well known and studied.The British economist, philosopher, and ethical theorist's argument does not focus on \"the so-called Liberty of the Will\u2026but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.\" Mill asks and answers provocative questions relating to the boundaries of social authority and individual sovereignty. In powerful and persuasive prose, he declares that there is \"one very simple principle\" regarding the use of coercion in society \u2014 one may only coerce others either to defend oneself or to defend others from harm.The new edition offers students of political science and philosophy, in an inexpensive volume, one of the most influential studies on the nature of individual liberty and its role in a democratic society.",

        "Description": "\"Some people think that etiquette is fine for tea parties, but there's no room for it when important political business has to be done,\" writes Miss Manners, otherwise known as Judith Martin. \"That's not true. The more controversy you have, the more etiquette you need. You need rules and order.\" The missing ingredient in efforts to improve campaign discourse is a set of agreed-upon norms and standards for behavior.     In this shrewd and amusing series of observations, Stephen Hess provides a political etiquette for campaign behavior on the part of both politicians and journalists. Organized alphabetically under such headings as Advertising, Bias, Cyberpolitics, Disclosure, Families, Lying, Money, Sex Scandals, and Talk Radio, forty-three brief essays examine common practices and places where the system breaks down, then recommend preventive or corrective action through a few clear rules. After discussing the paucity of local television reporting on local and state political campaigns, for example, Hess comments, \"the etiquette for local news directors is to ask, 'If we are not reporting local elections, who will?' Then act accordingly.\" With its broad coverage of campaign-related topics and its sensible suggestions, this book provides a useful corrective for practices that are dishonest, downright illegal, or sometimes just endlessly irksome.     The book features illustrations by some of America's foremost political cartoonists, including Herblock, Jim Borgman, Walt Handelsman, Mike Peters, Wayne Stayskal, and Garry Trudeau.",

Eventually Nora Gallagher entered into a yearlong journey to discover herfaith and a relationship with God, using the Christian calendar as her compass.Whether writing about her brother's battle against cancer, talking to homeless men about the World Series, or questioning the afterlife (\"One worldat a time\"), Gallagher draws us into a world of journeys and mysteries, yet grounded in a gritty reality. She braids together the symbols of theChristian calendar, the events of a year in one church, and her own spiritual journey, each strand combed out with harrowing intimacy. Thought provoking and profoundly perceptive, Things Seen and Unseen is a remarkable demonstration that \"the road to the sacred is paved with the ordinary.\"\"Like Kathleen Norris in Amazing Grace, Gallagher is renewing the language of ultimate concerns.\"--San Francisco Chronicle\"The deep serenity that suffuses Gallagher's work, the lyrical cadences in which she writes, do not blunt the sharp edges of what she discovered in her quest for meaning.\"--Los Angeles Times",

The American embassy official assigned to her case, Tom Hurley, can't be bothered, entangled as he is in an unsavory love affair with the wife of a CIA officer. The neurotic Japanese cop in charge of the investigation, Kenzo Ota, is equally preoccupied, ridiculed by his peers, demeaned by his superiors, his life a lonely shambles. Worse, it appears that Lisa has disappeared into the shadow world of Tokyo's sex trade, where a bewildering and often comical variety of clubs cater to every imaginable male fantasy.The mystery of her disappearance is intertwined with the mystery of her origins as an ainoko, or half-breed. For Lisa, who is half African American and half Asian, alienation and belonging, love and hate, are bound up with race. All the characters' loyalties are divided - between their countries of origin and their adoptive nationalities, between their society's traditions and their own sense of justice - as they yearn to find where they truly belong.Country of Origin is an exploration of the meaning of identity and belonging.",

Orphaned and anchorless, Silver is taken in by blind Mr. Pew, the mysterious and miraculously old keeper of the Cape Wrath lighthouse. Pew tells Silver ancient tales of longing and rootlessness, of journeys that move through place and time, of passion and betrayal. His stories center on Babel Dark, a local nineteenth-century clergyman who lived two lives: a public one mired in darkness and a private one  bathed in a beacon of light. Pew's stories are, for Silver, a map through her own particular darkness, into her own story and, finally, into love. With Lighthousekeeping, Winterson begins a new cycle and a return to the lyrical intimacy of her earliest work. One of the most original and extraordinary writers of her generation, Winterson has created a modern fable about the transformative power of storytelling.",

For in these pages, Stanley Bing solves the ultimate problem of your working life: How to manage the boss. The technique is simple . . . as simple as throwing an elephant. All it takes is the proper state of mind, a step-by-step plan, and a great leap of faith. This humble guide provides all these and more. It is Zen that enables one to take an object of enormous weight and size and mold it in one's grasp like a ball of Silly Putty. For senior management, in truth, is the silliest putty of them all.This comprehensive course walks budding business bodhisattvas through basic skills needed to provide the simple elephant handling that makes everyday life possible, including but not limited to the primary task of following along after the elephant with a little broom and dustpan.Serious students will then move to intermediate steps, from Polishing the Elephant's Tusks to Hiding from the Elephant When It Has Been Drinking and Feels Quite Nasty. Beyond this level lies the land of the practiced Zen masters, culminating in the ability to leverage and then throw the now-weightless elephant--and even play catch with it at corporate retreats.If What Would Machiavelli Would Do? was the meanest business book since the Renaissance, Throwing the Elephant provides the yang to that yin. Because sometimes you've got to be selfless, compassionate, and completely empty to get the job done.",

        "Description": "Two Women Set Out Across Europe in Search of a Dead Queen  The medieval queen in question is Constance of Hauteville, daughter of the Norman King Roger II of Sicily, wife of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, and mother to the Emperor Frederick II.  In 1194, at the age of forty, Constance journeyed from Germany south to reconquer her father's throne.  On the way she discovered that she was pregnant for the first time.  She decided to give birth in public so that the world would know the child was truly hers.  These intriguing facts, and very few others, are all we know directly of Constance's life. Seventeen years ago, Mary Taylor Simeti promised in  On Persephone's Island --her now-classic memoir of an American in Sicily--that she would someday tell the story of Constance (who was, like her, an expatriate and the mother of a bicultural family).  In  Travels with a Medieval Queen , Simeti keeps her promise: retracing Constance's route from Germany to Sicily, contrasting the exotic setting of Constance's childhood in Palermo with that of her married life in the north, and drawing on reading in contiguous fields to flesh out a spare legacy of historical facts. This is the beautifully illustrated chronicle of Simeti's twentieth-century travels, first in books, then on the road, as she searches the landscapes and the monuments that survive from the twelfth century for clues to the inner life of a mother who was also a monarch.",

In his provocative new book, The Human Equation, bestselling author Jeffrey Pfeffer examines why much of the current conventional wisdom is wrong and asks us to re-think the way managers link people with organizational performance. Pfeffer masterfully builds a powerful business case for managing people effectively&#151;not just because it makes for good corporate policy, but because it results in outstanding performance and profits. Challenging current thinking and practice, Pfeffer: reveals the costs of downsizing and provides alternatives; identifies troubling trends in compensation, and suggests better practices; explains why even the smartest managers sometimes manage people unwisely; demonstrates how market-based forces can fail to create good people management practices, creating a need for positive public policy; and provides practical guidelines for implementing high-performance management practices. Filled with information and ideas, The Human Equation provides much-needed guidance for managing people more wisely and more profitably.",

        "Description": "Until recently, the study of sex roles, sexual behavior, and the differences between the sexes came under the aegis of such disciplines as psychiatry, sociology, or medicine. Love and Love Sickness lays the groundwork for an emerging, independent area of study, that of sexology. It is the newest, most provocative work yet from John Money, a medical psychologist whose distinguished contributions to sex research have gained him an international reputation.Money leads the reader through a fascinating array of topics relating to differences between the sexes, from, as he says, \"making a baby to learning mathematics.\" Among his subjects are the behavior of the sexes as seen throughout history; irreducible, derivative, and arbitrary sex roles; how men and women differ in aggression and dominance, parenting, and in mathematical, verbal, and praxic reasoning ; principles of erotic sexuality; the pathology of love; sexual taboos in Western culture; pornography; and, in an appendix, the treatment of sex offenders.Drawing upon history, ethnology, psychology, sociology, and law, as well as physiology, endocrinology, embryology, genetics, and host of other fields, Money proposes a new basis for understanding sexual behavior. He rejects the older analytic devices of motivation theory and the dichotomies of mind/body and nature/nurture to offer instead a theory that acknowledges a number of variables contributing to individual and collective behavior.Professionals and students in sex education, mental health, psychiatry, and clinical psychology, human biology, and counseling will find Love and Love Sickness, like all of John Money's work, necessary reading. It is also a book for the educated layperson, who will find it replete with insights into the realm of human sexuality.",

        "Title": "A Twist of Lemmon: A Tribute to My Father",
        "Authors": "By Lemmon, Chris",
        "Description": "Jack Lemmon was one of our most beloved movie stars. A two-time Academy Award winner, he appeared in dozens of memorable films, including such classics as Some Like It Hot, Mister Roberts, The Odd Couple, Grumpy Old Men, Missing, The Apartment, and The China Syndrome. On-screen, he came across as a kind of \"everyman\"\u2014audiences loved him because they felt they knew him, because he was on of them. In A Twist of Lemmon, Chris Lemmon shares family tales, intimate father-son conversations, and anecdotes from and about his dad. The result is a vivid and enchanting portrait of a less-than-perfect father who in some ways assumed a greater reality for his fans than he did for his son. Chris writes about the difficulty of growing up in a broken home, the treasured time spent with his father, and the friendship that evolved as they came to share their passions for both music and golf. This very personal portrait provides new insight into a man who charmed millions with his rascal's smile and his very human vulnerability. When Jack Lemmon died in 2001, the world lost one of its favorite actors, but Chris Lemmon lost the man he had admired above all others. A Twist of Lemmon is his warm and moving and often very funny celebration of his larger-than-life father.  Joining Chris in his tribute are a number of the people who worked with Jack Lemmon over thy years, including actor Kevin Spacey. In his foreword, Spacey writes, \"He was a credit to his profession because he was a man whose humanity was bigger than his talent. And when you think for a moment about the size and depth of that talent, then you begin to understand how seriously he took his role as a human being.\" In this first book of its kind written about Jack Lemmon, that \"human being\" comes fully alive\u2014as an actor, a father, and a best friend. It is a heartwarming and discerning  look at a true American legend.",

        "Description": "From the Revolutionary War to the present, the American military has consistently beaten the odds. It\u2019s not luck. America\u2019s armed services are under attack. From college campuses to the floor of the Senate, the Iraq war is portrayed as a quagmire, the army is described as \"broken,\" and our men and women in uniform are maligned as torturers. By seeing everything through the distorted lens of Vietnam?a war shrouded in harmful myths? critics have lost sight of our country\u2019s real military record, and the factors that have enabled us to win with remarkable consistency, in situations even more dire than Iraq. In America\u2019s Victories, Professor Larry Schweikart restores the truth about our amazing military heritage. Just as he did in his acclaimed previous book, A Patriot\u2019s History of the United States, Professor Schweikart cuts through the distortions passed along by academia and the media. Far from being a cruel, bloodthirsty nation, eager to acquire other people\u2019s resources, American troops value the sanctity of life more than any military culture in history. This fundamental trait has led, over the last two centuries, to more humane treatment of prisoners, more daring POW rescues, and more effective operations than any comparable power. America\u2019s Victories explains how this culture of victory has endured through the darkest moments of World War II, the Korean and Vietnam wars, and how it has helped our troops prove their critics wrong over and over, from the Battle of New Orleans under Andrew Jackson to the war in Afghanistan under Tommy Franks.",

Drawing on the biblical chronicle of David\u2019s life as well as on the later commentaries and the Psalms\u2014traditionally considered to be David\u2019s own words\u2014Pinsky teases apart the many strands of David\u2019s story and reweaves them into a glorious narrative.Under the clarifying and captivating light of Pinsky\u2019s erudition and imagination, and his mastery of image and expression, King David\u2014both the man and the idea of the man\u2014is brought brilliantly to life.",

Now, in Susie Coelho's Everyday Styling, she offers a liberating plan for infusing personal style into readers' home and gardens, often without spending a dime.  Susie's credo is that the most appealing spaces are usually not the most expensive or decorator-correct. Homes develop authentic personal styles the same way people do -- through creativity, change, and the process of living. But how do you develop your own sense of style? Susie will show you how to find it, define it, and put it to use. The secret is the Style File: She'll help you create a collection of looks you love (pictures, swatches of material, scribbled ideas), organized as a practical reference for every space in your home and garden. As you discover common threads and new possibilities, your own vision will start to take shape.  But do you have the time or the resources to bring this vision to life? As a wife and mother juggling the demands of family, career, social life, and community, Susie understands the obstacles -- and how to work around them. The aim is to start with what you already have, then rearrange, refresh, and add unexpected or missing elements to create a new look all your own. It's not formal decorating or landscaping according to someone else's rules; it's a personal process that Susie calls \"un-decorating\" -- or everyday styling.  Filled with gorgeous color photographs, styling how-to's and tips, and lots of inspiration, Everyday Styling helps readers on any budget wake up their homes and gardens while putting their unique thumbprint on everything they do. You'll be able to create a whole new look and mood -- using pillows or fabric to jazz up old furniture, displaying and highlighting favorite possessions, or redoing a living room in three different ways -- all in one day.  Moving outside, Susie offers tips on styling entrances according to the season, creating fantastic outdoor rooms for entertaining or play, and turning your yard into a garden of earthly delights. At every step, she helps you develop and draw on your most important resources -- your own imagination, creativity, and passion for living. Whether you're entertaining friends, hankering for a new perspective on that same old bedroom, or just hoping to perk up your patio with colorful plants, Susie Coelho's Everyday Styling shows how easy it is to keep you home and garden looking and feeling fresh and alive every day. Her message is simple but universal: Keep creating. That's the joy of life.",
