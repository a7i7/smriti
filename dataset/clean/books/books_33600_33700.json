We are being warned today--by enemies like Iran, North Korea, and radicals and terrorists across the globe--but we are still not listening.Sounding the alarm is bestselling author Jed Babbin (former deputy undersecretary of defense), who exposes the demagogues, dictators, and death squads openly threatening America--with potentially devastating consequences, if we aren't alert to the danger.Full of stunning detail, In the Words of Our Enemies reveals:* What the Islamists themselves are saying about their plans for America--mass murder followed by imposition of Islamic sharia law* How Venezuela's Hugo Chavez is leading a radical anti-American revolution that aims to organize the world's oil supplies against America* Why China's plans go beyond regional hegemony to driving the United States out of the Pacific* How even so-called \"friendly\" countries, like Russia, are conspiring against us* How many countries have threatened to use nuclear weapons against America (it's more than you think)Highlighting our enemies' own words, Jed Babbin gives you, the reader, an insider's intelligence report on the dangers we face. In the Words of Our Enemies gives you the knowledge you need to be forewarned and forearmed in defending America.",

        "Authors": "By Schwarzkopf, H. Norman and Petre, Peter",
        "Description": "In this candid, eagerly awaited autobiography General H. Norman Schwarzkopf reveals the story of his remarkable life and career. Here is the story of his boyhood years during World War II and a unique adolescence spent in the Middle East and Europe that would later prove invaluable to his understanding of the Gulf. Here, too, is a frank account of the West Point graduate's early disillusionment with the \"real\" Army - a disappointment that nearly prompted him to leave the military.General Schwarzkopf speaks openly about his two tours of duty in Vietnam. He recounts the \"dark years\" that followed, and his own role in the struggle to reform the military.For the first time ever General Schwarzkopf provides his personal, behind-the-scenes account of Desert Shield/Desert Storm, including candid portraits of such major figures as Colin Powell, Richard Cheney and President George Bush. From the general's unique perspective we experience firsthand the complexities of coordinating the campaign in a country deeply suspicious of foreigners; of maintaining strategic secrecy during America's first internationally televised war; and of ensuring that this war would not be another Vietnam.Thoughtful and provocative, It Doesn't Take a Hero is an intensely personal portrait of an American life, the triumphant journey of a soldier who set his star by a simple but timeless motto: duty, honor, and country.",

Every attempt to contact survivors met with a devastating silence. Now the unknown force is back - and this time humanity's only hope for survival lies on Dinadh...with a woman who'd give anything not to get involved.Lutha Tallstaff is a brilliant linguist, a devoted mother, and a reluctant emissary to Dinadh.

Faithful and True offers a path that leads beyond compulsive thoughts and behaviors toward sexual integrity and self-control. Sensitive to the shame of sexual addiction without minimizing its sinfulness, Dr. Mark Laaser: - traces the roots of sexual addiction in families and in culture - shows how sexual sin poisons the lives of pastors and laypeople alike - provides a complete 12-step program for treatment and recovery from sexual addiction. You may be the spouse, pastor, family member, or friend of someone with a sexual addiction. Of you yourself may struggle with urges you&apos;ve not been able to overcome. Regardless, hope and help are at hand. Faithful and True steers you over the rocky but navigable road to understanding, wholeness, and holiness.",

        "Title": "My Tibet, Text by his Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet",
        "Authors": "By Dalai Lama XIV and Rowell, Galen",
        "Description": "One of the world's spiritual leaders and a renowned wilderness photographer combine their vision of Tibet in this stunningly beautiful book. Essays by the Fourteenth Dalai Lama appear with Galen Rowell's dramatic images in a moving presentation of the splendors of Tibet's revered but threatened heritage.When Chinese communist troops invaded Tibet in 1950, the author was fifteen years old and the spiritual and temporal ruler of a nation the size of western Europe. Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, appealed to the United Nations for help and then fled across the Himalaya in winter to a border town, where he anxiously awaited political aid that never came.Like the mythical kingdom of Shangri-La, Tibet had sought isolation from the rest of the world. Diplomatic relations and foreign visitors had been shunned, and few people in the West knew what cultural and natural treasures lay threatened there. In the years that followed, the Dalai Lama struggled to maintain peace in Tibet and to protect his people's ways, but in 1959 he was forced to flee to India, where he remains today. There he has established a government in exile in Dharamsala that has endeavored to preserve Tibetan culture while preparing for a peaceful return to a free Tibet.As the Chinese cautiously opened select Tibetan doors to visitors in the 1980s, a sickening realization stole over the rest of the world: Tibet had been ravaged by the Chinese occupation. All but a dozen of Tibet's six thousand monasteries had been destroyed.Much of the once-bountiful wildlife had disappeared. A sixth of the population had perished. The picture seemed so bleak that many wondered whether there was anything worth saving in this wounded land.The Dalai Lama's heartening answer and Galen Rowell's magnificent photographs leave no doubt that the mystery and enchantment of Tibet, though seriously endangered, are still alive. To Tibetans the Dalai Lama is an incarnation of the Buddha of compassion. He has spent the last thirty years tirelessly advocating nonviolence and compassion to all living things as the answer to Tibet's plight. \"My religion is simple,\" he says, \"my religion is kindness.\"My Tibet movingly elaborates this message: here the Dalai Lama offers his views on how world peace, happiness, and environmental responsibility are inextricably linked. He explains the meaning of pilgrimage for Tibetan Buddhists and gives an engaging account of his early life in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. In addition, he reveals many sides to his nature&#151;compassion, profound faith, common sense, generosity, a playful sense of humor&#151;in personal reflections matched here to 108 photographs of the land he hasn't seen since 1959. Together the breathtaking photographs, which express Rowell's own commitment to the natural world, and the Dalai Lama's observations help preserve the enduring meaning of Tibet's culture, religion, and natural heritage.",

        "Description": "Generations of children have roamed the English countryside in the company of Rat, Mole, Toad, and Badger, the immortal animal friends of The Wind in the Willows. From their genesis nearly a century ago as bedtime stories for the author's young son, these timeless tales of friendship amid the natural world have captivated readers of all ages.The adventures begin when Mole, feeling all the restlessness that springtime brings, abandons his burrow to discover the magic of the great river. With the able assistance of Rat, Mole learns to row and swim, and the chums fill their idyllic days with summertime rambles along the river and cozy fireside feasts on crisp nights. The pair take to the open road with the pleasure-loving Toad, track reclusive Badger to his snug lair, and stand together to reclaim Toad Hall from an invasion of stoats, ferrets, and weasels.This memorable collection of stories, now available in an inexpensive and unabridged edition, offers a joyful retreat to a rustic world of wonders. Young readers (and listeners) will want to return again and again to the ageless charm of Kenneth Grahame's childhood classic.",

This book is a celebration of color in interior design, a richly inspiring book of design ideas and solutions.Tricia Guild has a unique understanding of the many ways in which color works in decoration. Her internationally renowned collections for Designers Guild and her experience as an innovative stylist are testament to her unique color sense. In the introductory section of the book, A Sense of Color, Tricia Guild examines color theory as well as the scope and potential of color in decoration. Seven individual chapters then take a detailed look at the color families--white, blue, green, yellow, natural, terracotta and red--analyzing specific examples, providing color boards for interiors created specially for the book and giving examples and suggestions for color combinations and contrasts. Finally, Tricia provides a section of color palettes, an easy reference to each color family as well as a guide to choosing her special colorways.Tricia Guild suggests ways of using color to lend energy and warmth to an interior, ways of combining shades, shows how light, scale and proportion can affect a color and demonstrates how color can be introduced into a room by means of objects and soft furnishings. Forget the stale color schemes of pastelshades or off-white and the safe solutions of plain fabrics. Instead, experiment with a glorious palette of aquamarine, sharp lime, cornflower blue and glowing primrose yellow. Once you have introduced color into your surroundings you will never be able to live without it.",

        "Description": "For pure exhilaration and drama, there's nothing quite like sports: It's the crack of the bat as it connects with the baseball, hurtling it into the bleachers for a home run; the swish of the basketball as it drops into the net for a three-point play at the buzzer; the roar of the crowd as the quarterback delivers a perfect spiral pass for the winning touchdown. Most importantly, sports bring out the best in the human spirit. There is an intensity and a richness inherent in every sporting experience that amplifies our emotions and our connection with the moment and, indeed, with ourselves.This latest collection of Chicken Soup honors all that is good in the world of sports. From major leaguers to little leaguers, from hockey stars to figure skaters, and from horseracing to mushing, the stories in this book highlight the positive and transformative nature of sports. Readers will come to see sports as one of our most important and powerful teachers. They can teach us to focus and stay the course, or to develop a new strategy and rededicate ourselves to a goal. They can teach us to be humble in victory and gracious in defeat. They can teach us the importance of teamwork and remind us that we must strive to give our individual all. At their best, sports will build us up and they will wear us down; they will build character and teach us to overcome adversity.This book is for anyone who has ever enjoyed watching or participating in any sport, from the professional athlete to the weekend warrior, from the soccer mom to the diehard sports fan, from the marathon runner to the neighborhood jogger.",
