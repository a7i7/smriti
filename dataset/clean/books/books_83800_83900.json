The woman who emerges from these pages is a complex figure\u2014heroic, driven . . . and entirely human.\u201d\u2014Richard Bernstein, The New York TimesPassionate Nomad captures the momentous life and times of Freya Stark with precision, compassion, and marvelous detail. Hailed by The Times of London as \u201cthe last of the Romantic Travellers\u201d upon her death in 1993, Freya Stark combined unflappable bravery, formidable charm, fearsome intellect, and ferocious ambition to become the twentieth century\u2019s best-known woman traveler. Digging beneath the mythology, Geniesse uncovers a complex, controversial, and quixotic woman whose indomitable spirit was forged by contradictions: a child of privilege, Stark grew up in near poverty; yearning for formal education, she was largely self-taught; longing for love, she consistently focused on the wrong men. Despite these hardships, Stark\u2019s astonishing career spanned more than sixty years, during which she produced twenty-two books that sealed her reputation as a consummate woman of letters. This edition includes a new Epilogue by the author that, citing newly discovered evidence, calls into question the circumstances of Stark\u2019s birth and adds new insight into this adventurous and lively personality.Praise for Passionate Nomad\u201cPassionate Nomad is a work of nonfiction that reads and sings with the drama and lilt of a fine novel. The story of Freya Stark is stunning, inspiring, sad, funny, unique, and moving. Jane Fletcher Geniesse tells it straight, but with a care for delicious detail and a sympathy for the characters that make this a truly special book.\u201d\u2014Jim Lehrer\u201cPassionate Nomad supplies a fascinating individual thread in the tapestry of twentiethcentury Middle Eastern history. . . . [Geniesse] has achieved, in the end, an admirable focus, at once critical and sympathetic. . . . For all Stark\u2019s unresolved contradictions, . . . her distinction as a latter-day woman of letters survives.\u201d\u2014The New York Times Book Review \u201cCompulsively readable . . . [Geniesse] has done a thorough job re-creating the life of a woman many consider to be the last of the great romantic travelers.\u201d\u2014The Plain Dealer (Cleveland)",

A lyrical novel that recalls his fully lived life, Old Filth has been acclaimed as Jane Gardam?s masterpiece, a book where life and art merge. And now that beautiful, haunting novel has been joined by a companion that also bursts with humor and wisdom: The Man in the Wooden Hat. Old Filth was Eddie?s story. The Man in the Wooden Hat is the history of his marriage told from the perspective of his wife, Betty, a character as vivid and enchanting as Filth himself. They met in Hong Kong after the war. Betty had spent the duration in a Japanese internment camp. Filth was already a successful barrister, handsome, fast becoming rich, in need of a wife but unaccustomed to romance. A perfect English couple of the late 1940s. As a portrait of a marriage, with all the bittersweet secrets and surprising fulfillment of the 50-year union of two remarkable people, the novel is a triumph. The Man in the Wooden Hat is fiction of a very high order from a great novelist working at the pinnacle of her considerable power. It will be read and loved and recommended by all the many thousands of readers who found its predecessor, Old Filth, so compelling and so thoroughly satisfying.",

Once those are understood, all the rest flows smoothly--what distinguishes the colors and types, how to match wine with food, how to store and serve it, and even how much to spend on a bottle. St. Pierre's sensible approach combined with stunning photographs and elegant maps of the world's great wine-growing regions make this the perfect no-nonsense guide or lovely gift for anyone who wants to learn to understand, appreciate, and, above all, fully enjoy the fruit of the vine.",

        "Description": "In Investigating Disease Patterns, noted scientists Paul Stolley and Tamar Lasky show us how epidemiologists go about investigating the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases and, also, how they are tackling the greatest health threats of our time: heart disease, cancer, and environmental and occupational illnesses. Beginning with an historical overview, the authors trace the growth of epidemiology, from the recording of symptoms and the counting of events in the seventeenth century, to the development of a powerful investigative method used to uncover the sources not only of infectious diseases, with their simple origin in a pathogenic microorganism, but also diseases, like cancer, of more complicated origin and many contributing factors. They describe in fascinating detail how, like a detective, the modern epidemiologist pursues the answers to crucial questions about who becomes ill, then applies scientific tools such as statistical analysis and controlled trials to verify those answers. In so doing, epidemiologists both find ways to stop specific outbreaks of disease and deepen our understanding of the disease process.Stolley and Lasky also show how epidemiology has moved beyond its exploration of the biological causes of disease, to study the workings of the health care system itself - to evaluate what works and what doesn't, from a public health campaign such as advertising to encourage the use of seat belts, to a surgical procedure, or a screening test such as mammography.",

The author helps readers value their own questions and learn to talk about spiritual matters in fresh, non-religious language. Rather than handing down doctrines \"from above,\" Groff invites readers to look at life \"from below,\" exploringexperiences of daily living. He helps the reader to find the grace in the grit of everyday life, seeking analogies of faith in film and literature, psychology and science, poetry and arts, music and sports. Drawing primarily from the well of his Christian experience, Groff also incorporates insights from the world's primal myths and major religions.Fifty reflection exercises make it ideal for group use with journeyers of varied backgrounds for campuses, prisons, communal residences, religious communities and work places.",

        "Description": "Publisher's description: In this remarkable tour of the Catholic world, George Weigel helps us understand how Catholicism fosters what Flannery O'Connor called \"the habit of being.\" Taking the reader by the hand, Weigel embarks on a journey to Catholic landmarks as diverse as Chartres Cathedral and St. Mary's Church in Greenville, South Carolina; the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem and G.K. Chesterton's favorite pub; the grave of a modern martyr in Warsaw, and the Sistine Chapel. Weaving together insights from history, literature, theology, and music, Weigel uses these touchstones to illuminate the beliefs that have shaped Catholicism for two thousand years. With clarity and conviction, Weigel examines the foundations of Catholic faith and explores the topics of grace, prayer, vocation, sin and forgiveness, suffering, and-most importantly-love. Putting a dramatic face on this invitation to Catholicism, Weigel introduces some of the figures who have shaped his faith and thought-Michelangelo and Fra Angelico; Evelyn Waugh and Cardinal John Henry Newman; Father Jerzy Popieuszko and Pope John Paul II; Edith Stein and Mother Teresa-as he also shares anecdotes from his own Catholic life. To a world that sometimes seems closed and claustrophobic, he suggests, Christian humanism offers a world with windows and doors-and a skylight. In these letters, George Weigel conveys the power of a faith that is at once personal and universal, timely and eternal. His book will inspire not only the young generation of Catholics whose World Youth Day celebrations have launched an era of renewal for the Church, but also the faithful, the doubtful, and the searchers of every age.",

        "Title": "Broke: The Plan to Restore Our Trust, Truth and Treasure",
        "Authors": "By Beck, Glenn, Balfe, Kevin, Nunn, Paul E. (ILT), Schweizer, Peter (CON), and Grimm, Tyler (CON)",
        "Description": "Nationally syndicated radio host Glenn Beck deploys his wildly distinctive humor to take on the political landscape.THE FACTS. THE FUTURE. THE FIGHT TO FIX AMERICA\u2014BEFORE IT\u2019S TOO LATE.  In the words of Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, the United States is \u201can empire on the edge of chaos.\u201d Why? Glenn Beck thinks the answer is pretty simple: Because we\u2019ve turned our backs on the Constitution.  Yes, our country is financially broke, but that\u2019s just a side effect of our broken spirit, our broken faith in government, the broken promises by our leaders, and a broken political system that has centralized power at the expense of individual rights.  There is a lot of work ahead, but we can\u2019t move forward until we first understand how we got here. Starting with the American Revolution, Glenn takes readers on an express train through 234 years of history, culminating with the Great Recession and the bipartisan recklessness of Presidents Bush and Obama. It\u2019s the history lesson we all wished we\u2019d had in school. (Did you know, for example, that FDR once made a key New Deal policy decision based on his lucky number?)  Along the way, you\u2019ll see how everything you thought you knew about the political parties is a lie, how Democrats and Republicans alike used to fight for minimum government and maximum freedom, and how both parties have been taken over by a cancer called \u201cprogressivism.\u201d By the end, you\u2019ll understand why no president, no congress and no court can fix this problem alone. Looking toward them for answers is like looking toward the ocean for drinking water\u2014 it looks promising, but the end result is catastrophic.  After revealing the trail of lies that brought us here, Broke exposes the truth about what we\u2019re really facing. Most people have seen pieces of the puzzle, but very few have ever seen the whole picture\u2014and for very good reason: Our leaders have done everything in their power to hide it. If Americans understood how dire things really are, they would be demanding radical reform right now. Despite the rhetoric, that\u2019s not the kind of change our politicians really believe in.  Finally, Broke provides the hope that comes with knowing the truth. Once you see what we\u2019re really up against, it\u2019s much easier to develop a realistic plan. To fix ourselves financially, Glenn argues, we have to fix ourselves first. That means some serious introspection and, ultimately, a series of actions that will unite all Americans around the concept of shared sacrifice. After all, this generation may not be asked to storm beaches, but we are being asked to do something just as critical to preserving freedom.  Packed with great stories from history, chalkboard-style teachable moments, custom illustrations, and Glenn Beck\u2019s trademark combination of entertainment and enlightenment, Broke makes the case that when you\u2019re traveling in the wrong direction, slight course corrections won\u2019t cut it\u2014you need to take drastic action. Through a return to individual rights, an uncompromising adherence to the Constitution, and a complete rethinking about the role of government in a free society, Glenn exposes the idea of \u201ctransformation\u201d for the progressive smokescreen that it is, and instead builds a compelling case that restoration is the only way forward.",
