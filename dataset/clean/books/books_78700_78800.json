        "Title": "The Joy of Being 50 Plus",
        "Authors": "By Zobel-Nolan, Allia and Chast, Roz (ILT)",
        "Description": "The baby boomers are turning 50 - one by one, at the alarming rate of every seven seconds for the next 16 years. And just how many will be happily looking forward to blowing out a galaxy of candles and admitting to the world that they're half a century old? Very few, in Allia Zobel's opinion. But that's because they're not looking on the bright side.In a new collaboration after The Joy of Being Single (138,000 copies in print), Ms. Zobel and New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast take on another seemingly sore subject - being 50 in society that worships youth - and find excellent reasons to celebrate. Such as: -You can get a tattoo and chalk it up to hormone imbalance. -You can brag to your friends if a construction worker whistles at you. -You can have complaining contests about your bunions. -You look divine in hats and sunglasses. -You're old enough to be a grouch. -You can speak from experience. -You now know the things you wish you'd known back when, and still have time to do something about it. And while neither Ms. Zobel nor Ms. Chast is anywhere near the magic five-oh (it's the fluorescent lighting), they speak with authority as they advise all 50-year-olds to blow their own horn (if they have enough wind) and beat their own drum (arthritis permitting).",

        "Title": "Liberating the Adult Within: Moving from Childlike Responses to Authentic Adulthood",
        "Authors": "By Kramer, Helen",
        "Description": "Life's not perfect? Things don't always go your way? Feeling completely out of control of your life? Don't lose hope. There is good news!Psychotherapist Helen Kramer has developed a pioneering method that provides long-term solutions for people who generally function well, but have difficulty ridding their behavior of unpredictable childlike responses such as rigidity, blame, impatience, and melodrama.Helen Kramer has invented the phrase \"emotional dyslexia\" to cover those times when you didn't behave the way you would have liked. Think of it this way: if people who have trouble learning have dyslexia, then people who have trouble learning to be authentic adults have emotional dyslexia.Kramer uses an educational process that goes beyond that of traditional psychotherapy to focus on what you can do to change unwanted behavior - without years of analysis. So if, after all the Twelve Step programs and the endless years on the couch you still feel insecure, fearful or less comfortable in the world than you would wish, Liberating the Adult Within: Moving from Childish Responses to Authentic Adulthood is the book for you.Helen Kramer identifies different childlike states such as dependency and fear and gives examples of typical ways of reacting to different situations while in these states. By supplementing examples of each behavior with anecdotes, very specific dialogues, and key words and phrases, such as \"I'm too fat,\" \"It's my fault,\" or \"Nobody loves me,\" she enables you to identify which childlike state you may be in, recognize its adult counterpart, and move on to change your behavior. The approach is nonjudgmental, and each chapter includes exercises and an inspirational message to help motivate you.Whether the stress factor is created by your boss, spouse, or parent, Liberating the Adult Within will teach you how to deal with any situation without feeling threatened or confined. You'll learn to accept differences in others, forgive your parents for past mistakes, and become a better parent to your children. You will finally become the adult that you've always been, but were unable to free.",

        "Description": "Most of us think of inflammation as a symptom associated with an infection or injury. Dr. Nancy Appleton, however, has discovered that it might be more than just a simple reaction to a health disorder. When the body\u2019s tissues are disturbed in some manner, a series of complex reactions takes place, resulting in inflammation. In most cases, when the disorder stops, the tissue returns to its normal healthy state. Sometimes, though, the tissue remains chronically inflamed. Dr. Appleton\u2019s research demonstrates that this condition might be more harmful than ever suspected.Drawing on the latest medical research, Stopping Inflammation begins with a full explanation of inflammation and its causes. It then looks at inflammation\u2019s role in various health disorders, from obesity to cancer. Finally, the book provides a number of nondrug treatments aimed not at controlling the problem, but at removing its cause. Here are safe and credible solutions for restoring good health.",

        "Title": "At Peace with All Their Neighbors: Catholics and Catholicism in the National Capital, 1787-1860 (Not In A Series)",
        "Authors": "By Warner, William W.",
        "Description": "In 1790, two events marked important points in the development of two young American institutions -- Congress decided that the new nation's seat of government would be on the banks of the Potomac, and John Carroll of Maryland was consecrated as America's first Catholic bishop. This coincidence of events signalled the unexpectedly important role that Maryland's Catholics, many of them by then fifth- and sixth-generation Americans, were to play in the growth and early government of the national capital. In this book, William W. Warner explores how Maryland's Catholics drew upon their long-standing traditions -- advocacy of separation of church and state, a sense of civic duty, and a determination \"to live at peace with all their neighbors,\" in Bishop Carroll's phrase -- to take a leading role in the early government, financing, and building of the new capital.Beginning with brief histories of the area's first Catholic churches and the establishment of Georgetown College,At Peace with All Their Neighbors explains the many reasons behind the Protestant majority's acceptance of Catholicism in the national capital in an age often marked by religious intolerance. Shortly after the capital moved from Philadelphia in 1800, Catholics held the principal positions in the city government and were also major landowners, property investors, and bankers. In the decade before the 1844 riots over religious education erupted in Philadelphia, the municipal government of Georgetown gave public funds for a Catholic school and Congress granted land in Washington for a Catholic orphanage.The book closes with a remarkable account of how the Washington community, Protestants and Catholics alike, withstood the concentrated efforts of the virulently anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic American nativists and the Know-Nothing Party in the last two decades before the Civil War.This chronicle of Washington's Catholic community and its major contributions to the growth of the nations's capital will be of value for everyone interested in the history of Washington, D.C., Catholic history, and the history of religious toleration in America.",

Collectively dubbed ?Peking Man,? they were one of the most important finds in the history of paleontology. And in 1941, in the chaos of World War II they disappeared. No one knows what happened, but there are plenty of theories, many with political implications. Claire Taschdjian?s speculation as to what might have become of the priceless fossils could represent just another theory, but for one intriguing fact: Claire Taschdjian was one of the last people in the world known to have seen Peking Man.

        "Description": "The religious and political winds are changing. Tens of millions of religious Americans are reclaiming faith from those who would abuse it for narrow, partisan, and ideological purposes. And more and more secular Americans are discovering common ground with believers on the great issues of social justice, peace, and the environment. In Souled Out, award-winning journalist and commentator E. J. Dionne explains why the era of the Religious Right--and the crude exploitation of faith for political advantage--is over.  Based on years of research and writing, Souled Out shows that the end of the Religious Right doesn't signal the decline of evangelical Christianity but rather its disentanglement from a political machine that sold it out to a narrow electoral agenda of such causes as opposition to gay marriage and abortion. With insightful portraits of leading contemporary religious figures from Rick Warren and Richard Cizik to John Paul II and Benedict XVI, Dionne shows that our great religions have always preached a broad message of hope for more just human arrangements and refused to be mere props for the powers that be. Dionne also argues that the new atheist writers should be seen as a gift to believers, a demand that they live up to their proclaimed values and embrace scientific and philosophical inquiry in a spirit of \"intellectual solidarity.\"  Written in the tradition of Reinhold and H. Richard Niebuhr, Souled Out will help change how we think and talk about religion and politics in the post-Bush era.",

        "Description": "Destined to take its place beside such classics of speculative fiction as 1984, Brave New World, and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, this astonishing first novel is a beautifully written and riveting meditation on what it means to be human, what it means to live, and love, wholeheartedly. The year is 2071. In the United States, the only nation in the world where human cloning is legal, a government-run cloning program is in place as the lynchpin of the health care delivery system. Almost every U.S. citizen has a \u201cCopy\u201d living in a sequestered area called The Clearances. When an \u201cOriginal\u201d is sick or injured and requires surgery, whatever he needs is taken from his clone. In the two decades since the program\u2019s inception, no person has ever seen his Copy, and no clone has ever successfully escaped. Until now. A widower in his sixties, and an unlikely candidate for adventure, Ray gets a call from a woman he has not seen or spoken to since their days together as students. Anna is now a member of an underground abolitionist group, and she asks Ray\u2019s help in hiding an escaped clone. Ray is unwilling, until he learns the clone is his.The Bradbury Report is Ray\u2019s account of the journey he, Anna, and his clone \u2013 a perfect replica of himself at twenty-one \u2013 undertake on the run from the authorities. It is an epic journey, and an exploration of one of the most pressing ethical dilemmas of the twenty-first century. A provocative vision of the American future, and a haunting story of love and friendship and self-discovery, The Bradbury Report will stay with you long after reading.",

Two options for meeting the upcoming challenge are dramatic improvements in home energy efficiency and efforts to tap into clean, affordable, renewable energy resources to heat and cool homes, to provide hot water and electricity, and even to cook. These measures can result in huge savings and a level of energy independence.The Homeowner\u2019s Guide to Renewable Energy tells you how. It starts by outlining the likely impacts of fossil fuel shortages and some basic facts about energy. It then discusses energy conservation to slash energy bills and prepare for renewable energy options. Focusing carefully on specific strategies needed to replace specific fuels, the book then examines each practical energy option available to homeowners:\u2022 Solar hot water, cooking, and water purification \u2022 Space heat: passive and active solar retrofits \u2022 Wood heat \u2022 Passive cooling \u2022 Solar electricity \u2022 Wind-generated electricity \u2022 Electricity from microhydropower sources \u2022 Emerging technologies\u2014hydrogen, fuel cells, methane digesters, and biodieselThe Homeowner\u2019s Guide to Renewable Energy gives readers sufficient knowledge to hire and communicate effectively with contractors and, for those wanting do installations themselves, it recommends more detailed manuals. With a complete resource listing, this well-illustrated and accessible guide is a perfect companion for illuminating the coming dark age.Dan Chiras has studied renewable energy and energy efficiency for three decades and has installed several renewable energy systems. He lives in a self-designed passive solar/solar electric home. An award-winning author of over 20 books, he is a sustainability design consultant who teaches courses on renewable energy, green building, and sustainability at Colorado College.",

        "Description": "At the Home for the Dying in Calcutta, Mother Teresa often cared for the residents as they approached the end. As she was ministering to one illness-ravaged man, a visitor overheard her whisper a few words to him. \"You say a prayer in your religion, and I will say a prayer as I know it,\" she said. \"Together we will say this prayer and it will be something beautiful for God.\" These gentle words of solace and care provide us with a glimpse of a Mother Teresa often overlooked ? the universal teacher of prayer. With this deeply profound collection of her writings on prayer, Mother Teresa offers guidance and inspiration for people of all faiths seeking to walk a spiritual path. The first and only book devoted to Mother Teresa's teachings on prayer, it is interfaith in orientation and appeals equally to Catholics, Protestants, disenchanted Christians, people of non-Christian faith traditions, and unaffiliated spiritual seekers.",

Today we finally have the means and increasingly the conviction to end this scourge and to bring millions of slaves to freedom. Read Kevin Bales's practical and inspiring book, and you will discover how our world can be free at last.\"--Desmond Tutu\"Ever since the Emancipation Proclamation, Americans have congratulated themselves on ending slavery once and for all. But did we? Kevin Bales is a powerful and effective voice in pointing out the appalling degree to which servitude, forced labor and outright slavery still exist in today's world, even here. This book is a valuable primer on the persistence of these evils, their intricate links to poverty, corruption and globalization--and what we can do to combat them. He's a modern-day William Lloyd Garrison.\"--Adam Hochschild, author of Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves\"I know modern slavery from the inside, and since coming to freedom I am committed to end it forever. This book shows us how to make a world where no more childhoods will be stolen and sold as mine was.\"--Given Kachepa, former U.S. slave, recipient of the Yoshiyama Award\"Kevin Bales does not just pontificate from behind a desk. From the charcoal pits of Brazil to the brothels of Thailand, he has seen the victims of modern day slavery. In Ending Slavery, Bales gives us an update on what's happening (and not happening), and a controversial plan to abolish slavery in the 21st century. This is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about the great human rights issue of our times.\"--Ambassador John Miller, former director of the U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons",

        "Description": "Horace Rumpole isn't particularly fond of Christmas Day - he finds it has a horrible habit of dragging on as he and She Who Must Be Obeyed go through the usual rituals in Froxbury Mansions. After the exchange of presents (lavender water for her, a tie for him), they settle down to a supermarket turkey with all the trimmings, followed by a glass of port. The only excitement comes in deciding whether to stand for the national anthem after the Queen's speech.But at least the criminal fraternity rarely takes a holiday, so over the years Rumpole has found his festive celebrations disturbed in most welcome ways. Whether it's a Father Christmas who behaves suspiciously at Equity Court's Christmas party, or a high-profile murder trial that comes up at the Bailey just before the holiday season or a body discovered at the health spa where Rumpole is gloomily trying to survive a not-so-festive Christmas diet of yak's milk and spinach - there's always something wonderfully unlawful to liven up the dull holiday plans.When Sir John Mortimer died in January 2009, it was widely agreed that Horace Rumpole was his greatest fictional creation. In these delightful Christmas stories, never before published in book form, the great barrister lives on.",
