        "Title": "Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens our Future",
        "Authors": "By Mooney, Chris and Kirshenbaum, Sheril",
        "Description": "In his famous 1959 Rede lecture at Cambridge University, the scientifically-trained novelist C.P. Snow described science and the humanities as \"two cultures,\" separated by a \"gulf of mutual incomprehension.\" And the humanists had all the cultural power\u2014the low prestige of science, Snow argued, left Western leaders too little educated in scientific subjects that were increasingly central to world problems: the elementary physics behind nuclear weapons, for instance, or the basics of plant science needed to feed the world's growing population.Now, Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum, a journalist-scientist team, offer an updated \"two cultures\" polemic for America in the 21st century. Just as in Snow's time, some of our gravest challenges\u2014climate change, the energy crisis, national economic competitiveness\u2014and gravest threats--global pandemics, nuclear proliferation\u2014have fundamentally scientific underpinnings. Yet we still live in a culture that rarely takes science seriously or has it on the radar.For every five hours of cable news, less than a minute is devoted to science; 46 percent of Americans reject evolution and think the Earth is less than 10,000 years old; the number of newspapers with weekly science sections has shrunken by two-thirds over the past several decades. The public is polarized over climate change\u2014an issue where political party affiliation determines one's view of reality\u2014and in dangerous retreat from childhood vaccinations. Meanwhile, only 18 percent of Americans have even met a scientist to begin with; more than half can't name a living scientist role model.For this dismaying situation, Mooney and Kirshenbaum don't let anyone off the hook. They highlight the anti-intellectual tendencies of the American public (and particularly the politicians and journalists who are supposed to serve it), but also challenge the scientists themselves, who despite the best of intentions have often failed to communicate about their work effectively to a broad public\u2014and so have ceded their critical place in the public sphere to religious and commercial propagandists.A plea for enhanced scientific literacy, Unscientific America urges those who care about the place of science in our society to take unprecedented action. We must begin to train a small army of ambassadors who can translate science's message and make it relevant to the media, to politicians, and to the public in the broadest sense. An impassioned call to arms worthy of Snow's original manifesto, this book lays the groundwork for reintegrating science into the public discourse--before it's too late.",

Now he's determined to find the ring's owner and purpose.

A covert course designed to create ruthless assassins for C.I., it was shuttered by Congress for corruption. Yet before it was dismantled, it produced Bourne and Arkadin, giving them equal skills, equal force, and equal cunning. As Bourne's destiny circles closer to Arkadin's, it becomes clear that the eventual collision of these men is not of their own making. Someone else has been watching and manipulating them. Someone who wants to know, Who is the more deadly agent?",

        "Authors": "By Pinchbeck, Daniel",
        "Description": "In this unsparing tour of the perils and promises of the current era,   visionary author Daniel Pinchbeck helps us understand that we don't need to wait   for the dawning of the next age to radically change our perspectives.       In the years since his pioneering work 2012, Daniel Pinchbeck has touched   a legion of readers hungry for insight and guidance about new ways of living   amid the crises of the current moment.    Notes from the Edge Times collects Pinchbeck's most penetrating recent   columns, articles, and essays that amount to an extraordinary mosaic view of the   hopes, nightmares, and signs of breakthrough that mark our present era.   Pinchbeck examines the current economic collapse (an event he had foreseen by   many months), radical political and ecological alternatives, the uses of   psychedelics for spiritual insight, the revival of the sexual revolution,   unexplained phenomena such as crop circles and the Norway spiral, the imminent   (and often-misunderstood) question of 2012, and what it means to be an artist in   a time of radical change.    Pinchbeck's virtuosity as a social critic, on full display in these pieces, is   his ability to illuminate real and serious questions within unconventional   topics that most literary intellects are unwilling to touch, from secret weapons   systems to extrasensory abilities to the intelligence of plant life.   In Notes from the Edge Times, Pinchbeck does more than critique present-  day questions and conflicts; he provides fresh ideas for living more consciously   now, and for constructing our own more enlightened futures, even as the world   around us faces profound environmental, social, and spiritual challenges",

        "Description": "?No country, no culture, no person today is untouched by what happens in the rest of the world.\u00a0 Technological innovation, environmental degradation, economic gain & loss, nuclear weapons, instant communication have all created unprecedented familiarity among the world\u2019s many cultures. With this historic development, the Dalai Lama understands that the essential task of humanity in the 21st Century is to cultivate peaceful coexistence.\u00a0 \u00a0Many believe in the inevitability of an escalating \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d.\u00a0 Peaceful coexistence has long been problematic with religion, and while previous conflicts over religious differences may have been significant and regrettable, they did not threaten the very survival of humanity. Now, when extremists can persuade followers with the immense emotional power of faith and have access to powerful technological resources, a single spark could ignite a powder keg of frightening proportions. \u00a0Yet the Dalai Lama shows how the challenges of globalization can also move us in another direction, to a deeper plane where nations, cultures, and individuals connect through their shared human nature.\u00a0 All major religions confront the same perennial questions; each have distinct forms of expression. But this marvelous diversity of insight has the potential for inspiring dialogue which can enrich everyone\u2019s pursuit of wisdom.\u00a0 All faith traditions turn to compassion as a guiding principle for living a good life. It is the task of all people with an aspiration to spiritual perfection to affirm the fundamental value of the compassion. In this way we can truly develop a deep recognition of the value of other faiths, and on that basis, we can cultivate genuine respect.\u00a0In Toward a True Kinship of Faiths, the Dalai Lama also explores where differences between religions can be genuinely appreciated without serving as a source of conflict. The establishment of genuine harmony is not dependent upon accepting that all religions are fundamentally the same or that they lead to the same place.\u00a0 Many fear that recognizing the value of another faith is incompatible with having devotion to the truth of one\u2019s own.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the Dalai Lama profoundly shows how a sincere believer can, with integrity, be a pluralist in relation to other religions without compromising commitment to the essence of the doctrinal teachings of their own faith.\u00a0An issue of central importance for the Dalai Lama personally and for the entire world in general, Toward a True Kinship of Faiths offers a hopeful yet realistic look at how humanity must step into the future.",

        "Authors": "By Lobe, Kirsten",
        "Description": "Is it possible to maintain chic as a single-mom-to-be in a city where it's all supposed to be effortless and breastfeeding is a horreur?  Does one live by the Parisienne's pregnancy plan of smoking, drinking, and cheese-eating avec vin blanc, but jamais jamais gain more than six kilos? And how to handle a pickup attempt by a married man in the baby department of Bon March\u00e9 when you're eight months along?  After all, American girls do things differently: Lamaze class and baby showers, sensible prenatal care and\u2026family to watch you proudly grow more and more pregnant.Paris is full of delights for a new mom: the Luxembourg Gardens, baby boutiques too precious to be passed by, a petit brioche for a teething tot.  But home exerts a powerful pull. Should your child grow up skipping by the Seine or scampering up a tree house?  Should it be \"Mommy\" or \"Maman\"? And can a tall blonde with a taste for Veuve Cliquot and Vuitton ever make it in the land of mom jeans and Happy Meals?Paris, Baby! is novelist Kirsten Lobe's warm, funny memoir about Paris, Frenchmen, friendship, babies, and making it on one's own.",

        "Title": "Howard Dean's Prescription for Real Healthcare Reform: How We Can Achieve Affordable Medical Care for Every American and Make Our Jobs Safer",
        "Authors": "By Dean, Howard, Volsky, Igor, and Shakir, Faiz",
        "Description": "\"What would real healthcare reform look like? And how can everyday Americans trump big money and put healthcare back on track? Howard Dean speaks out.\"The success of healthcare reform legislation rises and falls on whether the American public is allowed to opt into a universally available public healthcare program, like Medicare, or not. If Congress issues a bill that gives Americans a public option, then there will be real healthcare reform. If not, we could be back fighting about it for another 20 years before anybody tries again.\"--Howard DeanAmericans have pondered how to reform healthcare since the days of Harry Truman. But, for most Americans, little has changed--except that healthcare costs have soared, health insurance companies have grown richer, and, today, even those Americans who pay dearly for health insurance frequently find that their policies don't adequately cover them when they need their coverage most.Something has got to give. In his bold, new book, Howard Dean-the physician and former governor widely credited for reviving the Democratic Party after the 2004 elections-tells Americans what needs to be done to successfully reform healthcare. One key, he writes, is to offer Americans the option to participate in a public healthcare program, much like Medicare. \"America has had 'socialized' medicine since 1964,\" says Dean. \"It's called Medicare; it covers every American over 65, and the majority of them are happy with the program. The rest of America deserves a similar option.\"In this straight-talking guide to rising above today's healthcare crisis, Dean spells out:What Obama's healthcare plan is all aboutHow other countries handle healthcareWhich special interests are standing in the way of progress and whyHow healthcare reform will help American businesses prosperWhy Americans need choice--between private or public health coverageMillions of Americans lack health insurance; millions more pay for coverage that doesn't protect them from serious illness; and the status quo leaves Americans at the mercy of corporate interests. In this persuasive argument from a passionate political strategist, Americans learn how to take back the healthcare reins.",

        "Title": "Essential Italian Grammar (Dover Language Guides Essential Grammar)",
        "Authors": "By Ragusa, O.",
        "Description": "In this very useful manual, Dr. Ragusa has presented all the Italian really needed in everyday life and contemporary situations, without devoting space to the intricacies of literary, archaic, and poetic forms that you are not likely to need.It is remarkable how readily Italian grammar lends itself to this form of essential grammar, for within this book Miss Ragusa has presented her material with such clarity that you will probably remember most of what you have read after a single reading. Among the unusual features of this presentation are an extremely clear statement of the complex pronoun situation, an easily followed analysis of the various verb tenses and moods, and a most useful discussion of the many verb idioms that are so important in Italian.All the major aspects of Italian grammar are presented in logical, developmental order: vocabulary, vocabulary building, word order, turning negative sentences into positive and vice versa, forming questions, nouns, articles, prepositions, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, verbal idioms, and whatever else is necessary to a knowledge of essential Italian. An appendix contains clear definitions of all the grammatical terms used in the book.Essential Italian Grammar is not a simplified grammar, not an abridged grammar, but a selected grammar for adult use, with emphasis upon explanation rather than rote memory, and with inclusion of much phrase material for examples. It can be used as a supplement to a course, as an introduction, or as a refresher for those who have already studied Italian.",
