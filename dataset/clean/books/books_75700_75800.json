On Erde, song is magic, and Anna's musical ability makes her an enormously powerful sorceress - potentially. Life on Erde is harsh compared to Ames, but at least it's not boring. On Erde, Anna is in charge of her life for the first time - and she's making the most of it. With her unique power, her common sense, and her Integrity, Anna saved the kingdom of Defalk from invasion and in six months became its regent.After years of war and drought Defalk is hardly able to defend itself, and Anna must turn her efforts to rebuilding the kingdom before another neighbor tries to conquer it. But she may have no time: Defalk's southern neighbor is already encroaching on the border. In the realpolitik atmosphere of Erde, Anna will have to teach a harsh lesson to demonstrate that she will not allow Defalk's greedy neighbors to nibble her country to death. And since the sexist rulers of most of the neighboring kingdoms are still convinced that women are weak, Anna may have to make the lesson she teaches doubly harsh.Rising to power in Defalk may have been the easy part; now Anna will need all her skill and intelligence merely to hold on to what she's managed to accomplish so far.",

        "Description": "The official companion book, edited by director Terry George, including essays on the history of the genocide, the complete screenplay written by Keir Pearson & Terry George, and more than 70 photographs. A Story That Had to Be Told: In 1994, as his country descended into madness, Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager of a Belgian-owned luxury hotel in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, used cunning and courage to save 1,268 people from certain death while the rest of the world closed its eyes. His real-life story inspired the Oscar-nominated writer of In the Name of the Father, Terry George, to make the extraordinary film, Hotel Rwanda, starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix, and Nick Nolte, which has received accolades from critics and moviegoers alike, winning numerous awards. Now, in the only official companion book, comes the fascinating filmmaking story, with first-person pieces by Terry George and co-screenwriter Keir Pearson about their three-year struggle to gain support and financing, as well as a brief history of Rwanda with details on the actual events portrayed in the movie. Illustrated with more than 70 historical and contemporary photos and movie stills, the book also includes journalist Nicola Graydon's report on joining Paul Rusesabagina when he first returned to Rwanda on the tenth anniversary of the genocide; writer Anne Thompson's personal journal of her visit to the set in Africa during production in February 2004; and a compelling transcript of the PBS Frontline documentary revealing the afterthoughts of officials who chose not to listen to the cries for help. In addition there is a timeline of the crisis, a further reading and viewing list, and the complete screenplay. \"Hotel Rwanda is the most powerful film of its kind since Schindler's List.... Like Oskar Schindler, Don Cheadle's Paul is a politically uninvolved man who becomes a very unlikely hero....This is an important story told with respect and care, and though the subject matter once again is very grave, very serious, this is also one of the most inspirational movies I've ever seen.\"Richard Roeper, Ebert & Roeper Report \"Courage, Winston Churchill once said, is the virtue that makes all other virtues possible. Hotel Rwanda reminds us of that with dramatic force and compelling poignancy.\"Richard Schickel, Time",

        "Title": "The Second Civil War: How Extreme Partisanship Has Paralyzed Washington and Polarized America",
        "Authors": "By Brownstein, Ronald",
        "Description": "From one of America's most respected political commentators, an epic, shrewd, and important big-picture analysis of the forces that have made this era in American politics as divisive and bitterly partisan as any since the Civil War.  Few don't appreciate that in recent years American politics has seemingly become much more partisan, more zero-sum, more vicious, more willing to make mountains out of molehills, and less able to confront the mountains of real problems we face. And yet in poll after poll, the percentage of Americans who identify themselves as either \"very conservative\" or \"very liberal\" hasn't budged in more than a generation. What has happened? In The Second Civil War, Ronald Brownstein brilliantly diagnoses the electoral, demographic, and institutional forces that have brought such change over the American political landscape, pulling politics to the margins and leaving precious little common ground for compromise.  Displaying the deep historical perspective for which he is noted, Brownstein begins with a history of the evolving climate for partisanship since the dawn of the modern political era in 1896, presenting a fresh and bold reinterpretation of American politics and the personalities who have shaped it from Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  Offering both sweeping analysis and intimate detail drawn from exclusive interviews with top officials and strategists in both parties, The Second Civil War captures the currents that have carried America to today's dangerous impasse, from little-understood changes in congressional rules that made it easier for parties to enforce discipline and discourage compromise to the rise of special-interest pressure groups to a vastly changed media environment that has become much more vicious and much less serious.  While there was no Golden Age, and in many respects the increasing plurality of voices that get to have a say in our politics is all to the good, the net-net is a system in which compromise and conciliation are thwarted at almost every turn and big problems that require broad consensus continue to fester ominously, unaddressed and growing more and more painful to face as we approach crisis situations. But Ronald Brownstein ends with a menu of clear and compelling ways out of our collective dilemma, largely centering on the opportunity for unifying leadership. The Second Civil War is not a book for Democrats or Republicans per se but for all Americans who are disturbed by our current political dysfunction and hungry for ways to understand it-and move beyond it.",

The operation was sanctioned by President Thomas Jefferson, who at the last moment grew wary of \"intermeddling\" in a foreign government and sent Eaton off without proper national support. Short on supplies, given very little money and only a few men, Eaton and his mission seemed doomed from the start. He triumphed against all odds, recruited a band of European mercenaries in Alexandria, and led them on a march across the Libyan Desert. Once in Tripoli, the ragtag army defeated the local troops and successfully captured Derne, laying the groundwork for the demise of the Barbary Pirates.

Vivi Ann, the youngest, is the undisputed star of the family. Everything comes easily to Vivi Ann, her father's love most of all.

        "Description": "The fall of Saddam Hussein's brutal regime brought the first glimpse of freedom for Iraq and unleashed elation, resentment, and chaos. On the one hand, there is hope: the Iraqi people have their first chance at independence. On the other hand, there is despair: the country is exploding with violent sectarian and political power struggles. Through it all, Iraq has remained an enigma to much of the world. What is it about this country that makes for such a seemingly intractable situation? How did Iraq's particular history lead to its present circumstances? And what can we fear or hope for in the coming years?Fouad Ajami, one of the world's foremost authorities on Middle Eastern politics, offers a brilliant, illuminating, and lyrical portrait of the ongoing struggle for Iraq and of the American encounter with that volatile Arab land. Ajami situates the current unrest within the context of Iraq's recent history of dictatorship and its rich, diverse cultural heritage. He applies his incisive political commentary, his broad and deep historical view, his mastery of the Arabic language and Arabic sources, and his lustrous prose to every aspect of his subject, wresting a coherent, fascinating, and textured picture from the media storm of fragmented information.In the few years after the Iraq war began, Ajami made many trips to that country and met Iraqis of all ethnicities, religions, politics, and regions. Looking beneath the familiar media images of Iraq and the war, Ajami visits with individuals representing the breadth of Iraq's populace, from Sunni leaders and Shia clerics to Kurdish politicians and poets, Iraqi policemen, and ordinary people voting for the first time in their lives. He also hears from American soldiers on the ground, and the result of all his encounters is an astonishing portrayal of a land that has emerged as a crucial battleground between American power and the wider forces of Arab religious and political extremism.With his unrivaled access -- he has been granted an audience with the great, reclusive Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and been admitted into the sacred shrine of Imam Ali in Najaf for a discussion with its religious scholars -- Ajami provides an intimate portrait that draws on both his learning and his lifelong interest in the traditions and the history of Iraq. With his commentator's eye, his scholarly depth of understanding, his poetic ear, and his abiding love for the Middle East, Fouad Ajami is an essential voice for our times. The Foreigner's Gift is the book we all need to read in order to understand what is happening in Iraq today and what the future might hold for all of us.",

So Holly returns to her hometown of Orchid Beach, Florida, where she had been police chief for many years. But a very unpleasant surprise awaits her. Many years earlier, Holly and another female army officer had brought charges against their commanding officer for sexual harassment, attempted rape, and rape. Holly had managed to fight him off, but the other woman, a young lieutenant, had not. The officer in question was acquitted of all charges, and has also left the army-for a job as Orchid Beach's new police chief. Will Holly return to the CIA? Or will she challenge her old nemesis for control of the Orchid Beach Police Department?",

        "Description": "To the uninitiated, the title may seem like an oxymoron: after all, aren't hacks what network security is supposed to prevent? But if you're network administrator, this book's title not only makes sense; it makes a lot of sense. You know that a busy administrator needs a hatful of devilishly effective security hacks to keep your 12-hour days from becoming all-nighters.Network Security Hacks is not a long-winded treatise on security theory.  Instead, this information packed little book provides 100 quick, practical, and clever things to do to help make your Linux, UNIX, or Windows networks more secure today.This compendium of security hacks doesn't just cover securing TCP/IP-based services, but also provides intelligent host-based security techniques. Loaded with concise but powerful examples of applied encryption, intrusion detection, logging, trending, and incident response, Network Security Hacks will demonstrate effective methods for defending your servers and networks from a variety of devious and subtle attacks.Network Security Hacks show how to detect the presence (and track every keystroke) of network intruders, methods for protecting your network and data using strong encryption, and even techniques for laying traps for would-be system crackers. Important security tools are presented, as well as clever methods for using them to reveal real, timely, useful information about what is happening on your network.O'Reilly's Hacks Series reclaims the term \"hacking\" for the good guys--innovators who use their ingenuity to solve interesting problems, explore and experiment, unearth shortcuts, and create useful tools.  Network Security Hacks lives up to reputation the Hacks series has earned by providing the \"roll-up-your sleeves and get-it-done\" hacks that most network security tomes don't offer. Every hack can be read in just a few minutes but will save hours of searching for the right answer.Using just one of these amazing hacks will make this slim book's price seem like a remarkable deal.  The other 99 make Network Security Hacks absolutely invaluable.",

When they need encouragement, she brims with fierce determination to help them succeed. Hers is the first face we see as we enter the world and the one that stays with us long after she is gone.This celebration of the many faces of motherhood makes the perfect holiday gift and, much as Chicken Soup for the Mother's Soul, is destined to become a classic.",

Advertising no longer works. Weaned on TiVo, the Internet, and other emerging technologies, the short-attention-span generation has become immune to marketing. Consumers are \u201cin control.\u201d Or so we\u2019re told.In Buying In, New York Times Magazine \u201cConsumed\u201d columnist Rob Walker argues that this accepted wisdom misses a much more important and lasting cultural shift. As technology has created avenues for advertising anywhere and everywhere, people are embracing brands more than ever before\u2013creating brands of their own and participating in marketing campaigns for their favorite brands in unprecedented ways. Increasingly, motivated consumers are pitching in to spread the gospel virally, whether by creating Internet video ads for Converse All Stars or becoming word-of-mouth \u201cagents\u201d touting products to friends and family on behalf of huge corporations. In the process, they\u2013we\u2013have begun to funnel cultural, political, and community activities through connections with brands. Walker explores this changing cultural landscape\u2013including a practice he calls \u201cmurketing,\u201d blending the terms murky and marketing\u2013by introducing us to the creative marketers, entrepreneurs, artists, and community organizers who have found a way to thrive within it. Using profiles of brands old and new, including Timberland, American Apparel, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Red Bull, iPod, and Livestrong, Walker demonstrates the ways in which buyers adopt products, not just as consumer choices, but as conscious expressions of their identities. Part marketing primer, part work of cultural anthropology, Buying In reveals why now, more than ever, we are what we buy\u2013and vice versa. Praise for Buying In\u201cWalker \u2026 makes a startling claim: Far from being immune to advertising, as many people think, American consumers are increasingly active participants in the marketing process. \u2026 [He] leads readers through a series of lucid case studies to demonstrate that, in many cases, consumers actively participate in infusing a brand with meaning. \u2026 Convincing.\u201d \u2014 Jay Dixit, The Washington Post \u201cWalker lays out his theory in well-written, entertaining detail.\u201d \u2014 Seth Stevenson, Slate \u201cBuying In delves into the attitudes of the global consumer in the age of plenty, and, well, we aren\u2019t too pretty. Walker carries the reader on a frenetically paced tour of senseless consumption spanning from Viking ranges to custom high-tops.\u201d \u2014 Robert Blinn, Core77 \u201cRob Walker is one smart shopper.\u201d \u2014 Jen Trolio, ReadyMade \u201cThe most trenchant psychoanalyst of our consumer selves is Rob Walker. This is a fresh and fascinating exploration of the places where material culture and identity intersect.\u201d \u2013Michael Pollan, author of In Defense of Food \u201cThis book has vast social implications, far beyond the fields of marketing and branding. It obliterates our old paradigm of companies (the bad guys) corrupting our children (the innocents) via commercials. In this new world, media-literate young people freely and willingly co-opt the brands, and most companies are clueless bystanders desperate to keep up. I really don't know if this is good news or bad news, but I can say, with certainty, that this book is a must-read.\u201d\u2013Po Bronson, author of What Should I Do with My Life? \u201cRob Walker is a gift. He shows that in our shattered, scattered world, powerful brands are existential, insinuating themselves into the human questions \u2018What am I about?\u2019 and \u2018How do I connect?\u2019 His insight that brand influence is becoming both more pervasive and more hidden\u2013that we are not so self-defined as we like to think\u2013should make us disturbed, and vigilant.\u201d\u2013Jim Collins, author of Good to Great\u201cRob Walker is a terrific writer\u00a0who understands both human nature and the business world. His book is highly entertaining, but it\u2019s also a deeply thoughtful look at the ways in which marketing meets the modern psyche.\u201d\u2013Bethany McLean, editor at large, Fortune, and co-author of The Smartest Guys in the Room\u201cAre we living in an era of YouTube-empowered, brand-rejecting consumers? Rob Walker has the surprising answers, and you won\u2019t want to miss this joyride through the front lines of consumer culture. A marketing must-read.\u201d\u2013Chip Heath and Dan Heath, authors of Made to Stick\u201cRob Walker brilliantly deconstructs the religion of consumption. Love his column, couldn\u2019t put his book down.\u201d\u2013Paco Underhill, author of Why We Buy",

        "Description": "Like Joseph Bernardin, people with illness or disability first need to resolve the ever-important 'Why?' question.

These holy men and women, each from a different background and time period, suffered illness or disability, and through prayer found acceptance, strength and hope.

As you journey through your own pain&#151;or walk a difficult path with a loved one&#151;you will want to look to these spiritual companions and their stories to find your own meaning in suffering.",
