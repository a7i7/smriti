Dozens of step-by-step illustrations of technique in Fish:The Basics ensure that the seafood cook, whether beginner or expert, will never be caught short and forced to choose something less than fresh.",

Russell Culver is fifteen in 1904, and he's raring to leave his tiny Indiana farm town for the endless sky of the Dakotas. To him, school has been nothing but a chain holding him back from his dreams. Maybe now that his teacher has passed on, they'll shut the school down entirely and leave him free to roam.No such luck. Russell has a particularly eventful season of schooling ahead of him, led by a teacher he never could have predicted-perhaps the only teacher equipped to control the likes of him: his sister Tansy. Despite stolen supplies, a privy fire, and more than any classroom's share of snakes, Tansy will manage to keep that school alive and maybe, just maybe, set her brother on a new, wiser course.",

Or perhaps\u2014as Carl Maria von Weber and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow agree \u2014\"the universal language of mankind\"? Whatever it is, it certainly \"hath charms to soothe the savage breast,\" as William Congreve famously observed. And it \"expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent\" (Victor Hugo).These and more than 400 other striking quotes about music, from musicians, authors, poets, historical figures, and other celebrities, fill the pages of this entertaining, practical little book. Not all are on the serious side; many are deliciously witty: \"Her singing was mutiny on the high C's\" (Hedda Hopper); \"I can hold a note as long as the Chase National Bank\" (Ethel Merman); \"Donny Osmond has van Gogh's ear for music\" (Orson Welles). The quotations are arranged alphabetically according to author, from Fred Allen (\"When Jack Benny plays the violin, it sounds as if the strings are still back in the cat\") to Florian Zabach (\"A musical talent is like having six fingers on one hand. You're born with it, you're different because of it, you can't do a thing about it except put it to use\"). They constitute a collection that will not only be an indispensable reference for public speakers but will also delight general readers\u2014especially music lovers\u2014with its enduring wisdom and humor.",

The book offers a panoramic snapshot of the gentleman: witty and poignant, traditional but spontaneous, flirtatious yet courting. Discussions range from the classic (Motoring, Oenophilia) and serious (Secrets & Lies, The Good Husband), to the racy (Kink & Fetish, To the Power of 3) and silly (Bumper Stickers, Fonzarelli Moves & Legerdemain ). And since it is inevitable that a gentleman will dabble in the friskier areas of excess, trouble, and chance, the book's naughty nucleus, ?\u00c4\u00faThe Potent Gentleman,?\u00c4\u00f9 explores leisure and dalliance, from alcohol and snuff to recreational botanicals and sex.All men aspire to be perpetually dapper, fluent in three languages, and hit 300-yard drives off the blue tees, not to mention quote poetry by the stanza and win a back-alley scrap. However, there is a dashing plateau more desirable than Hollywood perfection, a level of gallantry that makes one stand out, even in the elevator. So knot up your ascot, pour a glass of sherry, and crack open the MODERN GENTLEMAN: your Man Cycle is peaking.",

Kathleen, the imperious editor in chief, is smarting from a betrayal in her open marriage; Arthur, the lazy obituary writer, is transformed by a personal tragedy; Abby, the embattled financial officer, discovers that her job cuts and her love life are intertwined in a most unexpected way. Out in the field, a veteran Paris freelancer goes to desperate lengths for his next byline, while the new Cairo stringer is mercilessly manipulated by an outrageous war correspondent with an outsize ego. And in the shadows is the isolated young publisher who pays more attention to his prized basset hound, Schopenhauer, than to the fate of his family\u2019s quirky newspaper.As the era of print news gives way to the Internet age and this imperfect crew stumbles toward an uncertain future, the paper\u2019s rich\u00a0history is revealed, including the surprising truth about its founder\u2019s intentions.Spirited, moving, and highly original, The Imperfectionists will establish Tom Rachman as one of our most perceptive, assured literary talents.",

        "Description": "Attempting to repair the fissures of everyday life, Brian Brodeur negotiates the psychological distances between desire and disgust, humor and catastrophe, banality and dream. The poems of Other Latitudes begin in the realm of personal experience, and expand into larger territories of cultural narcissism and political blindness. These poems meditate on the tenuous relationship between artist and subject, the curiosities of self-inflicted wounds, and the presence of hope in a landscape that is intrinsically scarred. Brodeur\u2019s debut illustrates the conflict between inner lives and their outward appearances, with an eye turned to the unforgiving natural world.",
