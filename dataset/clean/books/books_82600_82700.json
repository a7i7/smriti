        "Description": "\"For far too long, conservatives were the only voices heard on talk radio. But no longer. Now there's a whole community of strong and dynamic progressive voices on the airwaves. As Bill Press shows, progressive radio is alive, well, and growing!\"---Congressman James E. Clyburn, House Majority Whip\"Good for Bill Press! Finally somebody exposes that gang of right-wing talk-show hosts for the hate-mongers they are. If you want to know how much damage Rush Limbaugh and his clones have done to free speech, read this book!\"---E D Schultz, host of The Ed Schultz Show\"I Poke fun at the `right-wing world' on my own radio show every day. But Bill Press shows us that the world of right-wing talk is not only stupid, it's dangerous. I dare Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity to read this book. If they ever did, they would immediately resign in shame!\"---Stephanie Miller, host of The Stephanie Miller Show\"Finally, a bare-knuckled challenge to those bullies on talk radio who invent their own truths. Bill Press is a progressive breath of fresh air.\"---Senator Byron Dorgan, New York Times bestselling author\"For too long, talk radio was the exclusive playhouse of right-wing extremists. No longer. Now we see them exposed for what Bill Press rightly calls them, toxic talkers. We also see the promise, from a progressive perspective, of more and more strong truth-tellers.\"---U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders\"Impassioned, entertaining, and sure to please...thoughtfully reminds readers how and why religion and government need to be protected from each other in order to flourish.\"---Publishers Weekly\"This thoughtful look at religion and politics in America will interest even those who may not agree with its premises.\"---BooklistThe American Airwaves have become a toxic arena. With 91 percent of weekday talk radio programs dedicated to conservative opinions---including in liberal cities such as New York, Boston, and San Francisco---the right-wing has done an end run around the principles of democratic representation. Rush Limbaugh is now the unofficial leader of the Republican Party, and the most vocal leaders of the radical right-wing revolution have reached new heights---or sunk to new depths---in polluting political radio and television and ruining any chance for constructive public debate.The time is long overdue to take a hard look at the hard-right domination of talk radio. Syndicated talk-show host Bill Press takes off the gloves and goes after the biggest offenders. Speaking as a voice crying out in the radio wilderness, he takes on the bully pulpit of \"Rushbo\" Limbaugh and reveals Sean Hannity's series of distortions; the savageness of Michael Savage; Bill O'Reilly and his nothing but spin zone; Lou Dobbs's curious legitimizing of the \"birther\" movement; Mark Levin's personal attacks against Sonia Sotomayor and Nancy Pelosi; Laura Ingraham's \"death camp\" rhetoric; Jay Severin's diatribes against Mexico; and much, much more.Perhaps more important, Press exposes the reason such a disproportionate roster of fear-mongering conservatives is on the air. The Big Five radio syndicates that control the industry, such as Clear Channel and Citadel, have transformed democratic media into a plutocratic propaganda machine. With this timely canon blast at the radical right, Press delivers an entertaining and incisive condemnation of the blustering and hypocritical pundits who have poisoned the airwaves for too long.",

        "Title": "John Gielgud: The Authorized Biography",
        "Authors": "By Morley, Sheridan",
        "Description": "Sir John Gielgud's career as an actor was perhaps the most distinguished of any of his generation, and, in a lifetime that spanned almost a century, he appeared in hundreds of theatrical productions and films, receiving virtually every honor given, including an Academy Award.  Now, in this wonderfully insightful biography, fully authorized and written with first-ever access to Gielgud's personal letters and diaries, bestselling biographer Sheridan Morley not only traces the actor's fascinating career, but provides a fresh and remarkably frank look into John Gielgud the man, showing how his success as an actor in many ways came at the expense of his personal happiness.  Born into a theatrical family, John Gielgud took to the stage as naturally as a duck to water, and almost from the beginning, those who saw him perform knew that they were experiencing something extraordinary. A determined actor, intent on learning and polishing his craft, he worked incessantly, taking on one role after another, the greater the challenge, the better.  During his long and remarkable career, he took on every truly great and demanding role, including all of Shakespeare's major plays as well as many contemporary and experimental productions. At ease in both great drama and light comedy, he was blessed with a great range and a seemingly infinite capacity to inhabit whatever character he attempted.  Basically a somewhat shy man offstage, however, Gielgud for the most part limited his friendships to those with whom he worked, and as a result the theater -- and later, film -- made up just about his entire life. That he was flesh and blood, however, was reflected in the fact that he did enter into two long-term relationships, the first with a man who eventually left him for another, but with whom Gielgud maintained a strong tie, and the second with a handsome, mysterious Hungarian who lived with him until he died, just a few months before Sir John.  True scandal came into Gielgud's life only once. In 1953, just weeks after Gielgud had been knighted by the Queen, he was arrested in a public men's room and charged with solicitation. The British press had a field day, but Gielgud's friends and fellow actors rallied to his support, as did his thousands of fans, and the result was the eventual change of law in England regarding sex between consenting adults.  While these and many other aspects of his personal life are discussed for the first time in this distinguished biography, it is Gielgud's career as an actor, of course, that receives the greatest attention. And while British audiences had the pleasure of seeing him perform in the theater for his entire life, Americans came to know him best for his work in the movies, and most especially for his Oscar-winning performance as Hobson the butler in the Dudley Moore film Arthur.  As dramatic and captivating as one of Sir John's many performances, this authorized biography is an intimate and fully rounded portrait of an unforgettable actor and a remarkable man.",

        "Title": "Elvis Is Titanic: Classroom Tales from the Other Iraq",
        "Authors": "By Klaus, Ian",
        "Description": "In the spring of 2005, Ian Klaus, a twenty-six-year-old Rhodes Scholar, traveled eight hours from Turkey, via broken-down taxi and armed convoy, to reach Salahaddin University in Arbil, the largest city in Iraqi Kurdistan. Elvis Is Titanic is the poignant, funny, and eye-opening story of the semester he spent there teaching U.S. history and English in the thick of the war for hearts and minds.Inspired by the volunteerism of so many young Americans after 9/11, Klaus exchanges the abstraction of duty for an intimate involvement with individual lives, among them Mahir, a rakish Kurdish pop star whose father, an imam, disapproves of music; Ali, an Anglomaniac professor of translation devoted to the BBC, with whom Klaus has a public showdown over Hemingway; and Sarhang, Klaus\u2019s bodyguard, whose interest in American history is excited by Mel Gibson\u2019s performance in The Patriot. Among the Kurds, a perennially oppressed but seemingly indomitable people, Klaus encounters both openhearted welcome and resentful suspicion\u2014and soon learns firsthand how far even a trusted stranger can venture in this society. With assignments ranging from Elvis to Ellington, from the mysteries of baseball to the aper\u00e7us of Tocqueville, Klaus strives to illuminate the American way for charges initially far more attuned to our pop culture than our national ideals. These efforts occasion Klaus\u2019s own reexamination of truths we hold to be self-evident, as well as the less exalted cultural assumptions we have presumed to export to the rest of the world. His story, as full of hope and discovery as he finds his students, offers a slice of life behind the headlines.",

Then Delores Enriquez's son Jose wanted to throw my Amanda aquinceanera--a coming-out party, Mexican style--and they're only fifteen!At least Bandana Woman, who held up our Yada Yada Prayer Group at knife-point last fall, was safely locked up in prison . . . or so I thought. We visited her, like the Bible says; even sent her something for Christmas. But then she ends up back in our face. I mean, how far is forgiveness supposed to go?I guess I should have realized that with eleven Yada Yada sisters as diverse as a bag of Jelly Bellies, life would always be unpredictable. All I know is that the longer we Yada Yada pray together, the more \"real\" things are getting, not only with each other but with God. Dull and boring? Not a chance.",

But one sunny afternoon, as visitors are crowding the viewing platforms, a woman collapses and dies on this great Paris landmark. Can a bee sting really be the cause of death? Or is there a more sinister explanation? Enter young bookseller Victor Legris. Present on the tower at the time of the incident, and appalled by the media coverage of the occurrence, he is determined to find out what actually happened. In this dazzling evocation of late nineteenth-century Paris, we follow Victor as his investigation takes him all over the city and he suspects an ever-changing list of possible perpetrators. Could mysterious Kenji Mori, his surrogate father and business partner at the bookstore Legris operates, be involved in the crime? Why are beautiful Russian illustrator Tasha and her colleagues at the newly launched sensationalist newspaper Passepartout always up-to-date in their reporting? And what will Legris do when the deaths begin to multiply and he is caught in a race against time? Murder on the Eiffel Tower is painstakingly researched, an effortless evocation of the glorious City of Light, and an exciting opening to a promising series of eight books featuring Victor Legris.",

These powerful essays are grouped into four categories: Significance, Relationships, Aspirations, and Courage. In each essay the authors consider a thorny and often ambiguous issue with which today\u2019s leaders must grapple issues\u2014such as how leaders serve and sacrifice, why leaders need loving critics, why leaders should want to be liked, why leaders can't take trust for granted, why it\u2019s not just the leader\u2019s vision, why failure is always an option, why it takes courage to \u201cmake a life,\u201d how to liberate the leader in everyone, and ultimately, how the legacy you leave is the life you lead.",

        "Title": "Guide to Companion Parrot Behavior",
        "Authors": "By Athan, Mattie Sue",
        "Description": "A companion parrot is to a bird lover what a favorite lapdog is to its owner -- a friend through thick and thin. This book offers a wealth of advice on such topics as choosing between a young parrot and an older bird, selecting and training a talking parrot, modifying some of a companion parrot's behavior traits and periodically reinforcing behavior changes, keeping the bird groomed and away from household safety hazards, and virtually all other aspects of care. The author, a respected parrot expert, discusses ways of coping with occasional problems that include excessive screaming and feather chewing, and describes general differences in behavior among various companion birds - budgies, lovebirds, cockatiels, macaws, conures, lories and others.",

        "Authors": "By Pollack, Kenneth M.",
        "Description": "In his highly influential book The Threatening Storm, bestselling author Kenneth Pollack both informed and defined the national debate about Iraq. Now, in The Persian Puzzle, published to coincide with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Iran hostage crisis, he examines the behind-the-scenes story of the tumultuous relationship between Iran and the United States, and weighs options for the future.Here Pollack, a former CIA analyst and National Security Council official, brings his keen analysis and insider perspective to the long and ongoing clash between the United States and Iran, beginning with the fall of the shah and the seizure of the American embassy in Tehran in 1979. Pollack examines all the major events in U.S.-Iran relations\u2013including the hostage crisis, the U.S. tilt toward Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, the Iran-Contra scandal, American-Iranian military tensions in 1987 and 1988, the covert Iranian war against U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf that culminated in the 1996 Khobar Towers terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia, and recent U.S.-Iran skirmishes over Afghanistan and Iraq. He explains the strategies and motives from American and Iranian perspectives and tells how each crisis colored the thinking of both countries\u2019 leadership as they shaped and reshaped their policies over time. Pollack also describes efforts by moderates of various stripes to try to find some way past animosities to create a new dynamic in Iranian-American relations, only to find that when one side was ready for such a step, the other side fell short.With balanced tone and insight, Pollack explains how the United States and Iran reached this impasse; why this relationship is critical to regional, global, and U.S. interests; and what basic political choices are available as we deal with this important but deeply troubled country.",

My story begins not with my birth but a murder, committed the year before I was born\u2026\"Florence, April 1478: The handsome Giuliano de' Medici is brutally assassinated in Florence's magnificent Duomo. The shock of the murder ripples throughout the great city, from the most renowned artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, to a wealthy wool merchant and his extraordinarily beautiful daughter, Madonna Lisa.More than a decade later, Florence falls under the dark spell of the preacher Savonarola, a fanatic who burns paintings and books as easily as he sends men to their deaths.  Lisa, now grown into an alluring woman, captures the heart of Giuliano's nephew and namesake.  But when Guiliano, her love, meets a tragic end, Lisa must gather all her courage and cunning to untangle a sinister web of illicit love, treachery, and dangerous secrets that threatens her life.Set against the drama of 15th Century Florence, I, Mona Lisa is painted in many layers of fact and fiction, with each intricately drawn twist told through the captivating voice of Mona Lisa herself.",

In it Smith analyzes the major elements of political economy, from market pricing and the division of labor to monetary, tax, trade, and other government policies that affect economic behavior. Throughout he offers seminal arguments for free trade, free markets, and limited government.Criticizing mercantilists who sought to use the state to increase their nations\u2019 supply of precious metals, Smith points out that a nation\u2019s wealth should be measured by the well-being of its people. Prosperity in turn requires voluntary exchange of goods in a peaceful, well-ordered market. How to establish and maintain such markets? For Smith the answer lay in man\u2019s social instincts, which government may encourage by upholding social standards of decency, honesty, and virtue, but which government undermines when it unduly interferes with the intrinsically private functions of production and exchange.",

In You've Come a Long Way, Maybe, she debunks the cultural and political myths surrounding women, and looks at the wide range of reactions Hillary, Michelle and Sarah provoked from the small towns to the big city salons to the Sunday talk shows. She pays special attention to those most active and most examined during the election: the disappointed Hillary supporters, the rabid Sarah Palin fans, and everyone else wondering about the role of the new First Lady. Along the way, Leslie takes a hard look at what the election will mean for women now and in the future, and also at what leaders might emerge in 2012, and beyond.",
