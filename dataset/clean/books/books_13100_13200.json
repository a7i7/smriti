Jeremiah claims to be anointed by God to wield vengeance against the \"evils\" that plague America. His targets are carefully chosen to undermine the nation's legal system, political structure, and economy, as well as to create religious, racial, and ethnic strife. Jeremiah even makes skillful use of the Internet to preach and proselytize.Television is the main medium for his message, however, and the unwitting messenger is Laura Delaney, the beautiful anchor of a top-rated news-magazine show. Jeremiah gives Laura advance notice of his attacks, and calls in his rationale during the show. Off the air, he stalks her obsessively and irrationally, wanting her love and endorsement.Spearheading the government effort to capture Jeremiah is FBI agent Steve Wallace, who must also protect Laura Delaney. Together Steve and Laura risk their careers and lives to foil Jeremiah's master plan.",

        "Title": "Anyone Can Grow Up: How George Bush and I Made It to the White House",
        "Authors": "By Carlson, Margaret",
        "Description": "Margaret Carlson -- widely read Time columnist, regular CNN panelist, political insider, and hostess of A-list but scarcely traditional Washington dinners -- has been commenting on American life for over a decade. In Anyone Can Grow Up, she expands on her writings about presidents, politics, morals, children, family life, and lessons from her own life.  In the section entitled \"Presidential Material,\" Carlson reflects on what it takes to be president by looking at those who choose to pursue the office (and by extension, those, like her, who choose to cover the pursuit). She looks at the hard facts (offices held, speeches given, money raised) and the soft, sometimes determinative, ones (how the candidates talk and look, how they perform under pressure, who they marry and divorce when no one is looking, and how they get into -- and out of  -- scrapes). The best man doesn't always win. That's why those who've lost, and those who almost run but don't, are covered as well. Bush Sr. and son, and Clinton in his scandalous term, are here. Carlson also takes a look at those whom have thought of running, like Donald Trump, those who America wanted to run, like Colin Powell, and those who've run and lost, like John McCain.  Carlson draws from her own life in the \"Family Matters\" section as well, commenting on subjects relating to children, women, and men -- from abortion to balancing work and family, from feminism to sexual harassment.  Finally, in the last section, we read about what makes us who we are and what makes us do what we do. From breaking down how congressmen make money on the side to what cost Newt Gingrich his job, from days in court trying the Menendez brothers to a memorable three-hour lunch with Katharine Hepburn that didn't turn out the way she imagined, Carlson finds the strength of character, or lack of it, in Americans famous and not.  Carlson gets as many as a hundred letters a week from readers who say, \"That's exactly what I was thinking.\" In the vein of Anna Quindlen, Ellen Goodman, and Bill O'Reilly, here is a wise and witty book from a writer who knows what makes us tick.",

        "Description": "\"So what? All the other kids get to do it!\"  Few behavioral problems challenge and frustrate parents, caregivers, and teachers as does verbal rudeness in children of any age. Reinforced by the wise-cracking kids on TV and in the movies, backtalk has become all too common among today's youngsters. But there is nothing cute about this behavior. Remarks like \"Yeah, right,\" \"Big deal,\" and \"Make me\" -- form children as young as three -- get in the way of real communication between parents and kids, and can also be detrimental to a child's social and intellectual development.  Now two experts in the field share their simple and specific four-step program for ending backtalk and restoring balance in relationships between parents and children, from preschoolers to teens. You'll learn how to recognize backtalk, how to choose and enact a response that will make sense to you and the backtalker, and when to disengage from the struggle and move forward. Full of advice and encouragement as well as suggestions on how to keep track of what works and what doesn't, Backtalk can be put to use immediately, before you hear another \"Whatever.\"",

After the Tiananmen Square massacre strands her in Australia with no money or prospects, Syn becomes entangled in a steamy and consuming affair with a married butcher named Zhu.Though ever sensible of the soothsayer's predictions, Syn, in the grip of passion, is full of hope for the future.

        "Description": "Many journalists have mastered the Washington political scene, while others have gained entree to the highest echelons of Israeli politics.  Wolf Blitzer is one of the few to have done both.  An American fluent in Hebrew, Blitzer has interviewed and gained the respect of nearly all the major policy-makers in Israel and the United States over the past dozen years.  The late Anwar Sadat credited Blitzer with first giving him the idea of making his historic trip to Jerusalem.     The U.S.-Israeli relationship is like no other and this book helps explain why.  Most importantly, it outlines the limits of the relationship, explaining why neither country can afford an all-out confrontation.  There is special emphasis on the way decisions are made in Washington--the role of the foreign policy bureaucracy, Congress, the press, the Jewish community, the Arabs and their supporters, and the official Israeli presence.  In addition, chapters cover the special U.S.-Israeli cooperation in military, strategic, and intelligence matters.     The book is filled with fascinating vignettes of people: the career diplomat responsible for the explosive (in 1975 terms) Saunders document which said, \"In many ways, the Palestinian dimension of the Arab-Israeli conflict is the heart of that conflict.\"...the American industrialist who became involved in some spectacular diplomatic back-channel efforts to save Soviet Jews...the German-Jewish refugee secretary of state who came to play such a decisive role in American-Israeli affairs...the three deeply religious leaders, Begin, Sadat, and Carter, \"who progressed from an agreement to pray together to an agreement to make peace once and for all.\"     From his unique vantage point, Blitzer considers the potential for either sharp strains or even closer collaboration in the future.",

Every rule of this secretive process receives close scrutiny, as does the rich history behind the conclave and the key issues that will shape the future of the Catholic Church at a time when it is in crisis, in the U.S. and abroad. You'll discover why the election always concludes with the rising of white smoke; what powers the Cardinals hold during the vacancy of the holy See; and what startling changes Pope John Paul II made to the centuries-old procedures. Look back at some of the more than 200 holy men and scoundrels, geniuses and mediocrities who have held the lofty position of Pope, and then look forward to possible successors to Pope John Paul II. In addition, there's a day-by-day account of the balloting inside the Sistine Chapel.Whether your interest is historical, religious, or political, you'll enjoy a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the Vatican.",

        "Description": "If anything ever happens to me, promise me that you will see that there is an investigation....And find Ann Rule and ask her to write my story,\" Sheila Blackthorne Bellush told her sister after she divorced multimillionaire Allen Blackthorne. Now, in perhaps the first book ever written at a victim's request, America's Number One bestselling true-crime writer, Ann Rule, untangles a horrific web of lies that culminated in Sheila's savage murder more than ten years after she left Blackthorne. When beautiful, blond Sheila married the charming, handsome Blackthorne, she was convinced she had found her perfect soul mate, and helped him reach his goal of living the privileged life of the country club set. But behind Allen's smooth facade, she discovered a violent, controlling sociopath -- a liar, a scam artist, a sexual deviant. When she finally fled with their two young daughters, she was skeletally thin, bruised, and beaten. Although Sheila recovered, remarried, and was starting a new life and family, she still felt she was doomed. Joyously pregnant, she and her new husband expecting quadruplets, Sheila still feared Blackthorne, who had sworn to her he would monitor her every move and \"every breath you take.\" And, in fact, Blackthorne inevitably tracked her down, as did her killer, who left her in a pool of blood marked by the tiny footprints of her two-year-old toddlers. The questions remained: Could the authorities ever link Sheila's murder to Blackthorne himself? Was his true obsession high-stakes golf and his extravagant pink mansion -- or was it to destroy Sheila? Following a trail of deception from Oregon and Hawaii to Texas and Florida, Ann Rule gained complete access to Sheila's family, friends, and neighbors, as well as to the detectives and prosecutors on the case. With Every Breath You Take, Ann Rule has written a heart-pounding account of obsession, revenge, and murder that will enthrall readers from beginning to end.",

        "Description": "With feng shui, the ancient Chinese art of placement, you can change your life by rearranging your home. The careful arrangement of the contents of any room, from kitchen to office, can dramatically improve your health, finances, and relationships.Creating good feng shui can be as simple as moving your furniture, and as subtle as hanging a mirror or highlighting an auspicious color. Feng shui can be as personal as your own decorating taste: Once you set your goals and priorities - whether to improve family harmony or succeed in business - you can put feng shui to work especially for you.This easy-to-use room-by-room handbook provides tips for good feng shui in every part of your home, as well as simple cures for feng shui problems: If you have an interior staircase that directly faces your front door, good luck may be running directly out the door - and out of your life. A mirror on the landing of the stairs can draw in positive energy and circulate it around your home for better luck. For more restful sleep and better health, move your bed away from overhanging beams. A beam that cuts across a bed can create aches and pains in the parts of the body exposed to it - virtually \"cutting in half\" the life of the sleeper - and a beam that divides the bed between the sleepers can result in marital problems. Keep stove burners clean - clogged burners can block your income potential - and use all the burners regularly. The heat and energy passing through these openings will keep your family's business prospects from growing cold. Move your desk so it faces your office door, not the wall. If your back is to the door, you'll be surprised by people coming in - as well as by what they have to say. Enhance your finances by placing a fish tank in your living room or office. The flow of water represents cash flow, and the fish symbolize abundant wealth - there are always more fish in the sea!",

Featuring fossils of dinosaurs as well as mammals, amphibians, and other ancient creatures, these breathtaking new halls showcase more than eight hundred spectacular prehistoric fossil specimens and share the latest in scientific thinking regarding ancient life. Complete with interactive computer programs and new models that take full advantage of modern technology to depict dinosaurs and other ancient animals as they would have looked millions of years ago, the exhibition halls also display the Museum's best-known and most widely recognized fossil specimens, paying homage to the talent and devotion of the fossil hunters from the Museum's Department of Vertebrate Paleontology who have collected, assembled, and analyzed this world-renowned collection.Now, with The American Museum of Natural History's Book of Dinosaurs and Other Ancient Creatures, dinosaur lovers of all ages can take both an exciting behind-the-scenes look at the explorers who unearthed these intriguing fossils as well as an in-depth armchair tour of the animals on display in the Museum's fossil halls. This beautiful, full-color illustrated volume brings the world-famous Museum, its collectors, and its collection vividly to life.Brimming with offbeat tidbits and anecdotes about the fossil hunters and their discoveries, this insider's companion to the Museum includes profiles of such men as Henry Fairfield Osborn, the first curator of the Department of Vertebrate Paleontology at the Museum; Barnum Brown, the Museum's premier fossil hunter for more than sixty years and the first to discover a specimen of the magnificent carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex; Charles Sternberg, who devoted his outwardly successful but personally troubled life to collecting dinosaur and other fossils; and Roy Chapman Andrews, who is said to be the real-life model for the movie character Indiana Jones and who made the world-famous discovery of the first dinosaur eggs.This volume also details the fascinating work that the Museum's modern-day scientists conduct both in New York City at the Museum and in the field. New discoveries about life on the planet during the dinosaurs' reign are being made regularly, and many of these new theories are discussed here. In fact, the illustrations presented throughout this volume reflect the latest in scientific thinking, showing animals in reconfigured postures, which adds greater insight into their eating and hunting habits as well as their evolutionary lineages.This fact-filled guidebook then moves on to profile the animals themselves.

In an era of cultural civil war, the Clinton administration fed the public an almost daily diet of scandal and misfortune.Who is Bill Clinton, though, and how did this baby-boom saga begin? Clinton's upbringing in Arkansas and his student years at Georgetown, Oxford, and Yale universities help us to see his life not only as a personal story but as the story of modern America.",

        "Description": "We've all sung it a thousand times, and most of us know at least the first verse by heart. \"America the Beautiful\" has been called a hymn, a prayer, even the \"national heartbeat set to music.\" Numerous proposals and half a dozen bills in Congress have tried to replace our national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" with this more lyrical, less militaristic song. But who knows the story behind the song?   In America the Beautiful, Lynn Sherr tells the story of Katharine Lee Bates, a poet and pioneering young English professor at the newly established Wellesley College, who penned \"America the Beautiful\" at age 33, as she gazed over the glorious panorama from the top of Pike's Peak, Colorado. The poem, published two years later on July 4, 1895, struck a chord. Americans embraced it and immediately set it to music, trying out at least 74 different melodies. There were even Mexican, Canadian, and Australian versions. Analyzing the lyrics of \"America the Beautiful\" and the story of Katharine Lee Bates's unusual life, Lynn Sherr opens a window onto the shifting world of late 19th century America. She explores the lingering impact of the Civil War and the dramatic developments in commerce and technology, which shaped the American Century and the popularity of one brilliant, stirring song.",

        "Description": "In July 1993, White House official Vincent Foster wrote an anguished lament: \"in Washington...ruining people is considered a sport.\"Nine days later, Foster was dead. Shock at the apparent suicide of one of President Clinton's top aides turned to mystery, then suspicion, as the White House became engulfed in an ever-widening net of unanswered questions. Among the confidential matters Foster was working on when he died was the Clintons' ill-fated investment in Whitewater, an Arkansas land development. Soon conspiracy theories were circulating, alleging that Foster was murdered because he knew too much. And the Whitewater affair, a minor footnote to the 1992 presidential campaign, was suddenly resurrected in the national media. To a degree that left them stunned and at times depressed, the president and first lady have been buffeted by a succession of scandals, from the first lady's profitable commodities trading to the sexual harassment allegations of Paula Jones. Like its predecessors, the Clinton presidency soon found itself engulfed in allegations of scandal, conspiracy, and cover-up.Drawing on hundreds of interviews, many with people speaking publicly for the first time, James B. Stewart sheds startling new light on these and other mysteries of the Clinton White House. In a fast paced narrative that ranges from a backwater town in the Ozarks to the Oval Office, from newsrooms in New York and Los Angeles to offices of conservative think tanks and special prosecutors, the result is an unprecedented portrait of political combat as it is waged in America today.Going beyond the news headlines, Blood Sport also tells the fascinating stories of key figures at the heart of the action, such as Jim McDougal, once Clinton's political and financial mentor, and his glamorous but naive wife, Susan, who swept the Clintons into their real estate empire, then faced financial ruin. It is the story of top national reporters and editors such as Jeff Gerth of The New York Times, who broke the Whitewater story only to find himself the object of controversy. It is the story of David Bossie, the tireless conservative operative who became a one-man army against the Clintons and even penetrated a network news operation. It is the story of Paula Jones, a small-town girl with dreams of Hollywood, and of the Arkansas state troopers who broke their code of silence to add fuel to the Clinton scandals. It is the story of prosecutors Kenneth Starr and Robert Fiske, the secretive, powerful independent counsels whose wide-ranging investigations could vindicate - or destroy - a president.",

        "Authors": "By Chambers, Marcia",
        "Description": "A woman in Indiana had belonged to the local country club since she was a child. Her parents were members. She gets married and brings her husband into the club. Eventually, she and her husband divorce. He remains a member and she is thrown out....Traditionally and historically, men owned the shares in the clubs - they created the rules that restricted access to their non-working wives. In the past, women accepted such restraints. But today, a young, determined generation of women who grew up believing in equality insist that golf is a key to business success, and refuse to accept the indignities of the past.For five years, seasoned journalist and legal expert Marcia Chambers interviewed these women, following them from living room to courtroom, from clubhouse to statehouse, from fairway to picket line. Now, in the first book to expose the rampant discrimination that pervades the game, Marcia Chambers presents a lively, authoritative look at why traditional activism doesn't work, and offers winning strategies to help women break through these barriers and create positive change. From the informal, conciliatory approaches that have been successful in some clubs to the hardball tactics that become necessary when rules won't bend, The Unplayable Lie offers women a wide range of options and alternatives.From public and resort courses to some of the nation's most exclusive private - even all-male - clubs, Marcia Chambers draws on other true stories of women, and some men, who have challenged their clubs' policies, sometimes successfully, sometimes with disastrous results. She shows how their tenacity ultimately helped change the clubs' agendas, with positive and permanent results.The Unplayable Lie shows women how to claim their rightful status as equal partners enjoying the many benefits of golf - professional, social, and recreational - that have long been enjoyed exclusively by men.",

        "Title": "The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives",
        "Authors": "By Lerner, Harriet Goldhor",
        "Description": "In this fresh, challenging new book, Dr. Lerner invites us to join her in a groundbreaking exploration of the many faces of truth and deception in women's lives. Through examples that are both startlingly intimate and deeply political, Dr. Lerner provides us with bold insights into the countless ways (and whys) that women show the false and hide the real.Deception is not a \"woman's problem,\" or even a uniquely human phenomenon: From viruses to large mammals, deception is continuously at play. We are all affected by lying and faking, by silence and pretending, by self-deception, and by brave - as well as misguided - efforts to tell the truth. Dr. Lerner shows us that women's failure to live authentically and speak truly deserves our closest attention. She illustrates how pretending is so closely linked with femininity that it is, quite simply, what the culture teaches us to do.Truth-telling is the central challenge in women's lives, the foundation of intimacy, self-regard, and joy. At the center of a woman's life is the quest to discover, speak and live her own truth, to cease living a life dictated and defined by others. Yet in the name of \"truth\" or \"being ourselves,\" we may hurt others by disregarding their different realities and move situations from bad to worse.How can we approach the process of truth-telling, of knowing and being known, of refining and deepening our disclosures to one another? Like peace-making, truthtelling does not just \"happen.\" Sometimes it must be worked toward and planned.Drawing on more than two decades of clinical experience, Dr. Lerner articulates her rich philosophy and thoughtful guidelines about speaking out and holding back. She shows us how honesty can sometimes impede truth-telling and how pretending can be a bold move toward the truth, rather than a misdirected flight from it. She examines how patriarchy shapes what truths a woman can uncover, share, and invent about herself. And she teaches us how to widen the path to truth-telling for everyone.The Dance of Deception is Harriet Lerner's most timely, provocative, and passionate work to date. From sexual faking to family secrets, readers will be rewarded with important insights into how we engage in deception and approach truth-telling - a subject that is at the heart of who we are in the world and what kind of world this is.",

        "Title": "Kindly Lights: A History of the Lighthouses of Southern New England",
        "Authors": "By Gleason, Sarah C.",
        "Description": "The lighthouse on a lonely point of land has become a romantic symbol of a bygone era when ships plied the seas without the aid of modern technology. In this concise history of the development of the lighthouse system in New England, Sarah Gleason brings to life this fascinating navigational era.Kindly Lights chronicles the history of the lights from the early days of the colonies, when lighthouses were built shoddily and haphazardly, usually soon after an all-too-predictable shipwreck, to the mid-nineteenth century when a national lighthouse system was established. In one compelling chapter, the author uncovers the story of David Melville, who conducted a remarkable experiment in gas lighting at Rhode Island's Beavertail lighthouse in 1817/18. It was to be a short-lived trial; Melville's innovations were resisted by Nantucket whalers fearful of losing their lucrative lighthouse oil market and by federal inspector Winslow Lewis, who plays a part in Melville's failure, as he did in so much of the history of the new nation's attempts to build a rational and technically sound lighthouse system.Kindly Lights includes an illustrated catalog of lights listing all inactive and active lights of southern New England, making it a practical as well as an armchair guide for the lighthouse devotee.In the last chapter we learn of the keepers themselves and of their families: of Newport's Ida Lewis, who became a national heroine for her oarsmanship and bravery and who, when asked how she kept her watch every night, replied, \"The light is my child, and I know when it needs me, even if I sleep.\" Through voices such as these Willett Clark's, Myrtle Corbishly's, George Nemetz's, and many others'--stories of unthinkable isolation, hardship, and dedication unfold.",

The story of this journey, which took her to a border kibbutz in Israel, becomes a mysterious tale of erotic awakening.Crossing the Border is a powerful story of sex, seduction, and intrigue. Love at the border is a dangerous affair, and in Crossing the Border love in a war zone becomes violent. The wild and tempestuous Kim Chernin set out on an adventure in 1971; the woman who came back was altered forever.Rich, multilayered, and as suspenseful as fiction, Crossing the Border is a tale of passion lived to its extreme. As lyrical as the writing of Marguerite Duras and as daring as the work of Jeanette Winterson, Crossing the Border is certain to provoke and captivate.",

Persistent, honest, resourceful, creative -- these adjectives begin to define the qualities of a great business leader. Along with the 26 other virtues enumerated in Wisdom, Inc., they are the fundamentals behind a business strategy that works, but they often get lost beneath passing fads and the color of one&#39;s parachute. Seth Godin&#39;s simple, highly readable handbook of business virtues will help everyone from assistant managers to CEOs cultivate habits that lead to a lifetime of good business. Godin interviewed 1,500 top executives from a wide range of industries to isolate the 30 virtues consistently named by respondents. Each virtue is addressed with inspirational stories of historical business leaders who distinguished themselves by exhibiting that virtue, as well as modern-day accounts by the executives interviewed demonstrating how the virtue has contributed to their companies&#39; successes. Most important, each virtue is accompanied by a section entitled \"To Do Today,\" which provides concrete suggestions for immediately incorporating the virtue into a daily routine. Both practical and inspirational, Wisdom, Inc. is a perfect gift or anyone in business.",

But this is the first time Fat Ollie Weeks of the 88th Precinct has written a novel, ah yes. Called Report to the Commissioner, it follows a cunning detective named Olivia Wesley Watts, who, apart from being female and slim, is rather like Fat Ollie himself. While Ollie's responding to the squeal about the dead councilman, his leather dispatch case is stolen from the back of his car -- and in it, the only copy of his precious manuscript.  Joined by Carella and Kling from the neighboring 87th Precinct, Ollie investigates the homicide with all the exquisite crudeness, insensitivity, and determination for which he is famous. But the theft of his first novel fills Ollie with a renewed passion for old-fashioned detective work.  Following the exploits of one of Ed McBain's most beloved detectives, this lively and complicated novel -- the fifty-second in the award-winning 87th Precinct series -- is perhaps his best book yet.",

From the homemade rockets and experiments of his childhood to the complex equations he solved as a professor of physics, his vision has transformed the uncertainty and frailty of life into an order and beauty that he inhabits with deep satisfaction. But his vision betrays him, revealing a profound incompleteness, an inadequacy to confront the contradictions of his life: the black maid who raises him and loves him but cannot welcome him into her own house, the mentally absent father who wishes he'd died a hero in World War II, the self-destructive wife who invites Bennett's cruelty. As Bennett struggles between reason and intuition, he slowly learns to allow the imperfections of daily life - the chaos he has worked so hard to control - to broaden his understanding of the world and his place in it.Written with lyrical sparseness, hilarity mixed with sadness, the story of Bennett's struggle becomes both a beautifully rendered portrait of the emotional life of a scientist and a resonant tale of the disillusionment that haunts us all.",
