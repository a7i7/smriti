        "Authors": "By Henslin, James M. (EDT)",
        "Description": "For more than twenty years, and through ten editions, James Henslin's Down to Earth Sociology has opened new windows onto the social realities that shape our world. Now in its eleventh edition, the most popular anthology in all of sociology includes new articles on our changing world while also retaining its classic, must-read essays. Focusing on social interaction in everyday life, the forty-five selections bring students face-to-face with the twin projects of contemporary sociology: understanding the individual's experience of society and analyzing social structure.  The eleventh edition's exceptional new readings include selections on social inequality and class relations in the United States, the development of racial awareness and identity, the subtleties of gender differences, the implicit rules people use to make their decisions, and the structural features of society that make drug dealing a regular part of inner-city life. Together with these essential new articles, the selections by Peter Berger, Kai Erikson, Herbert Gans, Erving Goffman, Arlie Hochschild, Jonathan Kozol, Zella Luria, C. Wright Mills, George Ritzer, Deborah Tannen, Barrie Thorne, Philip Zimbardo, and many others provide firsthand reporting that gives the student a sense of \"being there.\" Henslin also explains basic methods of social research, providing insight into how sociologists explore the social world. The selections in Down to Earth Sociology highlight the most significant themes of contemporary sociology, ranging from the sociology of gender, power, politics, sports, and religion, to the contemporary crises of racial tension, violent crime, rape, poverty, and homelessness.",

        "Description": "Spanning the centuries from Sappho's Greece to tenth-century Japan, from nineteenth-century Chile to Zindziswa Mandela's twentieth-century South Africa, the voices of these women poets express themes of love, injustice, motherhood, and loss, and the oppressions of race and sex.  The sequence of the poems moves from youth to old age, and they bear witness to the triumphs as well as the pain and frustration of women in many times and in many places.  Among the many poets whose work is included are Anna Akhmatova, Maya Angelou, Judith Kazantzis, Gabriela Mistral, Marge Piercy, Irina Ratushinskaya and Alice Walker.Illona Linthwaite began gathering this collection several years ago, initially for a theatrical performance.  Here, in this unique exchange between women of many races, affirming their differences and what they have in common, are more than 150 poems which assert the black abolitionist Sojourner Truth's challenge, \"Ain't I a Woman!\"In addition to the poems, there are biographies of the 91 contributors.",

        "Authors": "By Menand, Louis",
        "Description": "The Metaphysical Club is the winner of the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for History.A riveting, original book about the creation of modern American thought.The Metaphysical Club was an informal group that met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872, to talk about ideas. Its members included Oliver Well Holmes, Jr., future associate justice of the United States Supreme Court; William James, the father of modern American psychology; and Charles Sanders Peirce, logician, scientist, and the founder of semiotics. The Club was probably in existence for about nine months. No records were kept. The one thing we know that came out of it was an idea -- an idea about ideas. This book is the story of that idea.Holmes, James, and Peirce all believed that ideas are not things \"out there\" waiting to be discovered but are tools people invent -- like knives and forks and microchips -- to make their way in the world. They thought that ideas are produced not by individuals, but by groups of individuals -- that ideas are social. They do not develop according to some inner logic of their own but are entirely depent -- like germs -- on their human carriers and environment. And they thought that the survival of any idea deps not on its immutability but on its adaptability.The Metaphysical Club is written in the spirit of this idea about ideas. It is not a history of philosophy but an absorbing narrative about personalities and social history, a story about America. It begins with the Civil War and s in 1919 with Justice Holmes's dissenting opinion in the case of U.S. v. Abrams-the basis for the constitutional law of free speech. The first four sections of the book focus on Holmes, James, Peirce, and their intellectual heir, John Dewey. The last section discusses some of the fundamental twentieth-century ideas they are associated with. This is a book about a way of thinking that changed American life.\"",

        "Title": "Wealth and Democracy: How Great Fortunes and Government Created America's Aristocracy",
        "Authors": "By Phillips, Kevin P.",
        "Description": "For more than thirty years, Kevin Phillips' insight into American politics and economics has helped to make history as well as record it.  His bestselling books, including The Emerging Republican Majority (1969) and The Politics of Rich and Poor (1990), have influenced presidential campaigns and changed the way America sees itself. Widely acknowledging Phillips as one of the nation's most perceptive thinkers, reviewers have called him a latter-day Nostradamus and our \"modern Thomas Paine.\"  Now, in the first major book of its kind since the 1930s, he turns his attention to the United States' history of great wealth and power, a sweeping cavalcade from the American Revolution to what he calls \"the Second Gilded Age\" at the turn of the twenty-first century.The Second Gilded Age has been staggering enough in its concentration of wealth to dwarf the original Gilded Age a hundred years earlier. However, the tech crash and then the horrible events of September 11, 2001, pointed out that great riches are as vulnerable as they have ever been.  In Wealth and Democracy, Kevin Phillips charts the ongoing American saga of great wealth\u2013how it has been accumulated, its shifting sources, and its ups and downs over more than two centuries.  He explores how the rich and politically powerful have frequently worked together to create or perpetuate privilege, often at the expense of the national interest and usually at the expense of the middle and lower classes.With intriguing chapters on history and bold analysis of present-day America, Phillips illuminates the dangerous politics that go with excessive concentration of wealth.  Profiling wealthy Americans\u2013from Astor to Carnegie and Rockefeller to contemporary wealth holders\u2013Phillips provides fascinating details about the peculiarly American ways of becoming and staying a multimillionaire.   He exposes the subtle corruption spawned by a money culture and financial power, evident in economic philosophy, tax favoritism, and selective bailouts in the name of free enterprise, economic stimulus, and national security.Finally, Wealth and Democracy turns to the history of Britain and other leading world economic powers to examine the symptoms that signaled their declines\u2013speculative finance, mounting international debt, record wealth, income polarization, and disgruntled politics\u2013signs that we recognize in America at the start of the twenty-first century.  In a time of national crisis, Phillips worries that the growing parallels suggest the tide may already be turning for us all.",

With it he has been able to effect a dramatic shift to the right in many vital areas of constitutional law. Displaying a judicial activism not seen since the 1930s, Rehnquist and his allies, in a series of 5-4 decisions, have undermined civil rights and weakened the federal government's ability to respond to pressing social needs.  As the Rehnquist court concludes its fifteenth term, the well-known constitutional authority Herman Schwartz has assembled seventeen distinguished legal scholars to evaluate its record on the many controversial issues that have come before it. Among them are Stephen Bright on capital punishment, Charles Ogletree on criminal procedure, Norman Redlich on religion, Allan Morrison and David Vladeck on regulation, and John Mackenzie on Bush v. Gore. The book concludes with an overall reflection on Rehnquist's legacy by Tom Wicker.",

What do politicians on either side need to do today to get our country back on track? Ben Barnes has the answers. Barnes had a front-row seat through it all. His political savvy and bravado made him a standout in the rough-and-tumble world of Texas politics. He won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1960, at the unheard-of age of 22, and four years later he became the youngest Speaker of the House since the Civil War. In 1968, he helped Congressman George Herbert Walker Bush get his son into the National Guard\u2014a controversy that would rage during the 2004 presidential election. In 1970, Lyndon Johnson told the public that Ben was destined to be the next US president to hail from Texas. Barnes\u2019s rollicking memoir recalls the glory days of his Texas past and blazes a trail for our country\u2019s future.",

From showing parents how to allow children to talk about their feelings to giving them concrete ways to contribute to national healing efforts, this profoundly wise book will help families everywhere move towards the common goal of a more stable and secure future.",

        "Description": "It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century. It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind\u2014the so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.",

A one-stop computer/e-mail policy writing kit, it examines the potentially astronomical costs of e-mail and Internet misuse, and gives you step-by-step guidelines for creating up-to-date, legally sound policies that explicitly define the rights and obligations of employees. e-policy is packed with background information, detailed instructions, sample clauses, prewritten policies you can put to immediate use, and real-life horror stories that emphasize how explosive these problems really can be - and how crucial the solution it provides is.",

It was the pain from that, from feeling ugly, that I always viewed as the great tragedy of my life. The fact that I had cancer seemed minor in comparison.\"At age nine, Lucy Grealy was diagnosed with a potentially terminal cancer. When she returned to school with a third of her jaw removed, she faced the cruel taunts of classmates. In this strikingly candid memoir, Grealy tells her story of great suffering and remarkable strength without sentimentality and with considerable wit. Vividly portraying the pain of peer rejection and the guilty pleasures of wanting to be special, Grealy captures with unique insight what it is like as a child and young adult to be torn between two warring impulses: to feel that more than anything else we want to be loved for who we are, while wishing desperately and secretly to be perfect.",

        "Authors": "By MediaMatters. Org and Brock, David (INT)",
        "Description": "Misstating the State of the Union reveals a simple truth that the media too often obscures: By every objective measure, the Clinton presidency was far better for America than the Bush presidency. Yet an army of conservative pundits have conspired to lie to the public about both the Clinton and Bush records, denying the proven success of progressive policies and leadership while shamelessly covering up abject conservative failures. This book dissects the conservative misinformation campaign to distort and discredit the progressive agenda point by point, while unmasking the dark ideological agenda and rank dishonesty behind all the cable TV and radio hot air.From Rush Limbaugh\u2019s claim that the federal government spends three times as much on education as defense (the truth: the government spends five times as much on defense as on education) to Sean Hannity\u2019s dismissal of air quality concerns to Ann Coulter\u2019s attacks on the elderly, this book clearly and concisely refutes many of the most dangerous right-wing lies in circulation in this political year, using sound logic, incontrovertible fact and illustrative charts and graphs.Misstating the State of the Union is the first book produced by Media Matters Action Network, the advocacy organization associated with Media Matters for America, a new nonprofit web-based media research center in Washington, DC, that monitors, analyzes and corrects conservative misinformation in the US media.David Brock, a writer in Washington, DC, is the author of The New York Times bestsellers Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative and The Republican Noise Machine: Right-Wing Media and How It Corrupts Democracy. He has written for Esquire, New York and the op-ed pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post.
