        "Title": "The Irony Of Virtue: Ethics And American Power",
        "Authors": "By Lefever, Ernest W.",
        "Description": "This definitive anthology is the fruit of one of America\u2019s most respected neoconservatives. Trained in Christian ethics, Ernest Lefever has been an articulate public policy advocate. Both conservatives and liberals will ignore his views at their peril.In this first-ever anthology of his most important work, Lefever takes a bold and lively march through the second half of the twentieth century. As an acute participant-observer who cares deeply about peace, freedom, and human dignity, Lefever became a neoconservative twenty years before Irving Kristol coined the term. For this volume, Lefever selected forty of his most influential essays from some 500 published pieces. They reveal his dramatic transformation from a liberal pacifist during World War II to a humane realist.The earliest essays, from Lefever\u2019s Yale Divinity School days, recount his experience as a civil rights activist during World War II and as a relief worker in the POW camps of postwar Europe. Later essays assess such institutions as the United Nations and the World Council of Churches. Lefever tackles a myriad policy issues from nuclear testing and human rights to arms control and the collapse of communism. His essays on the Berlin Wall and his reappraisal of the Vietnam legacy confirm his skill at combining history, political theory, and opinion journalism. An introductory autobiographical sketch vividly portrays Lefever\u2019s spiritual and political pilgrimage.",

        "Title": "In Our Own Best Interest: How Defending Human Rights Benefits Us All",
        "Authors": "By Schulz, William F. and Robinson, Mary (FRW)",
        "Description": "From the director of Amnesty International, a provocative new argument for defending human rights The Philippines, Haiti, Rwanda, Bosnia, east Los Angeles. The nightly news brings vivid images of the mistreatment of people all over the world into our living rooms. In the secure comfort of those rooms, we may feel sympathetic, but far removed from these atrocities. \"What does all this have to do with a person in east Tennessee?\" is the question, from a call-in radio program listener, that prompted Bill Schulz to write this book. Schulz provides answers with an insightful work, generously laced with compelling stories of women and men from all continents, which clearly delineates the connection between Americans' prosperity and human rights violations all over the globe. The book reveals the high cost to the U.S. military of acute political instability in Eastern Europe, the economic impact on U.S. businesses of systemic corruption in East Asia, the serious worldwide environmental hazards of nuclear fuel leaks in Russia, the imminent threat of deadly viruses spreading from Africa, and even the expensive consequences of substandard prison conditions in the United States, to name some examples. At the heart of each of these problems lies the abuse of basic human rights. Through these stories, Schulz builds a powerful case for defending our own interests by vigorously defending the human rights of people everywhere.\"If any foreign policy primer could be called a page-turner, it is this one by the executive director of Amnesty International USA. What the human rights community needs to do, argues Schulz in this well-written clarion call, is find 'the compelling reasons why respect for human rights is in the best interests of the United States.' . . . Schulz has written a clear and provocative book that should be read by all concerned with human rights and U.S. foreign policy and will draw new supporters among the general public.\" \u2014Publishers Weekly, Starred Review \"In such a climate, William F. Schulz, a former UUA president and current executive director of Amnesty International USA, has written a smart, detailed and compelling book about the urgency of the human rights movement. In Our Own Best Interest: How Defending Human Rights Benefits All Americans strikes at the core of existing notions of national self-interest by making the case that if we value our own lives and futures, we will pay serious attention to upholding human rights everywhere on earth. . . . In writing In Our Own Best Interests, Schulz has given new life and strength to the reality of our interdependence.\" \u2014World",

        "Title": "No Neutral Ground?: Abortion Politics In An Age Of Absolutes (Dilemmas in American Politics)",
        "Authors": "By O'Connor, Karen",
        "Description": "In a single year, Dr. David Gunn was killed, Jane Roe recanted, the Supreme Court began to backpedal from its landmark 1973 decision, Congress became fixated on a rare late-term abortion procedure, and numerous states imposed legislation limiting a woman\u2019s right to choose. It was a year of extremes for an issue that seems to know no middle ground, and it is the polarizing quality of abortion as a policymaking dilemma that No Neutral Ground? seeks to address.One of the most heated and often violent issues of our time, abortion continues to challenge leaders, citizens, and policymakers alike. Is it a question of morality? Personal liberty? The right to privacy? Keeping the peace? What are the implications of the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings on abortion for future legislation? And what does it mean for every level of government when an issue defies consensus the way that abortion does?In her unique treatment of this complex subject, Karen O\u2019Connor builds on the history of abortion as a political issue\u2014how it was first defined in the early 1800s and how it got on the political agenda\u2014and takes us through the tug-of-war development of abortion politics to the present, using the policy process framework. Examining key court cases, institutions, dramatic events, and opinions from the public to the Supreme Court, O\u2019Connor highlights the dilemma of how a polity attempts to make decisions about issues on which agreement or compromise is unlikely. She questions whether such divisive issues can ever be satisfactorily resolved, but gives us the tools to explore every avenue toward potential resolution.",

        "Description": "In 1925 Earl May began broadcasting KMA Radio-960 from Shenandoah,  Iowa, to boost his fledgling seed business. The station aired practical  information designed to help with the day-to-day activity in midwestern  farmhouse kitchens.

        "Description": "Hollywood, Walter Winchell quipped, is where they shoot too many movies and not enough actors. Always looking for an angle, always, scheming, always the scene of clashing egos, the movie industry is where they place you under contract instead of observation--and if you don't have anything nice to say, write it down. \"In 1940, I had my choice between Hitler and Hollywood,\" French director Ren\u00e9 Clair recalled, \"and I preferred Hollywood--just a little.\"In Movie Anecdotes, Peter Hay treats us to a delightful ride through the world that has captivated audiences for almost a century, with stories that are often hilarious, sometimes tragic, and always entertaining. He takes us from the rough-and tumble early days (when one studio paid Pancho Villa $25,000 to launch his attacks only in daylight, after a film crew had set up) to the studio era (when Joan Crawford refused to cross the street on the MGM lot except in a chauffeured limousine) to the shenanigans of today's global industry. Here are stories about all the legends: Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Mae West, Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Judy Garland, Sophia Loren, John Wayne, and, of course, Ronald Reagan. There are the great directors from D.W. Griffith, Hitchcock, and Eisenstein, to Kurosawa, Bergman, Visconti, Huston, Ford, and Woody Allen. And Hay has selected tales of the writers, the wits, and the grand moguls, including perhaps the largest collection of Goldwynisms--both genuine and apocryphal.Along with the laughter, this volume recreates the conflicts that have torn the movie world, from battles over money and contracts, to discrimination, divorces, and scandals. Colorful, incredible, bitter, funny--the stories about moviemaking are as fantastic as the pictures themselves. Now they have been gathered together in an irresistible bouquet that is certain to delight every movie buff and provide fascinating insights for serious students of film.",

The Chicago Tribune applauds her \"taut storytelling...tight plotting and lively characterization.\" The Miami Herald hails her for her \"well-paced, compelling stories and believable characters with emotional depth and texture that should turn casual readers into fanatics.\" And the San Antonio Express-News calls her novels simply \"enthralling.\" Now this supremely gifted author returns with a blockbuster story of smoldering suspense that pits Gail and Anthony against their most chilling adversary yet.  For attorneys Gail Connor and Anthony Quintana, spending a couple of days in a private villa on a secluded island in the Florida Keys seems almost too good to be true. The innocent clich\u00e9 hits home with a vengeance when a dangerously unbalanced former client of Anthony's is suspected of a local murder, and then attempts suicide. As an idyllic vacation turns into an escalating nightmare of terror and death, Gail and Anthony find themselves isolated among the strange and secretive islanders as a late tropical storm threatens to unleash its fury on them all. Somehow, they must hang on to their sanity and use every weapon at their disposal to outwit a wily criminal bent on plunging them into a world of deepening madness.  Filled with steamy atmosphere, stunning reversals, and hairpin twists and turns, and certain to be another sensational bestseller, Suspicion of Madness is Barbara Parker-one of America's best thriller authors writing today-at the top of her game.",

After a wrenching period of adjustment, he comes to feel rejuvenated by his involvement with the nation's first pro baseball players. He also finds his senses quickening and tastes changing as he faces life-threatening 19th-century challenges on and off the baseball diamond. Through his attachments to the ballplayers and the lovely Caitlin O'Neill, he might just regain the sense of family he desperately needs. Darryl Brock masterfully evokes post-Civil War America\u2019s smoky, turbulent cities, the new transcontinental railroad that takes passengers over prairies and mountains to California, the dance halls and parlor houses, the financial booms and busts, and historical luminaries like Mark Twain and Jesse James. Equally appealing to sports fans and anyone who likes a good read, If I Never Get Back well deserves the Cleveland Plain Dealer\u2019s judgment that it \u201chits a home run.\u201d",

        "Description": "As X moves out of the hacker's domain and into the \"real world,\" users can't be expected to master all the ins and outs of setting up and administering their own X software. That will increasingly become the domain of system administrators. Even for experienced system administrators, X raises many issues, both because of subtle changes in the standard UNIX way of doing things and because X blurs the boundaries between different platforms. Under X, users can run applications across the network on systems with different resources (including fonts, colors, and screen size). Many of these issues are poorly understood, and the technology for dealing with them is in rapid flux.This book is the first and only book devoted to the issues of system administration for X and X-based networks, written not just for UNIX system administrators but for anyone faced with the job of administering X (including those running X on stand-alone workstations). The book includes:An overview of X that focuses on issues that affect the system administrator's job.Information on obtaining, compiling, and installing the X software, including a discussion of the trade-offs between vendor-supplied and the free MIT versions of X.How to set up xdm, the X display manager, which takes the place of the login program under X and can be used to create a customized turnkey X session for each user.How to set up user accounts under X (includes a comparison of the familiar shell setup files and programs to the new mechanisms provided by X).Issues involved in making X more secure. X's security features are not strong, but an understanding of what features are available can be very important, since X makes it possible for users to intrude on each other in new and sometimes unexpected ways.How fonts are used by X, including a description of the font server.A discussion of the issues raised by running X on heterogenous networks.How colors are managed under X and how to get the same colors across multiple devices with different hardware characteristics.The administration issues involved in setting up and managing an X terminal.How to use PC and Mac X servers to maximize reuse of existing hardware and convert outdated hardware into X terminals.How to obtain and install additional public domain software and patches for X.Covers features new in R5, including the font server and Xcms.",

        "Title": "Messages from an Owl (Princeton Legacy Library, 326)",
        "Authors": "By Terman, Max R.",
        "Description": "When zoologist Max Terman came to the rescue of a great horned owlet in a Kansas town park, he embarked on an adventure that would test his scientific ingenuity and lead to unprecedented observations of an owl's hidden life in the wild. In Messages from an Owl, Terman not only relates his experiences nursing the starving owlet, \"Stripey,\" back to health and teaching it survival skills in his barn, but also describes the anxiety and elation of letting a companion loose into an uncertain world. Once Terman felt that Stripey knew how to dive after prey, he set the owl free. At this point his story could have ended, with no clue as to what the young bird's fate would be--had it not been for Terman's experimentation with radio tags. By strapping the tags to Stripey, he actually managed to follow the owl into the wild and observe for himself the behavior of a hand-reared individual reunited with its natural environment.Through this unique use of telemetry, Terman tracked Stripey for over six years after the bird left the scientist's barn and took up residence in the surrounding countryside on the Kansas prairie. The radio beacon provided Terman with information on the owl's regular patterns of playing, hunting, exploring, and protecting. It enabled him to witness the moments when Stripey was bantered and mobbed by crows, when other owls launched fierce attacks, and when a prospective mate caught Stripey's eye. On occasional returns to the barn, the owl would follow Terman around as he performed chores, usually waiting for a handout.Until now, scientists have generally believed that an owl nurtured by humans becomes ill-adapted for meeting the challenges of life in the wild. Terman's research proves otherwise. Stripey surpassed all expectations by becoming a totally independent wild creature. With Terman, however, Stripey remained tame, allowing the author to explore something one rarely sees in owls: a warm interest in humanity. Terman engagingly re-creates this dimension of Stripey as he describes with humor and compassion the daily challenges of probing the life of a \"phantom winged tiger.\"Originally published in 1996.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions.

Are you ready? Because God is still moving\u2014and asking you to do the same!  Inside Left Flap  Dare to Go There.  True Stories  When The Prayer of Jabez sold nine million copies in two years, Bruce Wilkinson\u2019s mailbox was flooded with countless personal stories of answered prayer. God\u2019s mighty hand was using the prayer to change lives in both small and dramatic ways. Such undeniable testimonies make it impossible to ignore God\u2019s presence, active and alive today!  Refreshing Clarity  Beyond Jabez examines the larger biblical context of the once little-known prayer found in 1 Chronicles 4:9\u201310. Wilkinson\u2019s sound instruction answers the skepticism surrounding the Jabez phenomenon and returns an awesome sense of wonder to the miracle of prayer.  Deeper Application  Packed with practical guidance from a man who daily prays Jabez\u2019s prayer\u2014and has for more than thirty years!\u2014 Beyond Jabez reveals how, with a sincere heart and a devoted prayer life, God can use you mightily for His purposes!  Story Behind the BookBruce Wilkinson spent thirty years studying and praying the prayer of Jabez. The original manuscript was over three hundred pages long. When The Prayer of Jabez was released in the spring of 2000, it had been culled down to 96 pages. It was originally intended as a gift from Bruce to the attendees of the 2000 National Day of Prayer. Now in 2005, the fifth anniversary of the release of the original Prayer of Jabez, the release of Beyond Jabez will be more like the book Bruce Wilkinson originally intended to write\u2014a book with more teaching, stories of God\u2019s blessings, and more application of what God intended of us in petitioning Him.",

Some had the foresight to design their gardens to look beautiful when viewed through the windows. Others bring their gardening pleasures inside, turning windowsills, spare bedrooms, and enclosed porches into makeshift greenhouses. Some happily don snowshoes to prune, chop, and saw their way through the winter, and some turn their creative gardening juices into making things for and from their gardens in kitchens and basement workshops. Whether the reader loves winter or stoically endures it, The Unsung Season will share both the pleasures and the survival techniques of these special gardeners.

        "Authors": "By McGraw, Jay",
        "Description": "Parents: Does your teen withdraw to his or her room at every opportunity? Does she talk with you about her friends? Does he participate in discussions at meals? Does your teen want you to see projects from school? When is the last time you actually went into your teen's room and looked at what's hanging on the walls and sitting on the shelves?  Teens: Do your parents hide behind the newspaper? Do they always have to work when you've got a game, a recital, or an open house at school? Is there anything you do together anymore? When was the last time they took a walk, a bike ride, or even a trip to get ice cream with you?  When did that sudden gap divide your home into territories staked and claimed, with music blasting through the halls and fists banging on doors to turn down the stereo/TV/video game? Teens, when did you start seeing your parents as your enemies instead of your heroes? And parents, when did you start seeing your teens as crazy little demons instead of your loving children?  Finally, there is a solution for both sides, and one that will not only bridge that gap but show parents and teens alike how to prevent it. Jay McGraw is the ideal person to write a book for both parents and teens. A bestselling author by the age of twenty-one and son of number one New York Times bestseller Phillip C. McGraw, Ph.D., known to millions worldwide as Dr. Phil, Jay has seen the parent-teen battle from all angles. In this groundbreaking work, he introduces a new plan for both teens and their parents to work through the issues that divide them and, in the process, rediscover the love that initially defined their relationship.  Jay works from both sides -- sharing the perspectives of parent and teen as the former struggles for control, the latter for independence. He explains to parents how their teenagers wish to be treated, cared for, and even disciplined, and he shows teens how gaining power can come only from earning respect. In this entertaining, informative, and life-changing book, Jay gives instructions to both sides of the familial gap on:  Dos and Don'ts for Parents and Teens Parent and Teen Myths Discovering Your Needs Tuning In to the Needs of Others Ten Ways to Bridge the Gap and Reconnect   In finding a common ground and, even more important, a common respect for each other, parents and teens can break down the walls, unlock the doors, and welcome each other back into one another's lives again.",

        "Description": "\"Carl Anthony takes you inside the world's most famous goldfish bowl for a glimpse at life in the White House as you've never seen it before.\"  -- Julie N. Eisenhower  The Kennedy White House is the first truly intimate look at Kennedy family life inside the White House. It is an unprecedented visit behind the scenes, revealing the world's most famous family in the world's most famous house. Author Carl Sferrazza Anthony scoured the Kennedy Library archives for never-before-seen color and black-and-white photographs that succeed in illustrating the Kennedy family story -- the joys and tragedies, celebrations and anniversaries, informal family gatherings and escapes to their private homes in Virginia, Palm Beach, Newport, and Hyannis Port. The book also explores for the first time the relationships between Jack and Jackie's nuclear family and both of their extended families.  The 337 full-color and black-and-white photos, taken by the primary White House photographers, are unstaged and provide a far more natural, spontaneous, and realistic portrait of the family than ever before; most of them, including color photographs of each of the private rooms, have never been seen, and they present an unparalleled look at life as it was lived behind the White House doors.  This is also the first book to place the Kennedy family within the context of the culture of the early 1960s and tell the story of the president's personal maturity through his evolving family relationships. Historical events like the Cuban Missile Crisis are uniquely viewed from the family's perspective. An appealing combination of history, biography, and popular culture, The Kennedy White House sheds new light on a family that continues to fascinate the American public forty years after they first captivated our attention.",

        "Title": "An Obsession With Butterflies: Our Long Love Affair With A Singular Insect",
        "Authors": "By Russell, Sharman Apt",
        "Description": "Sharman Apt Russell again blends her lush voice and keen scientific eye in this marvelous book about butterflies. From Hindu mythology to Aztec sacrifices, butterflies have served as a metaphor for resurrection and transformation. Even during World War II, children in a Polish death camp scratched hundreds of butterflies onto the walls of their barracks. But as Russell points out in this rich and lyrical meditation, butterflies are above all objects of obsession. From the beastly horned caterpillar, whose blood helps it count time, to the peacock butterfly, with wings that hiss like a snake, Russell traces the butterflies through their life cycles, exploring the creatures' own obsessions with eating, mating, and migrating. In this way, she reveals the logic behind our endless fascination with butterflies as well as the driving passion of such legendary collectors as the tragic Eleanor Glanville, whose children declared her mad because of her compulsive butterfly collecting, and the brilliant Henry Walter Bates, whose collections from the Amazon in 1858 helped develop his theory of mimicry in nature. Russell also takes us inside some of the world's most prestigious natural history museums, where scientists painstakingly catalogue and categorize new species of Lepidoptera, hoping to shed light on insect genetics and evolution. A luminous journey through an exotic world of obsession and strange beauty, this is a book to be treasured by anyone who's ever watched a butterfly mid-flight and thought, as Russell has, \"I've entered another dimension.\"",

        "Title": "A Samba for Sherlock",
        "Authors": "By Soares, Jo and Landers, Clifford E. (TRN)",
        "Description": "Set in Rio de Janeiro in 1886, this internationally acclaimed literary thriller begins with the theft of a Stradivarius violin that has been presented by His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil to one of his more delectable mistresses--a harmless crime in itself but one that mystifies the authorities and (far more important) embarrasses the Emperor.  At the suggestion of Sarah Bernhardt, who is on a triumphant tour through South America, the great Sherlock Holmes is summoned from London to solve the case. But by the time he arrives, events have taken a turn for the worse, as a series of grisly murders shocks the city--the victims all beautiful young women. In each case, the killer leaves his calling card: a violin string entangled in the woman's pubic hair, the corpse stripped of a flap of skin.Holmes (and Dr. Watson, of course) are immediately off on the track of the killer, but although Sherlock succeeds in coining the term \"serial killer,\"  his celebrated powers of deduction don't get him very far with the case itself: overcome by the charm of the tropics, some spectacular digestive difficulties, and the strong appeal of a pretty young actress--at thirty-two, he's not exactly a sexual virtuoso--Sherlock finds himself in a thicker fog than he ever encountered back home in London. And in dark counterpoint to Holmes's questionable ratiocinations and the novel's brilliantly re-created texture of nineteenth-century literary, social, and low-life Rio, is the chilling yet hypnotic voice of the killer himself, a monster of intelligence, evil, and ever-spreading fame. . . .A Samba for Sherlock is the work of a mind of encyclopedic knowledge, caustic wit, brilliant style, and, above all, a formidable ability to entertain.",

        "Title": "If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates",
        "Authors": "By Hightower, Jim",
        "Description": "If anything, in this presidential election special, he's madder than ever!In his earlier bestseller, There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road but Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos, Hightower only began to tap into the deep yearning that Americans have for a new politics that speaks to them from a real-world, kitchen-table perspective. Now, with the year 2000 being an especially significant marker for contemplating our country's direction, not only for the new year but for the new century and the new millennium, it's time for citizens to reclaim their political, economic, and cultural heritage.Leading the way with his hilariously irreverent yet profoundly serious book is our name-naming, podium-pounding, point-them-in-the-right-direction populist, Hightower himself. He whacks conventional wisdom right upside the head,showing,with startling facts and compelling personal stories, that despite a so-called period of prosperity, America's middle class is getting mugged, and that far from being ordained by the gods,globalization is globaloney! Hightower rips the mass off of the candidates, the parties, the consultants, and especially the moneyed powers whoa re supporting all of the leading presidential hopefuls. he's mad about them all--but what he's maddest about, what really gets his goat,is that they are all the same! To paraphrase Jim, American politicians are alike because they don't come cheap. In fact, they're all very expansive. which is why only the rich can own them and why their allegiance is definitely not to regular,worka-day citizens.No one is spared in this insightful and engaging blend of horror and success stories, hard-hitting commentary, laugh-out-loud humor, useful facts, and sparkling language. An equal opportunity muckraker and conscientious agitator for \"We the people,\" Hightower inspires us to take charge again, to build a new politics, and, together, to build a better tomorrow. Jim Hightower's If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates proves yet again that his is a uniquely wise and peerlessly singular voice in the maelstrom of political prattle.",

Ellen Lewin\u2019s unprecedented research on lesbian mothers in the San Francisco area captured a vivid portrait of the moment before gay and lesbian parenting moved into the mainstream of U.S. culture.

        "Authors": "By Brigham, Deirdre Davis, Davis, Adelaide, and Cameron-Sampey, Derry",
        "Description": "This book promises to be the definitive handbook for the behavioral medicine practitioner of the '90s. It is the first book not only to explain the use of imagery as the foundation for designing a behavioral medicine program but also to teach professionals how to design and use imagery to assist their patients with specific illnesses.For those with life-challenging conditions, Getting Well in Orlando, Florida, offers a complete program in bodymind healing, embracing the emotional, the psychological, and the spiritual. Imagery for Getting Well is based on the author's experiences in founding the program and on the experiences of Getting Well's many participants, who have learned to perceive and image their worlds in new ways, totally changing their lives as a result.In addition to sharing the background and philosophy of the program, Brigham explores in depth the synergistic components of the 28-day program: stress management, imagery training, expressive therapies, group and individual therapy, play and laughter, nutrition and exercise, high-level awareness, and much more. Throughout the book, case examples show the healing power of imagery.Clinicians will especially appreciate the detailed scripts and \"seeds for imagery\" for use with a wide range of conditions affecting the immune, endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological systems. Individuals with life-challenging conditions will find here a rich resource for enhancing their healing. As a whole, the book is a blueprint for implementing a behavioral medicine program based on the latest findings in psychoneuroimmunology.A treasure trove of clinical strategies, this book goes beyond the practical to inspire all those in the field of behavioral medicine to embrace the possibilities of imagery for getting well in the most profound sense.",

        "Description": "For Russians, St. Petersburg has embodied power, heroism, and fortitude. It has encompassed all the things that the Russians are and that they hope to become. Opulence and artistic brilliance blended with images of suffering on a monumental scale make up the historic persona of the late W. Bruce Lincoln's lavish \"biography\" of this mysterious, complex city. Climate and comfort were not what Tsar Peter the Great had in mind when, in the spring of 1703, he decided to build a new capital in the muddy marshes of the Neva River delta. Located 500 miles below the Arctic Circle, this area, with its foul weather, bad water, and sodden soil, was so unattractive that only a handful of Finnish fisherman had ever settled there. Bathed in sunlight at midnight in the summer, it brooded in darkness at noon in the winter, and its canals froze solid at least five months out of every year. Yet to the Tsar, the place he named Sankt Pieter Burkh had the makings of a \"paradise.\" His vision was soon borne out: though St. Petersburg was closer to London, Paris, and Vienna than to Russia's far-off eastern lands, it quickly became the political, cultural, and economic center of an empire that stretched across more than a dozen time zones and over three continents. In this book, revolutionaries and laborers brush shoulders with tsars, and builders, soldiers, and statesmen share pride of place with poets. For only the entire historical experience of this magnificent and mysterious city can reveal the wealth of human and natural forces that shaped the modern history of it and the nation it represents.",

In this witty   and lovingly told memoir, Kimmel takes readers back to a time when small-town America   was caught in the amber of the innocent postwar period&apos;people helped their neighbors,   went to church on Sunday, and kept barnyard animals in their backyards.
