        "Authors": "By Nova, Craig",
        "Description": "Craig Nova's novels \"deserve to be ranked among the best American fiction of the past two decades,\" writes Jonathan Yardley in the Washington Post Book World. \"Unlike most of his contemporaries, he isn't content with self-referential miniatures; even when his novels are short, they go after the big questions in a big way. Furthermore, the more he writes the better he gets; at this point in his career, scarcely anyone else is in his league.\"In this, his ninth novel, Nova tells a suspenseful story of modern passion and complex human motives. Set in contemporary Los Angeles against a background of riots and random acts of violence, The Universal Donor evokes a world where life and love are at every turn menaced by unknown forces, not all of them external to ourselves. Like Paul Auster, Joan Didion, or Robert Stone, Nova takes us beneath the sun-soaked, orderly surface of American life and offers a glimpse of something darker and wilder.Virginia Lee is a scientist, a proudly rational woman who acts on what she thinks, never on what she feels. When she marries for reasons more practical than romantic, she is shocked at the \"safety\" with which she's lived her life. She begins to take risks, and soon goes much too far.Terry McKechnie is a physician whose emergency-room cases challenge his sense of what is true about his world, his work, and himself. He is growing numb to his own humanity. Then he meets Virginia.At the center of this couple's story is a freakish accident, a moment of willful carelessness whose complications, both medical and emotional, multiply out of control. At once a thriller, a love story, and a compassionate exploration of moral choices, The Universal Donor is a waking nightmare of a book, bathed in a compelling dream light all its own.",

        "Description": "In today's world of professional sports, where players have egos as inflated as their paychecks, Grant Hill is a unique figure. An All-Star player without the attitude, Grant is changing the look of pro sports. And in this inspiring book, he explains why it's time for all of us to change the game. The son of two highly successful, goal-oriented parents, Grant is the rare athlete who knows that victory is not always about the final score, that taunting is not the same as winning, and that role models can only lead by example. In this intimate look at his childhood, his career, and the people he has met along the way, Grant offers a refreshing viewpoint for today's young people.Change the Game gives us rare insights into a young man growing up talented, sensitive, and smart. Here are scenes from both Grant's sporting life as a young basketball player and his personal life as a shy, quiet teenager who only wanted to fit in. Here are stories of talented athletes undone by drugs; of less talented athletes who channeled their energies to other arenas; and of important adult figures in Grant's life.Whether addressing the topic of fame (\"It is a privilege. It is not a right....And with it comes a serious obligation.\") or bigotry (\"Maybe I can even help wash out some of those hard lines that have been drawn between the races.\"), Grant Hill speaks with the same eloquence and quiet power with which he plays the game.",

        "Description": "For nearly all of human history, our notion of community was centered on the family, tribe, and/or village. The centrality of that notion is at the core of our values. The 20th century brought air travel, a revolution in communications, the internationalization of culture and business, the growth of an \"international language\"--all in all, a complete overturning of our historic understanding of community.As a result, we now have to think about the many different levels and many new faces of community. Our families are nuclear, extended, and broken; few of us live in one place our entire lives, and most of our cities, towns, and regions change beyond recognition every few years. The concept of the nation-state itself is breaking down, and people are more closely identifying with biogegional, religious, or ethnic communities.Incorporating essays from a diverse range of sources such as Parabola, Chronicles:  A Magazine of American Culture, the New Yorker, and The Well, a national computerized bulletin board, Changing Community examines the ways that our ideas of community are evolving.",

Men and boys marched by the thousands and tens of thousands into a conflict that would change the way wars were fought forever. Yet the vast majority of the combatants were neither professional soldiers, nor hired mercenaries. They were citizens - doctors, lawyers, farmers, clerks, and students - who found themselves in an unprecedented kind of combat, brother fighting brother, with the terrible new weapons of the Industrial Age.If the American Civil War was the first modern war, it was also the first war to be documented extensively with photographs. The old daguerrotype, ambro-type, and tintype processes, awkward and demanding though they were, produced remarkably sharp, beautifully modeled images that reach across the decades with undiminished emotional impact. My Brother's Face is a gallery of eighty unforgettable portraits, each introduced by an illuminating historical commentary and accompanied by passages from revealing letters, diaries, or other firsthand accounts expressing the thoughts and feelings of men, women, and boys far from home and in desperate conflict.An intimate view of four terrible years that forged our nation, My Brother's Face depicts the Civil War as seen through the eyes of both the famous and the unknown. Here are the faces of those who fought, those who died, and those who healed, all captured in startling, personal images.",

It is about finding the courage to let someone you love fly free....The phone call came on a snowy December afternoon. Kate was certain it was Joe, the brilliant, visionary man who had been her soulmate, her driving force since the night they met, almost thirty-four years before. What she got was the one call she had never wanted, and didn't expect. As the snow continued to fall, Kate's mind drifted back, to the moment when she and Joe first met. She had been just seventeen and he was young, powerful, dazzling, and different from any man she'd ever known.It was just days before Christmas, 1940. The war is raging in Europe when Kate Jamison makes her debut in New York City. In a room filled with the scions of East Coast society and the leading political figures of the day, it is Joe Allbright who catches Kate's eye. At twenty-nine, Joe is the brilliant protege of Charles Lindbergh, and already a legend in flying circles for his record-breaking speed and state-of-the-art airplane designs. All Kate sees is a tall, strikingly handsome man who seems at once awkward and larger-than-life, like a shining star -- just out of reach. Joe, too, is caught off balance by his response to Kate, seeing in this beautiful young woman vitality and youth, the lifelong soulmate he never expected to find. As the months pass, they will meet again, forging a bond that will set the course of both their lives. Kate will go off to study at Radcliffe. Joe will skyrocket to fame in modern aviation. Joe's planes are his life, his passion. But irresistibly drawn to her, like moth to flame, he always comes back to Kate. Even after the long, dark years of World War II, when Kate was sure she had finally lost him completely, Joe returns. Never willing to stay, always needing to fly away. As planes are for him, Joe is the passion in her life. When the war is over, at twenty-four Kate wants marriage and a family. Joe wants the world, his limitless horizons, and the unique aviation empire he is building. Unwilling to wait any longer, Kate moves on with her life. But when a chance encounter brings them together again, the time has finally come to make a choice, one that will have profound consequences for them both for the rest of their lives. Against a vivid backdrop of war and thrilling innovation, Danielle Steel breathes life into history, weaving an intensely human story that spans three decades, of two intensely different people who, in spite of themselves, are irrevocably woven into the fabric of each other's lives. With rare insight and emotional power, she brings to life a tale of unconditional love, sacrifice, and compromise -- the joining of two remarkable halves into a single, far more powerful whole. It is a novel of extraordinary grace and compassion from a master storyteller, perhaps the best story she has told.",

Part adventure narrative, part love story, this unforgettable novel captures a crucial moment in the history of exploration, the mid-nineteenth-century romance with the mystery of the Arctic. Combining fact and fiction, Andrea Barrett focuses on Erasmus Darwin Wells, a scholar-naturalist accompanying the expedition of the Narwhal. Through his eyes we meet the various crew members and the expedition's blustery commander, obsessed with the search for an open polar sea. And through his eyes we experience the wild, disturbing beauties of that last unexplored region. In counterpoint to his views are those of the Esquimaux, witness to the expedition's exploits, and of the women left behind in Philadelphia, who can only imagine what lies beyond the north wind. Together, those who travel and those who stay weave a web of myth and history. In the real nineteenth-century expeditions, explorers' documents always cast the writer as hero. But what really happened up there, in the long winter darkness, entrapped in ice? On the Narwhal, everyone is frightened, nothing is certain, and heroes emerge in unexpected guises. Barrett's explorers discover-as all explorers do-not what was always there and never needed discovering, but the state of their own souls.",

        "Description": "Jayne Anne Phillips has always been a master of portraiture, both in her widely acclaimed novels and in her short fiction.\u00a0\u00a0The stories in Fast Lanes demonstrated the breadth of her talent in a tour de force of voices, offering elegantly rendered views into the lives of characters torn between the liberation of detachment and the desire to connect.Three stories are collected in this edition for the first time: in \"Alma,\" and adolescent daughter is made the confidante of her lonely mother; \"Counting\" traces the history of a dommed love affair; and \"Callie\" evokes memories of the haunting death of a child in 1920's West Virginia.\u00a0\u00a0Along with the original seven stories from Fast Lanes--each told in extraordinary first person narratives that have been hailed by critics as virtuoso performances--these incandescent portraits offer windows into the lives of an entire generation of Americans, demonstrating again and again why Jayne Anne Phillips remains one of our most powerful writers.",

One of them is the brash young master of a once-great clan. The second is his bookmate, the lame servant chosen to shepherd his bright but unruly master through school. The third, whom they have just befriended, is a prank-playing urchin, a gravekeeper's daughter disguised as a boy. Instinctively and immediately, they pledge a solemn oath: \"We three, though of different clans, bind ourselves to one end. We swear to defend our country and save our people. We cannot undo our separate births, but on the same day we mean to die.\" They vow to remain forever brothers of the \"Middle Heart.\"But it is their destiny - over the years of World War II and the Communist revolution and upheavals - to be again and again separated and reunited, again and again challenged and tested by conflicting loyalties: to ideals, to country, to family; to the love of one's heart, to one's friends, to oneself.",

That the strange inheritance has considerable worth seems obvious -- but what Serena doesn't realize is how many secrets it hides...and how many lives it has already cost.Seeking answers, she turns for professional help to Rarities Unlimited, and specifically to Erik North, a reclusive manuscript appraiser with a passion for the past, its people, and its treasures. But Erik's careful examination of the vellum pages and the agonized jottings of a medieval scribe is raising perplexing questions -- about the true importance of Serena's legacy, the possible location of the remainder of the lost manuscript...and the senseless murder of an eccentric old woman in the blistering beat of California's Mojave Desert.Suddenly, without warning, Serena and Erik find themselves thrust into the center of a lethal firestorm that rages between two worlds...between a past long dead yet living on in an ancient text and a contemporary landscape fraught with peril and terror. Now there is no one they dare trust except each other as they make their way across the concrete and neon deserts of Palm Springs and Los Angeles, getting closer by the minute to a shocking revelation about what really is at stake and how far a killer will go to possess a vanished treasure. In the blink of an eye, Serena Charters and Erik North have become targets of an unseen and determined stalker. And their only hope of survival is to keep moving...A spellbinder that bristles with almost unbearable intensity, Elizabeth Lowell's Moving Target is a masterful tale of intrigue, secrets, danger, and murder -- a breathtaking work that brings one of America's favorite storytellers to an electrifying new level.",

        "Title": "The Secret War Against Hanoi: Kennedy's and Johnson's Use of Spies, Saboteurs, and Covert Warriors In North Vietnam",
        "Authors": "By Shultz, Richard H.",
        "Description": "From 1964 to 1972, the United States executed an extremely secret campaign of covert operations against North Vietnam.  Controlled by the Pentagon's Special Operations Group, under the cover name \"Studies and Observation Group\" (SOG), it was the United States' largest and most complex covert operation since World War II.  Because it was so highly classified and politically sensitive, once the war was over the story of SOG was buried deep in the vaults of the Pentagon--until Dr. Richard H. Shultz, Jr., one of the world's leading experts on SOG's activities in Southeast Asia, began his impressive investigative research and wide-ranging special interviews.  The Secret War Against Hanoi is based on thousands of pages of recently declassified top-secret SOG documents, as well as interviews with sixty officers who ran SOG's covert programs and the senior officials who directed this secret war, including Robert McNamara, Walt Rostow, Richard Helms, William Colby, William Westmoreland, and Victor Krulak.  It is the first-ever definitive and comprehensive account of the covert paramilitary and espionage campaign, with many eye-opening disclosures. Dr. Shultz reveals how in 1963, President Kennedy, dissatisfied with the CIA's ineffective guerrilla operations against North Vietnam, turned over operational control of the covert war to the Pentagon and demanded results.  Despite Kennedy's strong directive, those results were slow in coming.  United States policymakers and the senior military leadership had little interest in or understanding of special operations and resisted any expansion of the secret war.  When SOG finally did get started in January 1964, under newly inaugurated President Johnson, it was constantly hobbled by the micro-management of the National Security Council, State Department, and Pentagon leadership.  Despite these restraints, SOG conducted its intense secret war for eight years, through the Johnson and Nixon administrations, and managed to execute a range of operations, including the dispatch of numerous spies to North Vietnam and creation of a sophisticated triple-cross deception program: psychological warfare through a fabricated guerrilla movement, manipulation of North Vietnamese POWs and kidnapped citizens, and dirty tricks; commando raids against Hanoi's coast and navy; and operations on the Ho Chi Minh Trail to kill enemy soldiers and destroy supplies.  Ultimately, the Pentagon's spies, saboteurs, and secret warriors would produce both spectacular and disastrous results.  There are lessons to be learned from Washington's conduct of the secret war against Hanoi that will be valuable and valid for years to come for presidents who engage in covert special operations to meet twenty-first-century threats to vital U.S. interests.",

        "Title": "Taller Women: A Cautionary Tale",
        "Authors": "By Naumoff, Lawrence",
        "Description": "Does it seem to you that women are taller than they used to be? That men are falling short? That the world is getting stranger?If so you'll be at home in the world of Taller Women, where you'll laugh at what you see, pull away from what you don't dare recognize. But some recognitions you won't be able to avoid.You'll encounter a mother devouring herself at the dinner table, traffic gridlock, Roy Rogers movies, a mysterious gathering of animals, a shipwreck, an innocent's first love, breasts as big as prizewinning watermelons, a pregnant woman on the Irish Sea, a farmhouse in flames, women accused of breaking their own necks in their enthusiasm for making love, and men who hang them off balconies by their hair. You'll meet a good man who treats women badly - his wife, for instance, \"had been too good, too rich, in spirit, in beauty, in strength, in her love for him . . . and in retrospect, he thought, it must have scared the hell out of him.\"Taller Women surprises, enlightens, provokes, and disturbs. It reveals what women discover about men: \"They want you to be sexual, but only with them.\" And vice-versa: \"There's something depressing about a happy woman.\" Wantonness in women, Naumoff tells us, will always be punished. With its heightened sense of reality and devastating social satire, Taller Women is a cautionary tale about possession and cruelty, innocence and love, weakness and desire.",

Brandon Wilson anchors a television newscast that is regularly trounced by reruns of \"The Facts of Life.\" When a new producer, hell-bent on raising channel 13's ratings, decides that his middle-class African-American anchor with a penthouse isn't \"black\" enough, he has a brainstorm: Brandon is to redefine himself by doing a series from a new home in the inner city. There Brandon meets Nita, who manages an apartment building in addition to juggling three kids, night school, and a job.Brandon sees his move as a Faustian bargain that allows him to tell the stories of \"real folks.\" But when the station demands something more sensational, Brandon and Nita find their loyalties caught up in a media circus that only Nita can find a way to tame.With hilarious takes on class, color, and our obsession with seeing ourselves on TV - even if we don't recognize what we see - Live at Five skillfully dissects our media-saturated times. Nita and Brandon wonderfully demonstrate that human lives cannot be captured in sound bites, and that the real story is what happens in our everyday lives.",

        "Description": "In her last tantalizing mystery, Dead Man's Island, award-winning author Carolyn G. Hart gave us a colorful new heroine, seasoned ex-journalist turned sleuth Henrietta O'Dwyer Collins. Now Henrie O is back...this time investigating a brutal murder in a lovely southern town where wealth and privilege mask a hotbed of lies, sex, and deadly desperation....Henrie O is looking forward to a peaceful holiday at her friend Margaret's Tennessee mountain cabin. But Henrie O awakens to find Margaret's nephew, his shirt stained with blood, his handsome face stricken by fear and horror....Craig Matthews swears he didn't kill his wife, swears he didn't lure Patty Kay out to the playhouse on their lavish Fair Haven estate and leave her bloodied and dead. Why, then, did he run away? It's a question the authorities want answered, and when Craig cannot explain away the evidence found at the crime scene or the suspicion that he'd married - and now murdered - for money, Henrie O finds herself drawn into the thick of a life-and-death drama among the privileged residents of Fair Haven.For Margaret's sake she agrees to pursue the investigation and finds that as Craig's \"aunt\" she has instant entree into Fair Haven's best families. But the more Henrie O becomes privy to their deepest fears and most intimate secrets, the more she begins to question their motives. How had they really felt about Patty Kay Prentiss Matthews, a warm, vibrant woman whose forceful personality meant she'd always gotten her way?In this outwardly idyllic town, it seems there are many with reason to feel threatened: not only the widower, who claims he's a hapless victim in a cleverly devised frame-up, but Patty Kay's sullen nymphet of a daughter whose transparent love for her stepfather is anything but innocent; Patty Kay's irresistible ex-husband, who may never have released her; the dead woman's venomous, grasping sister; and even the ingratiating headmaster of the exclusive school where Patty Kay was a trustee.And just when Henrie O feels she's closing in on the truth, another corpse is uncovered - and Henrie O knows time is running out. Now she must play her hunches to untangle this deadly web before she, too, becomes a victim of a mind bent on murder.",
