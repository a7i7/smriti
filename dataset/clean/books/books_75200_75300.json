        "Description": "The multi-national Habsburg empire has never lost its fascination since its fall in 1918. Robin Okey's book shows how the Habsburg peoples experienced the same social, economi, and political processes as most other Europeans, in ways that cast interesting light on these processes from both the European and the Habsburg angle. Opposing views that the national problem was therefore subordinate to underlying socio-economic backwardness, Okey argues for the inextricable entanglement of the two themes, as nationalism emerged from a process of social mobilization which threatened the position of dominant Austro-Germans and Magyars. Robin Okey brings a distinctive approach to an intriguing subject, in a comprehensive study based on wide reading in most of the Monarchy's languages.",

Their mantra: Celebrate perversity, embrace ultra-tolerance, pay rape-a-nations (so-called reparations), support affirmative racism, and provide government subsidies for every illegal who sneaks across the border. In their haste to push failed socialist ideals, the libs have placed us on a crash course of total destruction.\"Even while the heated controversy of his New York Times bestseller, The Savage Nation, still simmers, Michael Savage raises his weapons of matchless wit and moxie again, this time aiming his sights on the liberal assault on our most cherished institutions and taking a stand for our schools, our faith, our police and armed forces, and, most important, our families.It isn't always pretty. You might even at times become uncomfortable. But as you read on, you'll find these pages always contain the Savage truth. That is how to fight the Enemy Within.Filled with riotous rage and blistering humor, this book inspires as it enflames, encouraging Americans to reclaim our country, our government, our national integrity.",

But with breakthrough research that she conducted with fellow Tufts scientists Kristin Baker and Ronenn Roubenoff, Miriam E. Nelson has developed a plan that people can use to actually reverse the pain and immobility that arthritis causes-right in their own homes.  Those people with arthritis who participated in the groundbreaking Tufts study experienced a 43 percent reduction in pain, a 44 percent improvement in physical function, and a 71 percent improvement in strength. This book offers readers the exact same lifestyle \"tools\" that the Tufts team gave its subjects:  * an exercise program designed specifically to protect the joints and ameliorate stiffness and soreness * an eating plan to reduce inflammation and pain * a guide to the latest medications and complementary therapies * strategies for overcoming arthiritis-related depression.",

        "Description": "The number one New York Times bestselling author of Bias delivers another bombshell\u2014this time aimed at . . .100 People Who Are Screwing Up AmericaNo preaching. No pontificating. Just some uncommon sense about the things that have made this country great\u2014and the culprits who are screwing it up.Bernard Goldberg takes dead aim at the America Bashers (the cultural elites who look down their snobby noses at \"ordinary\" Americans) . . . the Hollywood Blowhards (incredibly ditzy celebrities who think they're smart just because they're famous) . . . the TV Schlockmeisters (including the one whose show has been compared to a churning mass of maggots devouring rotten meat) . . . the Intellectual Thugs (bigwigs at some of our best colleges, whose views run the gamut from left wing to far left wing) . . . and many more.Goldberg names names, counting down the villains in his rogues' gallery from 100 all the way to 1\u2014and, yes, you-know-who is number 37. Some supposedly \"serious\" journalists also made the list, including the journalist-diva who sold out her integrity and hosted one of the dumbest hours in the history of network television news. And there are those famous miscreants who have made America a nastier place than it ought to be\u2014a far more selfish, vulgar, and cynical place.But Goldberg doesn't just round up the usual suspects we have come to know and detest. He also exposes some of the people who operate away from the limelight but still manage to pull a lot of strings and do all sorts of harm to our culture. Most of all, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America is about a country where as long as anything goes, as one of the good guys in the book puts it, sooner or later everything will go.This is serious stuff for sure. But Goldberg will also make you laugh as he harpoons scoundrels like the congresswoman who thinks there aren't enough hurricanes named after black people, and the environmentalist to the stars who yells at total strangers driving SUVs\u2014even though she tools around the country in a gas-guzzling private jet.With Bias, Bernard Goldberg took us behind the scenes and exposed the way Big Journalism distorts the news. Now he has written a book that goes even further. This time he casts his eye on American culture at large\u2014and the result is a book that is sure to become the voice of all those Americans who feel that no one is speaking for them on perhaps the most vital issue of all: the kind of country in which we want to live.",

The best-known medieval hymns and prayers are given in their original Latin as well as English.The whole builds into a book for private or small-group devotion to the Blessed Virgin that has no rival for comprehensiveness and usefulness. It will appeal both to those who feel deprived of traditional forms of devotion and to those who are conscious of the increasing significance of the figure of the Virgin in today's world.",

        "Title": "The Broken Teaglass: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Arsenault, Emily",
        "Description": "The dusty files of a venerable dictionary publisher . . . a hidden cache of coded clues . . . a story written by a phantom author . . . an unsolved murder in a gritty urban park\u2013all collide memorably in Emily Arsenault\u2019s magnificent debut, at once a teasing literary puzzle, an ingenious suspense novel, and an exploration of definitions: of words, of who we are, and of the stories we choose to define us.In the maze of cubicles at Samuelson Company, editors toil away in silence, studying the English language, poring over new expressions and freshly coined words\u2013all in preparation for the next new edition of the Samuelson Dictionary. Among them is editorial assistant Billy Webb, just out of college, struggling to stay awake and appear competent. But there are a few distractions. His intriguing coworker Mona Minot may or may not be flirting with him. And he\u2019s starting to sense something suspicious going on beneath this company\u2019s academic facade.Mona has just made a startling discovery: a trove of puzzling citations, all taken from the same book, The Broken Teaglass. Billy and Mona soon learn that no such book exists. And the quotations from it are far too long, twisting, and bizarre for any dictionary. They read like a confessional, coyly hinting at a hidden identity, a secret liaison, a crime. As Billy and Mona ransack the office files, a chilling story begins to emerge: a story about a lonely young woman, a long-unsolved mystery, a moment of shattering violence. And as they piece together its fragments, the puzzle begins to take on bigger personal meaning for both of them, compelling them to redefine their notions of themselves and each other.Charged with wit and intelligence, set against a sweetly cautious love story, The Broken Teaglass is a tale that will delight lovers of words, lovers of mysteries, and fans of smart, funny, brilliantly inventive fiction.",

Together with his lifelong friend Sean, Peter sets out to seek his fortune, embarking upon a journey of danger, disappointment, foreign lands, and excitement.Here is a tale certain to please not only admirers of O'Brian's work but also any reader with an adventurous soul.",

        "Description": "This is the fascinating inside story of the people, forces, politics and diplomacy that have shaped contemporary relations between the United States and China. James Mann, the Beijing bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times from 1984 to 1987, draws on hundreds of newly uncovered government documents, scores of interviews and his own experiences in writing this superb investigative history. Mann begins with an account of the process by which Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger first courted and built up ties to China's Communist government in an attempt to find a way out of the war in Vietnam. At first, the aim was to create flexibility for the United States in dealing with both the Soviet Union and China; but gradually, as the 1970s progressed, the opening to China took on a life and momentum of its own. During the Carter and Reagan administrations, American leaders saw China as an ally against the Soviet Union, and a tacit understanding emerged that the United States would not subject China to the standards and principles applied to other countries. We are shown how subsequent administrations failed to construct a new framework for dealing with China--President Bush tried to preserve the old American relationship with Beijing, and President Clinton has been unsuccessful in his efforts to create something new.Mann also reveals little-known episodes in the history of U.S.-China relations: that the price of\u00a0\u00a0Kissinger's first visit to China in 1971 was a secret promise that the United States would never support independence for Taiwan; how the United States and China worked together in guerrilla operations in Afghanistan and Cambodia; how the movement to restrict China's trade benefits originated and how Bill Clinton came to support these efforts during his1992 presidential campaign. The disclosure of new information, coupled with Mann's incisive and compelling analysis, makes About Face a work that is sure to shed light on the current debate on the United States' relations with China.",

        "Title": "The Birth of a Century: Early Color Photographs of America",
        "Authors": "By Jackson, William Henry, Hughes, Jim, and DETROIT PHOTOGRAPHIC Co. (PHT)",
        "Description": "The final decades of the nineteenth century and the birth of the twentieth in America are illustrated as never before in this book of unique color images that actually predate the invention of color photography. The secret process which produced them combines the delicacy of watercolors with the look and feel of modern color photographs. The pictures are largely the work of the legendary William Henry Jackson, the pioneer photographer who explored the frontiers of the old American west with huge wet-plate cameras and a portable darktent strapped to the back of his trusty mule.Jackson's name is synonymous with high adventure, and Jim Hughes' richly detailed introduction tells a gripping story. Jackson was born in 1843 in New York, and by the 1860s he was on his first trip west, working as a bullwhacker on a wagon train when the nation's unfinished rail lines would take him no further. Finally, on the edge of the western frontier, he began photographing the wild and often spectacularly beautiful landscape of a wilderness soon to be forced into submission by the advancing railroads.Over the next three decades Jackson became the most celebrated of a small and hardy band of pioneer photographers, creating a striking photographic record of the rapidly changing face of America. When his photographs of Yellowstone were credited with helping to persuade Congress to make the region the first National Park, his place in history was secure. From the Rockies to California, from the Great Lakes to the deep South, from teeming New York City to forested New Hampshire these photographs capture both urban and rural landscapes to provide a unique picture of the social and physical evolution of the United States. The book is arranged as a visual tour of the country, and is written with fascinating insights into America's places and politics at the turn of the century.In 1897 Jackson sold the bulk of his enormous archive of photographs to the Detroit Photographic Company, which he joined as a partner. The firm had recently licensed Photochrom, a secret Swiss process for turning black-and-white photographs into color. Completely distinct from today's four-color reproduction, Photochrom is a continuous-tone color rendition of a black-and-white photograph that uses multiple impressions from lithographic stones. The color produced was astonishingly naturalistic, and it was to this process that Jackson devoted his final years of active photography. Gone now was the mule, as he traveled North America in a specially equipped railroad car in search of images to tell the story of the closing of one epoch and the dawning of another.William Henry Jackson died in 1942 after a lifetime that spanned almost the entire history of photography. In recent years, thousands of never distributed Photochrom prints were discovered in a Montana warehouse. This book offers an ample selection of the finest, all published for the first time.",

        "Description": "An INFLUENCER motivates others to change.An INFLUENCER replaces bad behaviors with powerful new skills. An INFLUENCER makes things happen. This is what it takes to be an INFLUENCER.Whether you're a CEO, a parent, or merely a person who wants to make a difference, you probably wish you had more influence with the people in your life. But most of us stop trying to make change happen because we believe it is too difficult, if not impossible. We develop complicated coping strategies when we should be learning the tools and techniques of the world's most influential people.But this is about to change. From the bestselling authors who taught the world how to have Crucial Conversations comes Influencer, a thought-provoking book that combines the remarkable insights of behavioral scientists and business leaders with the astonishing stories of high-powered influencers from all walks of life. You'll be taught each and every step of the influence process-including robust strategies for making change inevitable in your personal life, your business, and your world. You'll learn how to:Identify a handful of high-leverage behaviors that lead to rapid and profound change.Apply strategies for changing both thoughts and actions.Marshall six sources of influence to make change inevitable.Influencer takes you on a fascinating journey from San Francisco to Thailand where you'll see how seemingly \u201cinsignificant\u201d people are making incredibly significant improvements in solving problems others would think impossible. You'll learn how savvy folks make change not only achievable and sustainable, but inevitable. You'll discover why some managers have increased productivity repeatedly and significantly-while others have failed miserably.No matter who you are, or what you do, you'll never learn a more valuable or important set of principles and skills. Once you tap into the power of influence, you can reach out and help others work smarter, grow faster, live, look, and feel better, even save lives. The sky is the limit\u2026for an Influencer.Are you an Influencer ?Find out at www.influencerbook.com\u201dYou don't have to be a manager to realize that no one likes being told what to do. Yet lectures are still the main way we try to get people to change their behavior. Fortunately, social learning academics have been studying alternatives for decades. Patterson and his fellow consultants have now collected their findings in this engaging, example-rich book. The key message is hardly new, but it has gotten more sophisticated: Managers need to get out of the way and facilitate, not manage, the process of change for employees. They can do this by offering vicarious experiences, restructured environments, peer pressure, and frequent tests-all geared so that people embrace the change as authentic to them, not imposed by an outsider. Missing are only success stories of organizations that persuaded managers to drop their controlling habits and choose to be mere facilitators.\u201d-John T. Landry, Harvard Business Review",

        "Description": "Bram Stoker's Dracula is the prototypical horror novel, an inspiration for the world's seemingly limitless fascination with vampires. Though many have tried to replicate Stoker's horror classic - in books, television shows, and movies - only the 1931 Bela Lugosi film bore the Stoker family's support. Until now.Dracula The Un-Dead is a bone-chilling sequel based on Bram Stoker's own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition. Dracula The Un-Dead begins in 1912, twenty-five years after Dracula \"crumbled into dust.\" Van Helsing's protege, Dr. Jack Seward, is now a disgraced morphine addict obsessed with stamping out evil across Europe. Meanwhile, an unknowing Quincey Harker, the grown son of Jonathan and Mina, leaves law school for the London stage, only to stumble upon the troubled production of \"Dracula,\" directed and produced by Bram Stoker himself.The play plunges Quincey into the world of his parents' terrible secrets, but before he can confront them he experiences evil in a way he had never imagined. One by one, the band of heroes that defeated Dracula a quarter-century ago is being hunted down. Could it be that Dracula somehow survived their attack and is seeking revenge? Or is their another force at work whose relentless purpose is to destroy anything and anyone associated with Dracula?Dracula The Un-Dead is deeply researched, rich in character, thrills and scares, and lovingly crafted as both an extension and celebration of one of the most classic popular novels in literature.",

        "Title": "The Last Empress: Madame Chiang Kai-shek and the Birth of Modern China",
        "Authors": "By Pakula, Hannah",
        "Description": "With the beautiful, powerful, and sexy Madame Chiang Kai-shek at the center of one of the great dramas of the twentieth century, this is the story of the founding of modern China, starting with a revolution that swept away more than 2,000 years of monarchy, followed by World War II, and ending in the eventual loss to the Communists and exile in Taiwan.   An epic historical tapestry, this wonderfully wrought narrative brings to life what Americans should know about China -- the superpower we are inextricably linked with -- the way its people think and their code of behavior, both vastly different from our own.   The story revolves around this fascinating woman and her family: her father, a peasant who raised himself into Shanghai society and sent his daughters to college in America in a day when Chinese women were kept purposefully uneducated; her mother, an unlikely Methodist from the Mandarin class; her husband, a military leader and dogmatic warlord; her sisters, one married to Sun Yat-sen, the George Washington of China, the other to a seventy-fifth lineal descendant of Confucius; and her older brother, a financial genius.   This was the Soong family, which, along with their partners in marriage, was largely responsible for dragging China into the twentieth century. Brilliantly narrated, this fierce and bloody drama also includes U.S. Army General Joseph Stilwell; Claire Chennault, head of the Flying Tigers; Communist leaders Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai; murderous warlords; journalists Henry Luce, Theodore White, and Edgar Snow; and the unfortunate State Department officials who would be purged for predicting (correctly) the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.   As the representative of an Eastern ally in the West, Madame Chiang was befriended -- before being rejected -- by the Roosevelts, stayed in the White House for long periods during World War II, and charmed the U.S. Congress into giving China billions of dollars. Although she was dubbed the Dragon Lady in some quarters, she was an icon to her people and is certainly one of the most remarkable women of the twentieth century.",

Dwight Eisenhower was President, but in my life it was the diminutive, intense Sister Mary Lurana who ruled, at least in the third-grade class where I was held captive. For reasons you will soon understand, my parents had remanded me to the penal institution of St. Brigid\u2019s School in Westbury, New York, a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one. Already, I had barely survived my first two years at St. Brigid\u2019s because I was, well, a little nitwit. Not satisfied with memorizing the Baltimore Catechism\u2019s fine prose, which featured passages like \u201cGod made me to show his goodness and to make me happy with him in heaven,\u201d I was constantly annoying my classmates and, of course, the no-nonsense Sister Lurana. With sixty overactive students in her class, she was understandably short on patience. For survival, she had also become quick on the draw.Then it happened. One day I blurted out some dumb remark, and Sister Lurana was on me like a panther. Her black habit blocked out all distractions as she leaned down, looked me in the eye, and uttered words I have never forgotten: \u201cWilliam, you are a bold, fresh piece of humanity.\u201dAnd she was dead-on.One day in 1957, in the third-grade classroom of St. Brigid\u2019s parochial school, an exasperated Sister Mary Lurana bent over a restless young William O\u2019Reilly and said, \u201cWilliam, you are a bold, fresh piece of humanity.\u201d Little did she know that she was, early in his career as a troublemaker, defining the essence of Bill O\u2019Reilly and providing him with the title of his brash and entertaining issues-based memoir. And this time it\u2019s personal. In his most intimate book yet, O\u2019Reilly goes back in time to examine the people, places, and experiences that launched him on his journey from working-class kid to immensely influential television personality and bestselling author. Readers will learn how his traditional outlook was formed in the crucible of his family, his neighborhood, his church, and his schools, and how his views on America\u2019s proper role in the world emerged from covering four wars on five continents over three-plus decades as a news correspondent. What will delight his numerous fans and surprise many others is the humor and self-deprecation with which he handles one of his core subjects: himself, and just how O\u2019Reilly became O\u2019Reilly.",

The Book Lust audience is committed to reading, and here is a smart and entertaining tool for picking the best books for kids. Divided into three sections\u2014Easy Books, Middle-Grade Readers, and Young Adult\u2014Nancy Pearl makes wonderful reading connections by theme, setting, voice, and ideas. For horse lovers, she reminds us of the mainstays in the category (Black Beauty, Misty of Chincoteague, etc.) but then in a creative twist connects Mr. Revere and I to the list. In a list called Chapter One, she answers the proverbial question: which chapters books are the most compelling for kids who are now ready to move beyond picture books. And who says picture books aren\u2019t deep? Recommended Folk Tales sort out many of life\u2019s dilemmas and issues of good and bad; a selection of picture books on Death and Dying introduces this topic with sensitivity; and You\u2019ve Got a Friend offers up books for early readers that show the complexities and the pleasures of relating to others. Parents, teachers, and librarians are often puzzled by the unending choices for reading material for young people. It starts when the kids are toddler and doesn\u2019t end until high-school graduation. What\u2019s good, what\u2019s trash, what\u2019s going to hold their interest?
