Now millions of women concerned about aging must decide whether or not to undergo synthetic hormone replacement therapy-and suffer its side effects and increased health risks. Hundreds of thousands of women have listened to Dr. Lee's potentially life-saving advice and followed his groundbreaking, natural hormone program-experiencing amazing results. Newly revised and updated, this revolutionary book has the latest research, and Dr. Lee's effective plan for restoring balance using bioidentical hormones, including natural progesterone. Discover the benefits of his breakthrough program: * Reduce or eliminate premenopausal and menopausal symptoms * Help eliminate hormone-related problems such as osteoporosis, hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, weight gain, and fibrocystic breasts * Reduce \"middle age\" weight gain * Help restore sex drive * Protect against breast cancer * Maintain mental acuity * Help stop and reverse osteoporosis * Restore energy and vibrancy...slow the signs of aging.",

        "Description": "Why is organizational change so hard? Because in order to make any transformation successful, you must change more than just the structure and operations of an organization?you need to change people\u2019s behavior. And that is never easy.The Heart of Change is your guide to helping people think and feel differently in order to meet your shared goals. According to bestselling author and renowned leadership expert John Kotter and coauthor Dan Cohen, this focus on connecting with people\u2019s emotions is what will spark the behavior change and actions that lead to success. The Heart of Change is the engaging and essential complement to John Kotter\u2019s international bestseller Leading Change.Building off of Kotter\u2019s revolutionary eight-step process, this book vividly illustrates how large-scale business change can work. With real-life stories of people in organizations, the authors show how teams and individuals get motivated and activated to overcome obstacles to change?and produce spectacular results. Kotter and Cohen argue that change initiatives often fail because leaders rely too exclusively on data and analysis to get buy-in from their teams instead of creatively showing or doing something that appeals to their emotions and inspires them to spring into action. They call this the see-feel-change dynamic, and it is crucial for the success of any true organizational transformation.Refreshingly clear and eminently practical, The Heart of Change is required reading for anyone facing change and looking to build their leadership skills.Published by Harvard Business Review Press.",

In Pursuit of Justice, she tells the David-and-Goliath story of Rebecca Morland, a young attorney who finds herself pitted against powerful legal and financial giants.  Rebecca Morland had a rosy future. She and her husband, Ryan, recently named a partner at one of Los Angeles's most prestigious law firms, were happy together and making plans to start a family. Then one night at a party, on a yacht owned by a wealthy and politically ambitious businessman, Ryan vanished. Two days later his body was found, and Rebecca's life was irrevocably turned upside down.  Suddenly she is faced with the question: How well did she know her husband? Were the rumors true that he had been depressed and drinking heavily the night he disappeared? Did he in fact embezzle funds from the law firm? Rebecca had sensed he was keeping something from her, but she has no idea what it could have been. When the police are only too happy to close the case, calling it a suicide, Rebecca refuses to accept that verdict.  Determined to find out what really happened to her husband, Rebecca sets out to discover the truth. What she doesn't realize is that in her pursuit of justice, she is putting her own life in grave danger.  Clearly someone wanted her husband out of the way; will they now succeed in stopping her as well?  There is no shortage of suspects...  Brandon Taylor: Head of the law firm of Taylor, Dennison & Evans and a candidate for California's open Senate seat. He had been Ryan's mentor and had recently named Ryan as his campaign manager. Was Brandon really the benign father figure that he appears to be?  Catherine Dennison: Another partner in the firm and a tenacious trial lawyer to whom winning is everything. As Ryan's rival and jealous ex-lover, she had a need for power. Did it drive her over the edge?  John Evans: Brandon's conniving nephew had always resented his uncle's affection for Ryan. Did his conviction that heading the law firm was his birthright give him a motive to take Ryan out of the picture?  Paul Worthington: Multimillionaire real-estate developer and Brandon's political opponent, whose dreams go beyond the Senate. His popularity had shot up in the polls since Ryan's death. Ryan disappeared from his yacht. Was Paul in any way responsible? And then there is his elegant socialite wife, Diana. To what lengths would she have gone to aid and abet her husband's ambitions?  Maxwell Holmes: A sinister political insider, aware of everyone's secrets and not above using them for his own advantage. Powerful and determined enough to put the man he wants in the Senate. Did Ryan get in his way?  With a cast of characters as intriguing and glamorous as they are devious and cunning, Pursuit of Justice keeps the reader turning the pages until the last",

        "Description": "With \"careful prose and a tone of humble striving\" (New York Times Book Review), this revelatory first novel by a cloistered monk traces a young man's search for wisdom among the inhabitants of a Cistercian monastery. In 1973, Paul Seneschal, a shy nineteen-year-old from rural Manitoba, takes flight from the world behind the wrought iron gates of St. Norbert Abbey. Here forty monks grow their own food, wake at three in the morning to pray, and converse largely through a spare but expressive vocabulary of hand signals. Renamed Brother Antoine, Paul strives for wisdom and holiness, yet life within the cloister can't block out all of humanity's foibles. One monk lapses into pyromania; another, a French Canadian, attacks any English-speaker who gets too close; another resembles \"a bald Martha Ray.\" We soon see that even in this rarefied realm, human folly nestles cheek by jowl with the divine. A wise yet refreshingly humorous account of a life of faith, ALL WE KNOW OF HEAVEN offers an a fascinating glimpse into a quiet world that very few people know about.",

They pitch drugs with video games and soft cuddly toys for children; promote them in churches and subways, at NASCAR races and state fairs. They\u2019ve become experts at promoting fear of disease, just so they can sell us hope. \u00a0No question: drugs can save lives. But the relentless marketing that has enriched corporate executives and sent stock prices soaring has come with a dark side. Prescription pills taken as directed by physicians are estimated to kill one American every five minutes. And that figure doesn\u2019t reflect the damage done as the overmedicated take to the roads. \u00a0Our Daily Meds connects the dots for the first time to show how corporate salesmanship has triumphed over science inside the biggest pharmaceutical companies and, in turn, how this promotion driven industry has taken over the practice of medicine and is changing American life. \u00a0It is an ageless story of the battle between good and evil, with potentially life-changing consequences for everyone, not just the 65 percent of Americans who unscrew a prescription cap every day. An industry with the promise to help so many is now leaving a legacy of needless harm.",

        "Description": "Deftly written and emotionally powerful, Drowning Ruth is a stunning portrait of the ties that bind sisters together and the forces that tear them apart, of the dangers of keeping secrets and the explosive repercussions when they are exposed. A mesmerizing and achingly beautiful debut.Winter, 1919. Amanda Starkey spends her days nursing soldiers wounded in the Great War. Finding herself suddenly overwhelmed, she flees Milwaukee and retreats to her family's farm on Nagawaukee Lake, seeking comfort with her younger sister, Mathilda, and three-year-old niece, Ruth. But very soon, Amanda comes to see that her old home is no refuge--she has carried her troubles with her. On one terrible night almost a year later, Amanda loses nearly everything that is dearest to her when her sister mysteriously disappears and is later found drowned beneath the ice that covers the lake. When Mathilda's husband comes home from the war, wounded and troubled himself, he finds that Amanda has taken charge of Ruth and the farm, assuming her responsibility with a frightening intensity. Wry and guarded, Amanda tells the story of her family in careful doses, as anxious to hide from herself as from us the secrets of her own past and of that night.Ruth, haunted by her own memory of that fateful night, grows up under the watchful eye of her prickly and possessive aunt and gradually becomes aware of the odd events of her childhood. As she tells her own story with increasing clarity, she reveals the mounting toll that her aunt's secrets exact from her family and everyone around her, until the heartrending truth is uncovered.Guiding us through the lives of the Starkey women, Christina Schwarz's first novel shows her compassion and a unique understanding of the American landscape and the people who live on it.",

Now in The Sneaky Chef, Lapine presents over 75 recipes that ingeniously disguise the most important superfoods inside kids&#39; favorite meals.

Through the fourteen tales featured in Stardust on My Pillow, Patsy sensitively explores the themes of compassion and kindness, holiness and hope, while providing beautifully written inspiration for all of us who desire to spread a little stardust of our own.

Shaw Originally composed in Old French, the two chronicles brought together here offer some of the most vivid and reliable accounts of the Crusades from a Western perspective. Villehardouin's Conquest of Constantinople, distinguished by its simplicity and lucidity, recounts the controversial Fourth Crusade, which descended into an all-out attack on the E astern Christians of Byzantium. In Life of Saint Louis, Joinville draws on his close attachment to King Louis IX of France to recall his campaigning in the Holy Land. Together these narratives comprise a fascinating window on events that, for all their remoteness, offer startling similarities to our own age.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

        "Authors": "By Naslund, Sena Jeter and Wormell, Christopher (ILT)",
        "Description": "From the opening line--\"Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last\"--you will know that you are in the hands of a masterful storyteller and in the company of a fascinating woman hero. Inspired by a brief passage in Melville's Moby-Dick, where Captain Ahab speaks passionately of his young wife on Nantucket, Una Spenser's moving tale \"is very much Naslund's own and can be enjoyed independently of its source.\" (Newsday) The daughter of a tyrannical father, Una leaves the violent Kentucky frontier for the peace of a New England lighthouse island, where she simultaneously falls in love with two young men. Disguised as a boy, she earns a berth on a whaling ship where she encounters the power of nature, death, and madness, and gets her first glimpse of Captain Ahab. As Naslund portrays Una's love for the tragically driven Ahab, she magnificently renders a real, living marriage and offers a new perspective on the American experience. Immediately immersed in this world, the reader experiences a brilliantly written, vibrant, uplifting novel--a bright book of life. Ahab's Wife was a main selection of the Book of the Month Club, chosen by Time magazine as one of the top five novels of 1999, selected by Book Sense as one of the top five books of the year, chosen by the New York Times as a Notable Book of 1999, and chosen as a Best Book by Publishers Weekly.Ahab's Wife is being reprinted in Australia and England, translated into German, Hebrew, Spanish and Portuguese.",

In Disappointment with God, he poses three questions that Christians wonder but seldom ask aloud: Is God unfair? Is he silent? Is he hidden? This insightful and deeply personal book points to the odd disparity between our concept of God and the realities of life. Why, if God is so hungry for relationship with us, does he seem so distant? Why, if he cares for us, do bad things happen? What can we expect from him after all? Yancey answers these questions with clarity, richness, and biblical assurance. He takes us beyond the things that make for disillusionment to a deeper faith, a certitude of God's love, and a thirst to reach not just for what God gives, but for who he is.",

        "Description": "With this exhilarating novel from the author the San Francisco Chronicle calls \"daring\" and \"splendid,\" Sarah Smith cuts to the heart of one of literature's most fascinating and enduring mysteries: the enigma of Sir William Shakespeare.  Meet Joe Roper, a thoroughly modern graduate student who has landed the job of a lifetime working in the famed Kellogg Collection of Elizabethan texts and curiosities. He's been passionate about Shakespeare since reading a duct-taped paperback copy of Macbeth as a kid. But if all the world's a stage, Joe's working-class roots do little to prepare him for his role in the academic arena. Enter Posy Gould, stage right. A glamorous rising star at Harvard, she insists that a letter Joe's found, signed by one W. Shakespeare of Stratford, is a career-making discovery for them both -- particularly because the letter suggests that the plays were not written from Shakespeare's quill. What follows is a literary adventure story that places Joe and Posy in a world where the London Eye looks out over Shakespeare's city, Hollywood producers rub elbows with the Queen's court, and an unsolved mystery spans across five centuries and two continents. A first-rate thriller from one of the masters of the genre, Chasing Shakespeares is also an enduring tale about love, art, and poetic justice.",

In Swan, her first novel, she has created an equally intimate world, rich with striking characters and intriguing twists of fate, that hearkens back to her southern roots.The Masons are a prominent but now fragmented family who have lived for generations in Swan, an edenic, hidebound small town in Georgia. As Swan opens, a bizarre crime pulls Ginger Mason home from her life as an archeologist in Italy: The body of her mother, Catherine, a suicide nineteen years before, has been mysteriously exhumed. Reunited on new terms with her troubled, isolated brother J.J., who has never ventured far from Swan, the Mason children grapple with the profound effects of their mother's life and death on their own lives. When a new explanation for Catherine\u2019s death emerges, and other closely guarded family secrets rise to the surface as well, Ginger and J.J. are confronted with startling truths about their family, a particular ordeal in a family and a town that wants to keep the past buried.Beautifully evoking the rhythms and idiosyncrasies of the deep South while telling an utterly compelling story of the complexity of family ties, Swan marks the remarkable fiction debut of one of America\u2019s best-loved writers.",
