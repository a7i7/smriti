A number of delightful deceits and hilarious turns of plot must be played out before the mating strategies of both Kate Hardcastle and her friend Constance Neville conclude happily. Along the way, there is an abundance of merry mix-ups, racy dialogue and sly satire of the sentimental comedies of Goldsmith's day.The extraordinary humor and humanity with which Goldsmith invested this play have made it one of the most read, performed, and studied of all English comedies. It is now available in this inexpensive Dover edition, based on the text of the fourth edition, published in the year of the play's first staging.",

        "Authors": "By Williams, Joseph M., Turabian, Kate L., Booth, Wayne C., and Colomb, Gregory G.",
        "Description": "Dewey. Bellow. Strauss. Friedman. The University of Chicago has been the home of some of the most important thinkers of the modern age. But perhaps no name has been spoken with more respect than Turabian. The dissertation secretary at Chicago for decades, Kate Turabian literally wrote the book on the successful completion and submission of the student paper. Her Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, created from her years of experience with research projects across all fields, has sold more than seven million copies since it was first published in 1937.Now, with this seventh edition, Turabian\u2019s Manual has undergone its most extensive revision, ensuring that it will remain the most valuable handbook for writers at every level\u2014from first-year undergraduates, to dissertation writers apprehensively submitting final manuscripts, to senior scholars who may be old hands at research and writing but less familiar with new media citation styles. Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams, and the late Wayne C. Booth\u2014the gifted team behind The Craft of Research\u2014and the University of Chicago Press Editorial Staff combined their wide-ranging expertise to remake this classic resource. They preserve Turabian\u2019s clear and practical advice while fully embracing the new modes of research, writing, and source citation brought about by the age of the Internet.Booth, Colomb, and Williams significantly expand the scope of previous editions by creating a guide, generous in length and tone, to the art of research and writing. Growing out of the authors\u2019 best-selling Craft of Research, this new section provides students with an overview of every step of the research and writing process, from formulating the right questions to reading critically to building arguments and revising drafts. This leads naturally to the second part of the Manual for Writers, which offers an authoritative overview of citation practices in scholarly writing, as well as detailed information on the two main citation styles (\u201cnotes-bibliography\u201d and \u201cauthor-date\u201d). This section has been fully revised to reflect the recommendations of the fifteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style and to present an expanded array of source types and updated examples, including guidance on citing electronic sources.The final section of the book treats issues of style\u2014the details that go into making a strong paper. Here writers will find advice on a wide range of topics, including punctuation, table formatting, and use of quotations. The appendix draws together everything writers need to know about formatting research papers, theses, and dissertations and preparing them for submission. This material has been thoroughly vetted by dissertation officials at colleges and universities across the country.This seventh edition of Turabian\u2019s Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations is a classic reference revised for a new age. It is tailored to a new generation of writers using tools its original author could not have imagined\u2014while retaining the clarity and authority that generations of scholars have come to associate with the name Turabian.",

        "Title": "Emily Post's Etiquette (16th Edition)",
        "Authors": "By Post, Peggy",
        "Description": "Earlier in this century people turned to Emily Post for etiquette advice about the way they lived in the rapidly changing age known as the Roaring Twenties. As we prepare to enter a new millennium people continue to turn to Emily Post for advice on etiquette and manners. While etiquette remains a code of behavior based on kindness, consideration and unselfishness that does not change, our manners, the practice of etiquette, must change as our world changes. The world of today is both vasdy different and astonishingly the same as the world Emily Post herself knew. Seventy-five years after Emily Post wrote her groundbreaking book, Peggy Post, her great-grand-daughter-in-law, has thoroughly revised and updated Emily Post's Etiquette to take us into the next century.The hallmarks that define Emily Post's Etiquette as an indispensable resource remain: the correct table-setting for an intimate dinner party of eight, the proper response to a formal third-person invitation, and of course, all the details of planning a wedding. But in a world where our neighbors and coworkers are as likely to come from the other side of the globe as the other side of town, changes both subde and radical are necessary in our manners. In addition to a chapter devoted to doing business internationally, readers find not only advice for visiting those from other cultures living in our country, but also guidance on wearing ethnic clothing when traveling in other countries. Previous editions have explained the traditions of Christianity and Judaism but now for the first time readers learn about birth and death ceremonies of Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. Sports participants who used to read only about the etiquette of golf, tennis, skiing and sailing, now learn about in-line skating and snowboarding as well.Emily Post's Etiquette, is not just for your grandmothers generation. It's for all of us.",

And you think to yourself: It could have been us. And you start to wonder: What if we\u2019re next?Linwood Barclay, critically acclaimed author of No Time for Goodbye, brings terror closer than ever before in a thriller where murder strikes in the place we feel safest of all. Promise Falls isn\u2019t the kind of community where a family is shot to death in their own home. But that is exactly what happened to the Langleys one sweltering summer night, and no one in this small upstate New York town is more shocked than their next-door neighbors, Jim and Ellen Cutter. They visited for the occasional barbecue and their son, Derek, was friends with the Langleys\u2019 boy, Adam; but how well did they really know their neighbors? That\u2019s the question Jim Cutter is asking, and the answers he\u2019s getting aren\u2019t reassuring. Albert Langley was a successful, well-respected criminal lawyer, but was he so good at getting criminals off that he was the victim of revenge\u2014a debt his innocent family also paid in blood? From the town\u2019s criminally corrupt mayor to the tragic suicide of a talented student a decade before, Promise Falls has more than its share of secrets. And Jim Cutter, failed artist turned landscaper, need look no further than his own home and his wife Ellen\u2019s past to know that things aren\u2019t always what they seem. But not even Jim and Ellen are ready to know that their son was in the Langley house the night the family was murdered.Suddenly the Cutters must face the unthinkable: that a murderer isn\u2019t just stalking too close to home but is inside it already. For the Langleys weren\u2019t the first to die and they won\u2019t be the last.",

Struggling to make ends meet, she works full-time as the nanny for the fabulously wealthy Turnbull family, looking after their two wonderful children and waiting for her glamorous life as a New York photographer to begin. When her photographs are considered by an elite Manhattan art gallery, it seems she might finally get the chance that will start her career.  But Kristin has a major distraction: forbidden love. The man of her dreams is almost hers for keeps. Breathless with an inexhaustible passion and the excitement of being within reach of her goals, Kristen ignores all signs of catastrophe brewing. Fear exists for a reason. And Kristin can only dismiss the warnings for so long. Searching desperately for the truth through the lens of her camera, she can only hope that it's not too late. This novel of psychological suspense is a stunning achievement for thriller master James Patterson, \"one of the bestselling writers in history\" (New York Sun).",

The compelling and continuing chronicle of Abram Ebersol's family, beginning in the mid-1940s, moves forward in time and scope to the late 50s. The devout Ebersols have faced sometimes-painful divisions and separations--if not geographical, those of the heart. Leah, possibly most of all, has borne losses and revelations that would have undone another whose faith was not firmly established in the God her beloved mother knew so fervently. Leah also has endured the ultimate test of her fortitude, the unexpected return of her shunned sister, Sadie, and the renewed sense of betrayal that arrives home with her. But since the close of The Sacri\u00c2\u00b9ce, Leah has occupied her heart and hands with the overseeing of the Ebersol Cottage and the raising of her motherless younger siblings. This includes vivacious Lydiann, who has arrived at the traditional rumschpringe, the time for testing her wings and her willingness to commit to the Old Ways. Will she take the sorrowful path of her older sister Sadie, or will Mamma Leah's good judgment guide Lydiann safely to her baptismal covenant?",

Ripped from her home first during the Japanese occupation and again during the bloody civil war that divided her country, Hongyong fought to save her family by drawing from her own talents and values. Over the years she proved her spirit indomitable, providing for her husband children by running a successful restaurant, building a profitable opium business, and eventually becoming adept at the healing art of ch\u2019iryo. When she was forced to leave her country, she moved her family to California, where she reestablished her ch\u2019iryo practice. Writing in her grandmother\u2019s voice, Helie Lee recreates an individual experience in a unique culture that is both seductively exotic and strangely familiar. With wit and verve, she claims her own Korean identity and illuminates the intricate experiences of Asian-American women in this century.",

With exquisite grace and eloquence, T\u00f3ib\u00edn writes of men and women bound by convention, by unspoken emotions, by the stronghold of the past. Many are trapped in lives they would not choose again, if they ever chose at all.   A man buries his mother and converts his grief to desire in one night. A famous singer captivates an audience, yet cannot beguile her own estranged son. And in \"A Long Winter,\" Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's finest piece of cction to date, a young man searches for his mother in the snow-covered mountains where she has sought escape from the husband who controls and confines her.   Winner of numerous awards for his fifth novel, The Master -- including the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award -- T\u00f3ib\u00edn brings to this stunning first collection an acute understanding of human frailty and longing.

        "Authors": "By Gigliotti, Jim and Johnston, Daryl",
        "Description": "Daryl Johnston?2s name and voice are known to millions of television viewers who hear his insightful commentary on NFL telecasts each week during the football season. But football fans first learned to love him years ago, when ?3Moose?4 was a crowd favorite on the Dallas Cowboys?2 Super Bowl championship teams of the 1990s. A bruising fullback with an unyielding work ethic, Johnston enjoyed the respect of teammates and fans in Dallas almost from the moment he joined the club as a second-round draft pick out of Syracuse in 1989. He earned national recognition in 1993, when he became the first blocking fullback selected to represent the NFC in the annual Pro Bowl game. Moose?2s blocking helped the Cowboys win three Super Bowls in four years from 1992 to 1995, and helped pave the way for Dallas running back Emmitt Smith to ascend to the top of the NFL?2s all-time rushing charts. Johnston was a thinking man?2s football player?7an athlete determined to get the most out of his abilities by outsmarting his opponent as well as outhitting him. And when he retired from football following the 1999 season, he brought that same competitive edge to his role as a television analyst, first for CBS in 2000, then for Fox Sports since 2001. In 2004, he was teamed with veteran Dick Stockton and former NFL defensive star Tony Siragusa on one of Fox?2s most popular announcing crews. Daryl knows that spectators who just follow the football are missing much of the game. We can all see the quarterback hand the ball to the running back, and the linebacker make the tackle. But there are 22 guys in motion on every play. In Watching Football, Moose draws upon his playing experience and years of expert analysis on television to bring the entire field into focus. So the next time you tune in an NFL or college game on television, you?2ll know what?2s coming?7almost before the players do!",

        "Description": "Mark Fenton, television personality and author of the best-selling Complete Guide to Walking, teams up with top exercise researcher, David R. Bassett, to help readers get moving. These guys know what works, and they''ve got pedometers on the brain. During the last ten years, pedometer use has grown exponentially. \"Step counting\" broke into the exercise vocabulary when Oprah started sporting her own pedometer, and the mania has only grown. Ten years ago there were five pedometers on the market; today there are dozens. But what to do with them? Hearing the cries for solid information, authors David R. Bassett and Mark Fenton have stepped up.  Covered in this guide are a history of step counting--Jefferson was a fan, and a pedometer was designed by Leonardo da Vinci--advice on choosing a pedometer, and a guide to starting a pedometer program, with looks at successful ones in the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Most important may be the chapters treating the tremendously successful 10,000-steps-per-day programs initiated in Japan, as well as the modifications it needs to work for children and senior citizens.   Aside from the pedometer itself, Pedometer Walking may be one of the most important exercise tools in years.",

        "Title": "False Profits: The Inside Story of BCCI, The World\u0092s Most Corrupt Financial Empire",
        "Authors": "By Truell, Peter and Gurwin, Larry",
        "Description": "The deception began with its name, for the Bank of Credit and Commerce International was never truly a bank. BCCI was, from the start, a monstrous fraud: behind a convincing facade, a shadowy group of Pakistani financiers and Arab sheikhs organized a criminal enterprise of unprecedented proportions. Now, in this authoritative book, two award-winning journalists tell the shocking story of how BCCI used an array of schemes to steal billions of dollars and ultimately buy political influence in the United States and around the world.BCCI's charismatic founder, Agha Hasan Abedi, liked to speak about his bank's \"moral mission.\" BCCI would be the first global Third World bank, a financial institution committed to aiding people in developing countries. Instead, Abedi and his allies did exactly the opposite, robbing innocent depositors of their savings, assisting dictators in the looting of their countries' treasuries, and doing a brisk business with terrorists and drug lords. With the help of Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, and other notorious villains, BCCI built an empire that operated in seventy-three countries and controlled $30 billion in deposits.But BCCI also had a political agenda: by secretly taking over the largest banking institution in Washington, D.C., and corrupting a host of powerful politicians, the bank's backers tried to influence U.S. policy in the Middle East. To the men from BCCI, Washington was a city for sale, and here for the first time are full accounts of BCCI's troubling relationships with Clark Clifford, Jimmy Carter, Orrin Hatch, and several members of George Bush's administration and family. The authors also explore the bank's ties to the murky world of intelligence, and prove that both the CIA and Saudi Arabia's intelligence agency were deeply involved in BCCI - perhaps from the beginning.How did this criminal rampage last for nearly twenty years? Rarely was BCCI hindered by regulators or law enforcement officials; even after the bank was shutdown, investigations by the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department were sluggish at best. The authors explain why, and show that if not for the efforts of a few intrepid investigators BCCI could still be bribing its way through the corridors of power.Peter Truell and Larry Gurwin have been on BCCI's trail for over a decade, and their book at last reveals the full scope of this horrific scandal. False Profits is a riveting story, an explosive expose, and a disturbing illustration of the ease with which our country's leaders and political institutions can be corrupted.",

But no matter how far he walks, no matter how exhausting his days, the painful memories of Helen's death do not diminish. On the forty-third day of his walk, at the base of a cliff, Lynley discovers the body of a young man who appears to have fallen to his death. The closest town, better known for its tourists and its surfing than its intrigue, seems an unlikely place for murder. However, it soon becomes apparent that a clever killer is indeed at work, and this time Lynley is not a detective but a witness and possibly a suspect.The head of the vastly understaffed local police department needs Lynley's help, though, especially when it comes to the mysterious, secretive woman whose cottage lies not far from where the body was discovered. But can Lynley let go of the past long enough to solve a most devious and carefully planned crime?",

They made three other flights the same day, the final lasting 59 seconds for a distance over the ground of 852 feet. The world would never be the same after that day. Mankind was finally off the ground in powered flight. And man's experiences in the air would forevermore join the literature of human endeavors, to be shared by kindred spirits as well as the curious sorts who have wanted to know, \"What was it like up there?\"In THE GREATEST FLYING STORIES EVER TOLD, editor Lamar Underwood has collected some of the finest writings, both fact and realistic fiction, to lay bare the drama of human beings coping with the skills needed to direct their machines through the vastness of the skies.

        "Authors": "By Kafka, Barbara",
        "Description": "\"Dora, my maternal grandmother,\" writes Barbara Kafka in her new book, \"started the soup tradition that means most to me, which is odd as she was, by all accounts, a bad cook....I hope I am a better cook, and my life has certainly been easier, but I learned from her that a pot of soup is warmth and welcome for family and friends alike.\"  In this stunningly rich and wide-ranging book, Barbara Kafka gives the food we love perhaps best in the world a new vitality. Though the subject is so familiar to us all, her approach is totally original, just as it was in her award-winning Roasting: A Simple Art and Microwave Gourmet. In a wonderfully diverse collection of nearly three hundred recipes from all over the world--some traditional, some newly minted, many so simple they require no cooking at all, each of them very much a part of our spiritual and emotional lives--she offers up a lifetime worth of pleasure:icy soups for steamy days (ceviche soup with ginger) and hot soups for cold days (winter duck soup)rustic potages (great green soup) and elegant consommes (beef madrilene)simple soups to start (Moroccan tomato) and complex soups that make a meal (beef short ribs in a pot)fifteen-minute specials (mussels and tomato soup) and those that simmer all day (pot-au-feu)a magical garlic broth, among other vegetable broths and bases, gives vegetarians hundreds of recipes to enjoy  As always, Barbara's intelligence and talent for innovation have resulted in a vast body of ideas to make your life in the kitchen easy and interesting. Nearly thirty stocks are offered, as well as dozens of ways to use seasonal produce to cook and freeze soup bases for year-round fresh taste. You'll find cooking times for everything from dumplings and piroshki to noodles and pasta, simmering times for every possible cut of meat, and yields and blanching times for dozens of vegetables. There are easy-to-follow charts to answer every cooking question.  And then there's Barbara's \"memory pieces.\" Woven through the recipes, they form a book within a book, one family's personal and culinary history. They're fascinating and warming and enriching on their own. They also remind us why soup is a vital part of our lives. And why Barbara Kafka is a vital part of our cooking experience.",

        "Description": "Every parent wants to know, \"What will he be like when he's in his twenties?\" After decades of observing children grow into young adults, Dr. Mel Levine, nationally known pediatrician and author, addresses the question of why some youngsters make a successful transition into adulthood while others do not.In recent years, says Dr. Levine, we have experienced an epidemic of career unreadiness as too many young people begin what he calls \"the startup years\" unprepared for the challenge of initiating a productive life. Parents and schools often raise children in a highly structured world of overscheduled activities, meeting kids' demands for immediate gratification but leaving them unable to cope on their own. Instead of making a smooth transition into adulthood, many youngsters find themselves trapped in their teenage years, traveling down the wrong career road, unable to function in the world of work. These young people have failed, says Dr. Levine, to properly assess their strengths and weaknesses and have never learned the basics of choosing and advancing through the stages of a career.Dr. Levine urges that schools focus less on college prep (which, he points out, generally means \"college admissions prep\") and instead teach \"life prep,\" equipping adolescents with what they will need to succeed as adults. He identifies these skills as falling within four growth processes, \"the four I's\": inner direction, or self-awareness; interpretation, or understanding the outside world; instrumentation, or the acquisition of mental tools; and interaction, or the ability to relate to other people effectively. It is these abilities that ensure a successful transition into the startup years of early adulthood. Parents, schools, and adolescents themselves can all work together to improve work-life readiness, and Dr. Levine shows how. He even offers advice for young adults who find themselves unable to navigate the world of careers.Insightful, wise, and compassionate, Ready or Not, Here Life Comes is a powerful commentary on our times and a book that can help adolescents and startup adults -- with an assist from parents and educators -- to spring from the starting gate of adulthood.",

        "Title": "The Eye in the Door",
        "Authors": "By Barker, Pat",
        "Description": "The second installment in the Regeneration Trilogy       It is the spring of 1918, and Britain is faced with the possibility of defeat by Germany. A beleaguered government and a vengeful public target two groups as scapegoats: pacifists and homosexuals. Many are jailed, others lead dangerous double lives, the \"the eye in the door\" becomes a symbol of the paranoia that threatens to destroy the very fabric of British society.     Central to this novel are such compelling, richly imagined characters as the brilliant and compassionate Dr. William Rivers; his most famous patient, the poet Siegfried Sassoon; and Lieutenant Billy Prior, who plays a central role as a domestic intelligence agent.  With compelling, realistic dialogue and a keen eye for the social issues that have gone overlooked in mainstream media, The Eye in the Door is a triumph that equals Regeneration and the third novel in the trilogy, the 1995 Booker Prize-winning The Ghost Road, establishing Pat Barker's place in the very forefront of contemporary novelists.",
