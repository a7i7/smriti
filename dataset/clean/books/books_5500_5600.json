        "Authors": "By Lustbader, Eric",
        "Description": "In New York City, a chain of brutal murders begins....In Washington, a plot conceived at the highest levels of American government is at work to bring the economic colossus of Japan to its knees....In Tokyo, a critical power struggle is nearing its final stages for control of the enigmatic Black Blade Society, an ostensibly political cabal whose motives may encompass far more than politics.This is the dynamic setting for Black Blade, the latest triumph for internationally bestselling author Eric Lustbader.As chief of New York Special Homicide Task Force, Wolf Matheson possesses an uncanny ability to track down and capture murderers where all others have failed. Brought in to solve the murder of New York's best-known real estate tycoon, Wolf soon finds himself caught in a frightening spiral of betrayal, lust, and greed, a hall of mirrors where nothing is what it seems and no one can be trusted.Wolf, son of a Wind River Shoshone and a Texas Ranger, soon discovers that murder is the least of the crimes that have been committed: treason, espionage, even, almost unthinkably, the quest for immortality, are all a prelude to an imminent global war.In a whole new arena - larger and more terrifying than any he has been in before - Wolf finds he must battle people possessed of a mind power so lethal it has remained hidden for centuries. To do this he will have to unlock the riddle of his own past; a past he has disowned. Worse, he is forced into an uneasy alliance with the beautiful Japanese woman Chika, who will become either his savior or his murderer.For in Japan, the Oracle has been born, an altogether new form of life that is about to change the balance of world power forever. Each faction of the Black Blade Society - and now Wolf and Chika - is caught in a deadly race against time to find the Oracle before it is put into use. And before their search is over forces they can only guess at will be unleashed to wreak murder, mayhem, and madness on all who join it.Black Blade is bullet-fast reading, a brilliant excursion into adventure and romance, intrigue and sex, providing a feast of insights into the mysteries of the Oriental mind.",

And at his command is the Torch - the tool of ultimate evil that only one man can destroy: Nicholas Linnear.But in order to penetrate Floating City and destroy the demon within, Nicholas must first confront his own inner demons: the Yakuza, the Japanese criminal underworld he despises, and his own past. Until he faces the harrowing truth about himself, about his father, and about the woman he loved as no other - the beautiful and enigmatic Koei - he will be powerless against his enemies. Daughter of a Yakuza chief, or oyabun, and once the source of his deepest happiness, Koei had left him with pain and anguished memories. Only when he encounters her again will Nicholas find the inner strength to carry out the two missions which have now become one: destroy Floating City, and honor his family's debt to the head of the Yakuza, the Kaisho.While Linnear heads into the heart of a vast web of terror, half a world away his long-time friend, ex-NYPD Detective Lew Croaker, is hunting the Kaisho's would-be assassins. His trail leads to Washington and to Vesper Arkham, a woman as fascinating as a train wreck. Beautiful and dangerous, Vesper is part chameleon and all viper. She alone can lead Croaker to a hidden nexus of blood and money...and to the revelation of the nightmare waiting for Nicholas Linnear in Rock's Floating City.",

Before his death, Dr. David Kennessy, a hotshot cancer researcher at DyMar, had been experimenting with a promising but highly dangerous technology: microscopic bio-machines that can cure any disease, heal any wound. In theory this research could be a miracle cure, perhaps even a doorway to immortality. It was also the only way Dr. Kennessy could save his leukemia-stricken son.But when a second corpse turns up, savagely mutilated from within, it's anything but theoretical. Could machines created to cure have learned to kill? Scrambling for answers, Mulder and Scully are opposed at every step by faceless enemies with all the resources of the government - even perhaps of their own agency - at their command. Enemies who will stop at nothing to ensure that the secret of immortality falls in the right hands - their hands.",

        "Authors": "By National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum (COR) and Smith, Curt (EDT)",
        "Description": "For some people baseball means a memory-of a certain dusty ball field on a certain summer day, or the first time they walked into a major league park and saw the perfect emerald playing field. For some, baseball means one heartbreaking or heroic moment. And for others, it means a father, a friend, or an old flame who shared a game for a day or for a lifetime. To create this marvelous book, more than 150 writers, athletes, celebrities, politicians, presidents, and pundits were asked what baseball means to them. The answers came back with richness, wonder, insight, and poetry. A fascinating portrait of baseball's beautiful nuances, What Baseball means to me marks the greatest collection of original essays ever written about the game. Accompanied by more than 200 classic baseball photographs, the voices in this book bring alive the game in all its venues-in the past and present, in wartime and hard times, in Cuba, in Wrigley Field or Yankee Stadium. We meet players in a different light: including Paul Molitor returning a baseball to a trusting boy named Dan Jansen, Derek Jeter as depicted by his dad, the Toledo Mud Hens as seen through the eyes of Christine Brennan, and Pedro Martinez talking about baseball as a way of life in his native Dominican Republic. Most of all, we meet ordinary Americans, like the kids Rudy Giuliani grew up with in Brooklyn, or the man in Philadelphia who transforms himself for every home game from mild-mannered Tom Burgoyne to the Phillie Phanatic. Funny, moving, and each one a diamond in the rough of the American consciousness, the essays in this book are the ultimate baseball conversation. Paying homage to the perfect sport, here is the perfect companion for all our personal baseball journeys.",

Ten years after being diagnosed with cancer, though, misfortune touched him again: He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. As those closest to him -- and many he didn't even know -- gathered to offer their support, Cavuto became attuned at the same time to the stories of others in the business world who had struggled with serious obstacles of their own. Now, in More Than Money, he offers portraits of the many people who have motivated and inspired him -- and whose stories can inspire us all.The men and women Cavuto profiles have faced setbacks of all kinds -- from illness to catastrophic acts of God. But every one of them has gone on to achieve great things in spite of the odds -- reclaiming their own lives, and, just as important, taking time out to better the lives of others along the way. Among Cavuto's subjects:Evelyn Lauder, the cosmetics executive who pioneered the pink ribbon campaign after her own battle with breast cancerJon huntsman, who survived two bouts with cancer to build one of the largest petrochemical companies in the world and found one of the most prominent cancer research centersRichard Branson, the irrepressible (and dyslexic) entrepreneur whose outrageous sense of humor helped him build the Virgin brand into the epitome of coolThroughout, Cavuto weaves their stories and countless others into a compelling, uplifting tribute to the human spirit and the attributes that help us triumph over the obstacles, big and small, that life puts in our way. Moving, sincere, and wise, More Than Money reaffirms that true wealth is measured not by the sprawl of our bank accounts, but by the grace in our hearts.",

Contract with America, by Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker of the House, Dick Armey, the new Majority Leader, and the House Republicans, charts a bold new political strategy for the entire country. The ten-point program, which forms the basis of this book, was announced in late September. It received the signed support of more than 300 GOP canditates. Their pledge: \"If we break this contract, throw us out.\"Contract with America fleshes out the vision and provides the details of the program that swept the GOP to victory. Among the pressing issues addressed in this important book are: balancing the budget, stopping crime, reforming welfare, reinforcing families, enhancing fairness for seniors, strengthening national defense, cutting government regulations, promoting legal reform, considering term limits, and reducing taxes.",

In Real Moments, Barbara De Angelis defines happiness not as an acquisition, but as a skill--the skill of capturing every moment and living it completely.\u00a0\u00a0With insight, wisdom, and vision, she teaches us how to rediscover real moments with our mates and our children, with our work and our play, in sex and intimacy, and real moments with ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0It is an examination of our relationship with the process of living itself, offering inspiration as well as practical tools for creating more of one of the most precious moments of all--moments of true meaning in our lives.",

Zeroing in on Steve Carella, his favorite foil, he bombards the squadroom with directives that seem to describe in detail exactly what he's up to this time - but not quite. What he's planning is his most devilish million-dollar caper to date.In the squadroom, an otherwise slow March night is enlivened by the murder of a graffiti writer under a highway bridge. Over the course of several weeks, more of the city's outlaw artists are killed under mysterious circumstances, and a team run by Detective Parker begins to put the pieces together.Meanwhile, a new criminal activity surfaces: Someone is abandoning helpless elderly men and women at different locations around the city.As if all this weren't enough, racial tensions in the city are at an all-time high. While pressure mounts on various fronts, the city announces a free rap concert in the park, set for a day in the very near future.As the shattering finale of Mischief looms, seemingly unrelated developments intertwine in an ending that sets a new standard even for McBain's most discerning fans.It's been said that \"nobody writes the police procedural as well as Ed McBain\" (San Diego Union). And in his latest tale of the 87th Precinct, Mischief McBain proves his mastery of the genre beyond reasonable doubt.",

        "Authors": "By Godfrey, Joline",
        "Description": "By 1995, almost half of the new business owners in America will be women. Their emerging voices are already starting to challenge our cherished notions about what business is and how it should be run. Not content to give their most productive years only to bump against the \"glass ceiling\" or work in megacorporations that consume every waking hour, women are leaving the Fortune 1000 in droves. They're voting with their feet, closing the door on corporate rigidity, and inventing their own companies in which they can as Godfrey puts it, \"make money, have fun, and do good.\"Herself an entrepreneur, Godfrey talks about the special qualities (the \"New Right Stuff\") that women often bring to a business--qualities rarely recognized or fully appreciated. These include a head, heart, and hands policy, a comfort with connectedness, an appreciation of process and complexity, and an integrated vision of business and ethics. These aren't skills taught in business schools, but are resources lodged deep in the human psyche. They color the voices of women entrepreneurs from around the country who speak out in this book, with stories that resound with hope and energy, daring, and sheer exhilaration. Listen carefully--these are the voices of new leaders who are transforming the business landscape.At a time when corporate wisdom all springs from a male perspective, from the Japanese to The One Minute Manager, from Tom Peters to the Tao, Our Wildest Dreams is genuinely in a class by itself. The exciting possibility of a new way of doing business--not just women's business, but everyone's--is emerging from a never-before-tapped source. And that source, whether we realize it or not, is changing the shape of business in America.",

In Strange Encounters, Botkin does for the natural world what Richard Feynman did for physics and Oliver Sacks for human behavior.  Whether rebuilding an old mill in New Hampshire while ruminating on notions of \"progress,\" researching the most weight-efficient high-protein food for space travel, or working in a radioactive forest on an early Cold War research project, Botkin experiences the kind of adventures that illuminate the complex and ever-changing relationship between human beings and their environment.",

        "Description": "In the depression year of 1938, a boy from Boston's Jewish ghetto graduated summa cum laude from Harvard with an itch to see China and a traveling fellowship to get him there. In China, Teddy White was hired by the young John Hersey to work for Time magazine and quickly established himself as a brilliant correspondent. Hersey was a \"mishkid\" - a child born of missionaries in China - and so was his boss, Henry Luce, the press lord who ran Time and Life magazines. Luce, always wary of friendships, was entranced by White when they met. A love of China and an admiration for its ruler, Chiang Kai-shek, bonded them in a turbulent friendship that lasted for decades.Yet this bond was quickly severed when Teddy turned against Chiang Kai-shek, having discovered and reported the truth about a terrible famine in the north of China that no one - including Chiang - would admit was happening. Soon Teddy could not get his reporting published in Time. It was blocked by a new Luce favorite, the arrogantly polemical Whittaker Chambers, the former Communist who had become the magazine's foreign editor. Before long both Teddy and Hersey - Luce's proteges - had lost their jobs. The turmoil at Luce's magazines mirrored the schisms and confrontations that raged in America in the forties over Communism and McCarthy and the fate of Asia.White exiled himself in Europe during the McCarthy years. On his return to the United States he launched a new career with his Making of the President books, a Pulitzer Prize-winning series that revolutionized the reporting of presidential campaigns. And he and Luce renewed their friendship, which proved stronger than their earlier ideological quarrels.Harry and Teddy is the inside story of America's most successful magazine-publishing empire and the controversial and colorful characters who created it. In addition to White and Luce, the story features a cast that includes not only Whittaker Chambers but Vinegar Joe Stilwell, Chou En-lai, T. S. Matthews, and William F. Buckley, Jr.",

Not slowly over time by abuse or meanness but on a certain day and by ignorance, by plain lack of notice. Though it happened thirty-four years ago, and though I can't say it's haunted my mind that many nights lately, I suspect I can draw it out for you now, clear as this noon. I may need to try....\"  A summer camp in the Blue Ridge mountains, the deceptively tranquil 1950s, a classic semicomic cast and setting (teachers, swarms of rowdy boys, crafts, Indian lore, campfires), the twenty-one-year-old painting teacher and one superbly gifted boy, haunted by a tragic past yet calmly heroic. All advance through splendid weather, natural grandeur and riotous fun toward a startling fate that none will forget.  In his eighth novel, Reynolds Price provides again the kind of voice that won his readers in Kate Vaiden, winner of the 1986 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. A sane adult looks back at his life, finds and gives us the interesting facts, the meanings he thought he learned for good on the threshold of manhood and how they look now, in full maturity.  The Tongues of Angels is intimate, enveloping, relentless and rich. Any veteran of summer camp, boys' or girls', will hear deep echoes, recalling the buried forecasts of youth. Any reader stands to gain throughout.",

        "Title": "Artificial Life: The Quest for a New Creation",
        "Authors": "By Levy, Steven",
        "Description": "This is the startling story of a new science: the science of artificial life. Computer scientists, microbiologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, and evolutionary theorists have succeeded in making creatures that look and act very much like living organisms. They grow, eat, reproduce, mutate, fight with each other, die--and do all this spontaneously, without interference from their human creators.Artificial Life is also the story of a new way of doing science, one arising not out of the laboratory but out of the computer. The power of the computer to depict--and create--emerging systems has transformed our understanding of evolution, the origins of life, and the essential dynamics of natural phenomena, enabling scientists to move beyond life-as-we-know-it to life-as-it-could-be. In the hands of a-life researchers, the computer is not merely a tool but a breeding ground. The artificial organisms that emerge will not only perform our labors but will help us crack nature's toughest codes. Eventually, we may come to grant them the autonomy due other living creatures.From one of our premier chroniclers of the computer age, the author of the classic Hackers, comes a dazzling journey into the heart of artificial life: software that utilizes the force of evolution to solve complex problems, insectlike robots designed to pave a landing area for a manned Mars mission, the use of natural selection to \"train\" molecules to fight the AIDS virus. Steven Levy portrays the scientists and how their dreams and obsessions have led them to a new way of looking at life. By making life, we may finally know what life is.",

But when she becomes a widow unexpectedly, twenty-six years after she retired from Hollywood stardom to become a wife and mother, Amanda finds herself on unfamiliar ground, and is surprised to find herself both befriended by, and attracted to, Jack Watson.  Worse yet, she likes him.  There is a lot more to him than she previously suspected.Amanda's shock at her attraction to Jack is equaled only by her children's.  Then suddenly, a startling announcement stuns both families, as Jack and Amanda are faced with an unexpected gift that neither thought possible, and with a choice that provides them both considerable challenge.

The recent economic depression forced many of the city's laborers out of work. It was a time of extreme gullibility, a time when newspapers began to realize that sensation sold, truth or lies, giving way to a rash of hoaxes.So when two men of supposed high reputation began a rumor that Manhattan was sinking into the harbor because of overdevelopment on its southern tip, everyone listened closely. The men had been sent, they claimed, to save Manhattan from inevitable doom. Their idea: to saw New York in half, drag it out to sea, turn it around and reattach it to the mainland at Kingsbridge. Far fetched? Not at the time when a river was being forged through the mountains to create the Erie Canal. The wonders of engineering made anything possible. And so begins the story of the greatest hoax ever played on the people of New York City.",
