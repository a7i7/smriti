Through the telling of his life story, Jaworski posits that a real leader sets the stage on which \"\"predictable miracles, \"\" seemingly synchronistic in nature, can - and do - occur. He shows that this capacity has more to do with our being - our total orientation of character and consciousness - than with what we do. Leadership, he explains, is about creating - day by day - a domain in which human beings continually deepen their understanding of reality and are able to participate in shaping the future. He describes three basic shifts of mind required if we are to create and discover an unfolding future - shifts in how we see the world, how we understand relationships, and how we make commitments - and offers a new definition of leadership that applies to all types of leaders.",

        "Description": "When Brian McLaren began offering an alternative vision of Christian faith and life in books such asA New Kind of Christian and A Generous Orthodoxy, he ignited a firestorm of praise and condemnation that continues to spread across the religious landscape. To some religious conservatives, McLaren is a dangerous rebel without a doctrinally-correct cause. Some fundamentalist websites have even claimed he's in league with the devil and have consigned him to flames.To others though, Brian is a fresh voice, a welcome antidote to the staleness, superficiality, and negativity of the religious status quo. A wide array of people from Evangelical, Catholic, and Mainline Protestant backgrounds claim that through his books they have begun to rediscover the faith they'd lost or rejected. And around the world, many readers say that he has helped them find-for the first time in their lives-a faith that makes sense and rings true. For many, he articulates the promise of what is being called \"emerging Christianity.\"In The Secret Message of Jesus you'll find what's at the center of Brian's critique of conventional Christianity, and what's at the heart of his expanding vision. In the process, you'll meet a Jesus who may be altogether new to you, a Jesus who is\u2026Not the crusading conqueror of religious broadcasting;Not the religious mascot of partisan religion;Not heaven's ticket-checker, whose words have been commandeered by the church to include and exclude, judge and stigmatize, pacify and domesticate.McLaren invites you to discover afresh the transforming message of Jesus-an open invitation to radical change, an enlightening revelation that exposes sham and ignites hope, an epic story that is good news for everyone, whatever their gender, race, class, politics, or religion.\"Pastor and best-selling author McLaren revisits the gospel material from a fresh-and at times radical-perspective . . . He does an excellent job of capturing Jesus' quiet, revolutionary style.\"--Publishers Weekly (starred review)\"Here McLaren shares his own ferocious journey in pondering the teachings and actions of Jesus. It is McLaren's lack of salesmanship or agenda that creates a refreshing picture of the man from Galilee who changed history.\"--Donald Miller, Author of Blue Like Jazz\"In this critical book, Brian challenges us to ask what it would mean to truly live the message of Jesus today, and thus to risk turning everything upside down.\"--Jim Wallis, Author of God's Politics and editor of Sojourners\"Compelling, crucial and liberating: a book for those who seek to experience the blessed heat of Christianity at its source.\"--Anne Rice, Author of Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt",

        "Description": "Pilgrims in Their Own Land is Martin E. Marty's vivid chronological account of the people and events that carved the spiritual landscape of America.  It is in one sense a study of migration, with each wave of immigrants bringing a set of religious beliefs to a new world.  The narrative unfolds through sharply detailed biographical vignettes&#151;stories of religious \"pathfinders,\" including William Penn, Mary Baker Eddy, Henry David Thoreau, and many other leaders of movements, both marginal and mainstream.  In addition, Marty considers the impact of religion on social issues such as racism, feminism, and utopianism.And engrossing, highly readable, and comprehensive history, Pilgrims in Their Own Land is written with respect, appreciation, and insight into the multitude of religious groups that represent expressions of spirituality in America.",

It means casual entertaining, and it always provides a welcome for warming, nourishing food that pulls people in around the table. With this enticing collection of recipes, \"friendly\" extends to the cook, because one pot means less work and minimal cleanup.Here you'll find Sunday \"Supper in a Bowl,\" which means homestyle and hearty soups, chilis, and gumbos; \"Speedy Sunday Suppers,\" whipped up in 20 minutes or less in a skillet or wok; and roasted meals and casseroles, like Cornbread-Stuffed Pork Chops with Vidalia Onion Sauce, Beer and Chile Braised Beef Brisket, and Tuna, Broccoli, and Brie Casserole, which bake in the oven while you take a rest. There are plenty of chicken and turkey one-pot suppers - Italian Chicken and Sausage with Rice and Seared Peppers, Vegetable Stew with Turkey Meatballs; meaty Sunday suppers - Mediterranean Beef Stew with Olives and Prunes, Shanghai Short Ribs, Chile-Rubbed Lamb with Pinto Beans; and, of course, everyone's favorite, pasta suppers - Pasta and Pepper Frittata, Baked Tortellini with Tomatoes and Cheese, Pasta Paella.On the lighter side, you can choose from \"Seafood Suppers\" - Red Snapper Creole, Baked Shrimp with Feta and Tomatoes, Nicoise-Style Haddock with Couscous - and \"Mostly Meatless Meals,\" which feature vegetables, beans, and grains.",

        "Title": "Flea Market Makeovers: 25 Projects for Fabulous Home Furnishings",
        "Authors": "By Berti, Bj",
        "Description": "The eclectic look is home decor's hottest trend, but flea market shopping has become a national obsession, making it difficult to find real bargains. BJ Berti reveals how easy it is to get the look for less by giving new life to inexpensive castoffs and finding unusual ways to make the most out of ordinary pieces. A flea market veteran, BJ is a pro at reimagining the wobbly end table as a vehicle for vibrant color and seeing beyond a coating of ugly paint or covering of faded fabric. In Flea Market Makeovers, she reveals secrets for spotting diamonds in the rough at local flea markets, neighborhood garage sales, and vintage furniture stores and shows how to gauge the potential of the curbside castoff. Through twenty-five projects and a special section of basic techniques, BJ explains how a little loving care and a touch of elbow grease can transform the most forlorn-looking pieces into charming additions for all rooms of the home. Step-by-step instructions make it easy to follow her philosophy of restore, revive, and reuse. Why overlook a piece just because it has loose joints or a shaky leg? Minor fixes are easy to accomplish with a little craft know-how, and sometimes just a rigorous cleaning is all that's needed to unveil a prize find. BJ carefully describes how to strip away layers of paint, smooth nicks and dents, and replace old stuffing and fabric. She also illustrates how simple it is to revive a piece by adding a painted pattern, some beveled mirror pieces, or a carved wooden molding. For example, a simple folding card table looks entirely different after BJ replaces its dull floral tabletop with new painted canvas. Finally, BJ demonstrates how to successfully reuse pieces with unexpected placement. For example, a bookcase with fresh detailing stands out as smart storage for a dining room, and a panel from an old upright piano makes waves as a headboard over a bed. With projects that range from a new lamp to brighten a corner of a living room to a mirrored panel for sectioning off a study, Flea Market Makeovers balances the best of crafting with extremely chic results for every room of the home. Flea Market Makeovers makes it easy to spot the hidden gems with the acumen of a pro.",

Along the way he has earned millions of admirers\u2014and more than his share of enemies\u2014by advancing controversial, often counterintuitive arguments, including: \u2022 Liberals love losing because it makes them feel virtuous\u2022 America isn\u2019t normal\u2014it\u2019s bizarrely blessed\u2022 Hollywood has lost touch with America\u2014and punishes people who point that out\u2022 Conservatives are both happier and nicer than liberals\u2022 Talk radio is a source of hope, not hatred\u2022 Business isn\u2019t exploitative\u2014it\u2019s heroic \u2022 There is no such thing as \u201cplanned parenthood\u201d\u2022 A more Christian America is good for the Jews\u2022 Do-it-yourself conservatism provides the only cure for save-the-world liberalismIn the candid, electrifying Right Turns, Medved chronicles the adventures that taught him these and many other lessons\u2014the startling events that propelled him from Vietnam protest leader to optimistic promoter of American patriotism, from secularism to religion, from adventurous single guy to doting husband and father. In the process he skewers leftist orthodoxy, revealing why the Right is right and why his former colleagues on the Left remain hopelessly wrong on every cultural, political, and social issue. Medved enters today\u2019s ideological fray armed with experience as, among many other things, a campaign aide for radical Democrats, a minority recruiter for police departments, a Hollywood screenwriter, a Bobby Kennedy volunteer, a teacher at religious schools, a world-champion hitchhiker, an expert on bad movies, and a veteran TV host on PBS and a British network\u2014who declines to own a TV himself. Medved relishes the contradictions behind the high-profile controversies in which he\u2019s played a leading role\u2014as a prominent movie reviewer who attacked the film industry in a bestselling book, as an observant Jew whose radio show is a favorite with evangelical Christians, as a writer once designated the \u201cBard of the Baby Boomers\u201d who now expresses contempt for his generation\u2019s arrogant indulgence, and as a fearless battler who has sought advice from both Rush Limbaugh and Hillary Clinton and has given advice to both Mel Gibson and Barbra Streisand.Right Turns displays the slashing argument and disarming wit that have made Medved\u2019s radio program America\u2019s number one show on politics and pop culture.",

Though Mr. Irving's cool eye spares none of his foursome, he writes with genuine compassion for the sexual tests and illusions they perpetrate on each other; but the sexual intrigue between them demonstrates how even the kind can be ungenerous, and even the well-intentioned, destructive.\"One of the most remarkable things about John Irving's first three novels, viewed from the vantage of The World According to Garp, is that they can be read as one extended fictional enterprise. . . . The 158-Pound Marriage is as lean and concentrated as a mine shaft.\" --Terrence Des Pres",
