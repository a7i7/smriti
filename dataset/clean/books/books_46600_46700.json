Indeed, once maligned by Charles Dickens as simply \"spacious avenues that begin in nothing and lead nowhere; streets a mile long that only want houses, roads, and inhabitants; public buildings that need but a public to be complete, \" Washington, D.C. today is a powerful symbol not only of our nation but of democracy.Spanning the Potomac in majestic fashion, the city fans out gracefully, offering a multitude of pleasures to the more than twenty million tourists who visit annually.  From official Washington (the imposing Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, the White House, the Capitol, the souring obelisk of the Washington Monument) to its lush public parks and gardens; from Union Station to Ford's Theater; the Willard Hotel to the Library of Congress to the fabled Belgian Embassy; the charm of its celebrated Cherry Blossom Festival to the somber beauty of the Vietnam Wall; from the delightful Easter egg roll to the profoundly moving Holocaust Museum\u2014Washington D.C., A Photographic Tour manages to convey all the grandeur of the nation's capital while reminding us that this splendor belongs, of course, to all who prize democracy.",

        "Description": "The Smithsonian Institution has been America's museum since 1846. What do its vast collections -- from the ruby slippers to a piece of Plymouth Rock, first ladies' gowns to patchwork quilts, a Model T Ford to a customized Ford LTD low rider -- tell Americans about themselves? In this lavishly illustrated guide to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, Steven Lubar and Kathleen M. Kendrick tell the stories behind more than 250 of the museum's treasures, many of them never before photographed for publication. These stories not only reveal what America as a nation has decided to save and why but also speak to changing visions of national identity.As the authors demonstrate, views of history change over time, methods of historical investigation evolve and improve, and America's understanding of the past matures. Shifts in focus and attitude lie at the hearth ofLegacies, which is organized around four concepts of what a national museum of history can be: a treasure house, a shrine to the famous, a palace of progress, and a mirror of the nation. Thus, the museum collects cherished or precious objects, houses celebrity memorabilia, documents technological advances, and reflects visitors' own lives. Taking examples from science and technology, politics, decorative arts, military history, ethnic heritage, popular culture and everyday life, the authors provide historical context for the work of the Smithsonian and shed new light on what is important, and who is included, in American history. Throughout its history, Lubar and Kendrick conclude, the museum has played a vital role in both shaping and reflecting America's sense of itself as a nation.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Authors": "By Davis, Sue",
        "Description": "This analysis of the decision making of William H. Rehnquist from the beginning of his tenure as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court in 1971 until he was nominated to be Chief Justice in 1986 presents a refreshing new perspective on the Burger Court's most conservative member. The common assessment of Rehnquist's career on the Supreme Court is that he has tried to put his own political agenda into effect--deciding as he wishes and justifying it later. Davis disputes that view through careful, insightful analysis of his opinions, his votes, and his public speeches. She argues that Rehnquist does, indeed, have a judicial philosophy--one that has legal positivism at its core. By examining the interaction between the facets of that judicial philosophy and Rehnquist's particular ordering of values, Davis reveals the coherence of his decision making.The author finds that Rehnquist's hierarchy of values gives paramount importance to state autonomy, or the \"new federalism.\" He sees the protection of private property as secondary to the significance of federalism, followed, finally, by the protection of individual rights.Originally published in 1989.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.",

As a young man he comes into his own during World War II, where he falls for the magic of flight and thrives on the danger of battle. He has become a man of undeniable magnetism, brash and vigorously optimistic. But when the war is over and he is back on the ground - in cold-war America - Harrison loses his bearings and catapults out of orbit. As his notions of the world begin to fail him and the people he claims to love fail to understand him, he sabotages his career, drinks to excess, and drives his family into emotional bedlam. But the story is not Harrison's alone.In Cynthia Shearer's arresting vision, the turbulence Harrison creates is woven into a canvas that captures the seismic shifts of history, of change, of forces that we try to name to protect ourselves from their randomness. In the wake of Harrison's terrifying-and-terrified behavior, we watch his children search for hope in the emotional wreckage and find some understanding of solace, compassion, and love.",

        "Description": "\"Everyone who is seriously interested in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe--a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.\" --Albert Einstein\"I am fascinated by some strange developments going on in astronomy,... The astronomical evidence leads to a biblical view of the origin of the world.\" --Robert Jastrow, director NASA's Goddard Institute for Space StudiesHave you ever looked up into the heavens at night--or felt a tiny baby grip your finger--and been filled with wonder?The world is filled with wonder everywhere we look. Who made all of this? Did it just happen? Or is there really a God who, as the Bible says, \"created the heaven and the earth\"?Can anyone really deny it? If you say there is no God, then all the wonders around you are just an accident. The billions of stars in the sky just happened to make themselves and generate their own power to keep on course. The land just happens to have topsoil without which nothing could grow. The air we breathe--only 50 miles deep and exactly the right composition to support life--is just another accident in the laws of physics.Can you believe these things just happened? Isn't it more reasonable to believe that a supreme mind is behind all of this and everything that exists? Take the deposits of coal, zinc, gold and uranium. Did they get there by accident? And what prevents lakes from freezing solid, all the way down to the bottom, making it impossible for fish to survive?Why does the earth spin at a given speed without slowing up so that we have day and night? Who tilts it so that we get seasons? No one really knows the why and how of the magnetic pulls. Or think of the sun stoking a fire just warm enough to sustain us on earth, but not hot enough to fry us or cold enough to freeze us. Who keeps the fire constant?And what about the human body--an intricate combination of bones, muscles, nerves and blood vessels. The human brain has far greater capacity than any computer we have ever imagined. The kidneys contain approximately 280 miles of tiny tubes, and in the course of a day filter 185 quarts of water from the blood.And then there is the heart, an unbelievably rugged organ: a four-chamber, four-valve pump that handles 5,000 gallons of blood a day--almost enough to fill a railroad tank car. It supplies a circulatory system with 12,000 miles of vessels and, in the course of a lifetime, beats two and one half billion times. All the blood in your body is pumped through your heart every minute while your heart beats 100,800 times a day.Before you say, \"There is no God,\" think of these marvels.All of creation gives evidence that there is a Creator. But why do people still doubt God's existence? How can we know that He really does exist and He is interested in us?The Bible says that we are by nature \"dead in trespasses\" and that we are \"alienated from the life of God\" (Ephesians 2:1; 4:18). Just as a body without physical life is declared physically dead, so anyone who is separated from God is described in the Bible as spiritually dead. And as long as we remain spiritually dead we can never really know God. We all need a new life. We need to be cleansed from sin and its penalty and restored to fellowship with God. This is what Jesus Christ meant when he said we \"must be born again\" (John 3:7).God sent Jesus Christ, His only Son, so that we might have new, everlasting life. The Bible tells us, \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16).By His death and resurrection Jesus paid for our salvation. He broke the power of sin and death, making it possible for us to have everlasting life.Jesus said, \"I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly\" (John 10:10). Receiving the new life that Jesus offers is what being born again means. And this new everlasting life will be yours if you will acknowledge you are a sinner and receive Him as your Savior and Lord.\"This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life\" (1 John 5:11-12).Is Jesus Christ your Savior? Have you ever been born again? You can be right now by praying and asking Christ to come into your life.",

Over endless hours and bottles of whiskey consumed in a mysterious caf\u00e9 called L\u2019Entre Deux Mondes, he recounts, in counterpoint to his doubts, the one story he has never told before, perhaps the only important one he will ever tell.

All our lives we had been taught the virtues of behaving, and now we were discovering the importance of misbehaving. Too much fear had tainted our days. Too many afternoons had passed in silence, listening to a fanatic\u2019s diatribes. We were rebelling because we were not evil, we had not sinned, and we knew nothing of the apocalypse. . . . This was 1979, the year that showed us we could make our own destinies. We were rebelling because rebelling was all we could do to quell the rage in our teenage veins. Together as girls we found the courage we had been told was not in us.\u201dIn Journey from the Land of No Roya Hakakian recalls her childhood and adolescence in prerevolutionary Iran with candor and verve. The result is a beautifully written coming-of-age story about one deeply intelligent and perceptive girl\u2019s attempt to \u00ef\u00ac?nd an authentic voice of her own at a time of cultural closing and repression. Remarkably, she manages to re-create a time and place dominated by religious fanaticism, violence, and fear with an open heart and often with great humor.Hakakian was twelve years old in 1979 when the revolution swept through Tehran. The daughter of an esteemed poet, she grew up in a household that hummed with intellectual life. Family gatherings were punctuated by witty, satirical exchanges and spontaneous recitations of poetry. But the Hakakians were also part of the very small Jewish population in Iran who witnessed the iron fist of the Islamic fundamentalists increasingly tightening its grip. It is with the innocent confusion of youth that Roya describes her discovery of a swastika\u2014\u201ca plus sign gone awry, a dark reptile with four hungry claws\u201d\u2014painted on the wall near her home. As a schoolgirl she watched as friends accused of reading blasphemous books were escorted from class by Islamic Society guards, never to return. Only much later did Roya learn that she was spared a similar fate because her teacher admired her writing.Hakakian relates in the most poignant, and at times painful, ways what life was like for women after the country fell into the hands of Islamic fundamentalists who had declared an insidious war against them, but we see it all through the eyes of a strong, youthful optimist who somehow came up in the world believing that she was different, knowing she was special. At her loneliest, Roya discovers the consolations of writing while sitting on the rooftop of her house late at night. There, \u201cpen in hand, I led my own chorus of words, with a melody of my own making.\u201d And she discovers the craft that would ultimately enable her to find her own voice and become her own person.A wonderfully evocative story, Journey from the Land of No reveals an Iran most readers have not encountered and marks the debut of a stunning new talent.",

        "Description": "Marlene hosts a dinner party in a London restaurant to celebrate her promotion to managing director of 'Top Girls' employment agency. Her guests are five women from the past: Isabella Bird (1831- 1904) - the adventurous traveller; Lady Nijo (b1258) - the mediaeval courtesan who became a Buddhist nun and travelled on foot through Japan; Dull Gret, who as Dulle Griet in a Bruegel painting, led a crowd of women on a charge through hell; Pope Joan - the transvestite early female pope and last but not least Patient Griselda, an obedient wife out of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. As the evening continues we are involved with the stories of all five women and the impending crisis in Marlene's own life. A classic of contemporary theatre, Churchill's play is seen as a landmark for a new generation of playwrights. It was premiered by the Royal Court in 1982.\"Top Girls has a combination of directness and complexity which keeps you both emotionally and intellectually alert. You can smell life, and at the same time feel locked in an argument with an agile and passionate mind.\" (John Peter, Sunday Times)",

        "Description": "Set in Italy during the dramatic finale of World War II, this new novel is the first in seven years by the bestselling author of The Sparrow and Children of God.It is September 8, 1943, and fourteen-year-old Claudette Blum is learning Italian with a suitcase in her hand. She and her father are among the thousands of Jewish refugees scrambling over the Alps toward Italy, where they hope to be safe at last, now that the Italians have broken with Germany and made a separate peace with the Allies. The Blums will soon discover that Italy is anything but peaceful, as it becomes overnight an open battleground among the Nazis, the Allies, resistance fighters, Jews in hiding, and ordinary Italian civilians trying to survive.Mary Doria Russell sets her first historical novel against this dramatic background, tracing the lives of a handful of fascinating characters. Through them, she tells the little-known but true story of the network of Italian citizens who saved the lives of forty-three thousand Jews during the war\u2019s final phase. The result of five years of meticulous research, A Thread of Grace  is an ambitious, engrossing novel of ideas, history, and marvelous characters that will please Russell\u2019s many fans and earn her even more.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Description": "\"America suffers from a sort of intermittent fever. . . . Every fourth year there come terrible shakings, passing into the hot fit of the presidential election; then follows what physicians call 'the interval'; then the fit again.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--James Bryce,The American Commonwealth, 1888 Once every four years, Americans enter into a months-long national spectacle, one with bitter battles, high drama, often hilarious blunders, and, ultimately, a victor to whom we entrust the leadership of our country. It is a process integral to the American ideals of freedom and democracy, and each election reveals a tremendous amount about where and who we are as a nation. In Hats in the Ring, Evan Cornog and Richard Whelan have created a hugely entertaining, splendidly illustrated history of every election from Washington's to Clinton's. For the first time, all the vibrancy, fanfare, and zaniness of American presidential campaigns come to life in one dazzling volume. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Award-winning author Evan Cornog provides a lively narrative of the people, parties, and politics of more than two hundred years of history. Every engaging, pithy chapter is packed with fascinating information about the candidates and their campaigns. From the Wide Awakes to the Know-Nothings, fervent supporters and their candidates, including some of the greatest figures in American history--Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, FDR--progress vividly through these pages.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The visual richness of the campaigns is brought to life with more than two hundred color and black-and-white illustrations, including portraits, leaflets, cartoons, photographs, posters, campaign buttons, and other memorabilia, all selected by the eminent cultural historian Richard Whelan. He has delved deep into public and private collections to find the defining images, both classic and unfamiliar, of each election. There are portraits of heroic men beside those of also-rans, moments of triumph and shame captured by the camera, hilarious cartoons and works of art created by many of the greatest American artists, from Gilbert Stuart to Ben Shahn, Thomas Nast to Herblock.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The chapter for each election provides a wonderful snapshot of United States history and culture. Short sidebars on important aspects of the development of American politics (including constitutional changes, third parties, and suffrage for blacks and women) complement the narrative throughout. There are also clear, concise charts that offer at-a-glance information on every election, including major-party candidates and electoral tallies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presidential campaigns have provided some of the most stirring moments, poignant images, and idiosyncratic characters in our nation's annals. No matter what your political leanings are, Hats in the Ring delivers a sparkling and invaluable tour though some of the greatest episodes in American history.",
