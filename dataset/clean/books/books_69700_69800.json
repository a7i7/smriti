These are just some of the questions answered in this fascinating and informative picture book on feline behavior. Through the inventive narrative, young readers examine the instincts of the common house cat. The text works on two levels: it describes a day in the life of a pet cat named Molly, and then explains the scientific basis for all of her actions. Some of the most ordinary cat antics, like pouncing on a toy or scratching against an object, are deeply rooted in the behavior of wild ancestors. Susan Bonners expertly explains why our beloved pets act the curious way they do.",

The three-hundred-fifty-year-old rustico sat perched on a hill in the verdant Spoleto valley amid an olive grove and fruit trees of every kind. For the Tuckers, it was literally love at first sight, and the couple purchased the house without testing the water pressure or checking for signs of termites. Shedding the vestiges of their American life, Michael and Jill endeavored to learn the language, understand the nuances of Italian culture, and build a home in this new chapter of their lives. Both a celebration of a good marriage and a careful study of the nature of home,  Living in a Foreign Language  is a gorgeous, organic travelogue written with an epicurean\u2019s delight in detail and a gourmand\u2019s appreciation for all things fine.",

        "Description": "Since the now ubiquitous LIVESTRONG\u2122 wristbands became available in May 2004, the Lance Armstrong Foundation has raised more than $50 million for cancer survivorship programs, and the signature phrase has become a battle cry for those who fight the disease every day.Now, the Lance Armstrong Foundation has compiled, from hours of videotaped interviews, poignant and dramatic personal accounts from cancer survivors. Covering a wide range of subjects, from grief to spousal relationships, employment discrimination to coping with medical bills, infertility to fear of recurrence, survivors share their experiences and speak candidly about how cancer has impacted their lives. For twenty-four-year-old Amy it\u2019s how her illness changed her relationship with her parents. Mike, a male survivor of breast cancer, talks about gender stereotypes and genetic testing. And Eric, the father of a five-year-old survivor of a brain tumor, recalls how friends and strangers helped his family with financial issues and how the experience brought him and his wife closer together.While heartbreaking at times, these powerfully honest stories are ultimately uplifting and extremely reassuring to patients and their families. They offer the wisdom and hope that only survivors can give. LiveStrong is a remarkable testament to the resilience of the human spirit.From the introduction by Lance Armstrong:My work with the LAF shows me daily that sharing our stories and learning from one another\u2019s experiences helps us cancer survivors continue to survive.  Some people think the cancer experience is only about the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, as if after the disease goes into remission, it no longer exists.  But survivorship goes beyond remission.  Survivorship is an evolution.",

        "Title": "The Road to Disunion, Volume II: Secessionists Triumphant 1854-1861",
        "Authors": "By Freehling, William W.",
        "Description": "Here is history in the grand manner, a powerful narrative peopled with dozens of memorable portraits, telling this important story with skill and relish. Freehling highlights all the key moments on the road to war, including the violence in Bleeding Kansas, Preston Brooks's beating of Charles Sumner in the Senate chambers, the Dred Scott Decision, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, and much more. As Freehling shows, the election of Abraham Lincoln sparked a political crisis, but at first most Southerners took a cautious approach, willing to wait and see what Lincoln would do--especially, whether he would take any antagonistic measures against the South. But at this moment, the extreme fringe in the South took charge, first in South Carolina and Mississippi, but then throughout the lower South, sounding the drum roll for secession. Indeed, The Road to Disunion is the first book to fully document how this decided minority of Southern hotspurs took hold of the secessionist issue and, aided by a series of fortuitous events, drove the South out of the Union. Freehling provides compelling profiles of the leaders of this movement--many of them members of the South Carolina elite. Throughout the narrative, he evokes a world of fascinating characters and places as he captures the drama of one of America's most important--and least understood--stories. The long-awaited sequel to the award-winning Secessionists at Bay, which was hailed as \"the most important history of the Old South ever published,\" this volume concludes a major contribution to our understanding of the Civil War. A compelling, vivid portrait of the final years of the antebellum South, The Road to Disunion will stand as an important history of its subject. \"This sure-to-be-lasting work--studded with pen portraits and consistently astute in its appraisal of the subtle cultural and geographic variations in the region--adds crucial layers to scholarship on the origins of America's bloodiest conflict.\"--The Atlantic Monthly\"Splendid, painstaking account...and so a work of history reaches into the past to illuminate the present. It is light we need, and we owe Freehling a debt for shedding it.\"--Washington Post\"A masterful, dramatic, breathtakingly detailed narrative.\"--The Baltimore Sun",

Yet he is also strangely drawn to Sophie, whose courage and compassion sustain them all, from her family to the quixotic, tormented physician who silently adores her. And even as Sophie keeps a tender secret of her own, she works toward realizing yet another dream: the miracle of an original repeat-flowering crimson rose -- a hopeful symbol of an unblighted future.",

Whether he was in his White House residence study or aboard Air Force One, each night Reagan wrote about the events of his day, which often included his relationships with other world leaders Mikhail Gorbachev, Pope John Paul 11, Mohammar alQaddafi, and Margaret Thatcher, among others, and the unforgettable moments that defined the era-from his first inauguration to the end of the Cold War, the Iran hostage crisis to John Hinckley Jr.'s assassination attempt.The Reagan Diaries reveals more than just Reagan's political experiences: many entries are concerned with the president's private thoughts and feelings-his love and devotion for Nancy Reagan and their family, his belief in God and the power of prayer. Seldom before has the American public been given access to the unfiltered experiences ancl opinions of a president in his own words, from Reagan's description of near-drowning at the home of Hollywood friend Claudette Colbert to his determination to fight Fidel Castro at every turn and keep the Caribbean Sea from becoming a \"Red Lake.\"",

        "Title": "Retribution: The Battle for Japan, 1944-45",
        "Authors": "By Hastings, Max",
        "Description": "Hailed in Britain as \u201cSpectacular . . . Searingly powerful\u201d (Andrew Roberts, The Sunday Telegraph), a riveting, impeccably informed chronicle of the final year of the Pacific war. In his critically acclaimed Armageddon, Hastings detailed the last twelve months of the struggle for Germany. Here, in what can be considered a companion volume, he covers the horrific story of the war against Japan.By the summer of 1944 it was clear that Japan\u2019s defeat was inevitable, but how the drive to victory would be achieved remained to be seen. The ensuing drama\u2014that ended in Japan\u2019s utter devastation\u2014was acted out across the vast stage of Asia, with massive clashes of naval and air forces, fighting through jungles, and barbarities by an apparently incomprehensible foe. In recounting the saga of this time and place, Max Hastings gives us incisive portraits of the theater\u2019s key figures\u2014MacArthur, Nimitz, Mountbatten, Chiang Kai-shek, Mao, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. But he is equally adept in his portrayals of the ordinary soldiers and sailors\u2014American, British, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese\u2014caught in some of the war\u2019s bloodiest campaigns.With unprecedented insight, Hastings discusses Japan\u2019s war against China, now all but forgotten in the West, MacArthur\u2019s follies in the Philippines, the Marines at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and the Soviet blitzkrieg in Manchuria. He analyzes the decision-making process that led to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\u2014which, he convincingly argues, ultimately saved lives. Finally, he delves into the Japanese wartime mind-set, which caused an otherwise civilized society to carry out atrocities that haunt the nation to this day.Retribution is a brilliant telling of an epic conflict from a master military historian at the height of his powers.",

        "Authors": "By Aria, Barbara and Moore, Steve (PHT)",
        "Description": "A Manhattan townhouse in which barn walls were reassembled to satisfy the resident's rustic yearnings ... an impeccably appointed country house where moss - quite literally - grows between the floorboards ... a New England cottage in which the furniture sprouts twigs, bark, and even pine cones.... All are examples of homes designed with nature in mind. Gone is the cold steel of postmodernism, the overdone period interior, the inflexible decorating scheme. Here instead is a celebration of interiors suffused with life and growth, with the elements and the seasons.Outside Inside is the first compendium of decorating ideas to recognize nature's designs as valid models for domestic decor. Organized according to the five senses, it combines spectacular photography with detailed advice on how to integrate natural elements into preexisting interiors. Arrangements of winter branches delight the eye; tatami mats underfoot pamper the sense of touch; a fountain fills a city apartment with the sound of running water; imaginative table settings and recipes tantalize the taste buds.For anyone who pines for the simple, barefoot delights of a summer childhood, wishes that the spirit of a weekend retreat could carry over into every day of the week, or simply requires relief from the fast pace of contemporary living, Outside Inside is an inspired yet practical guide to making changes for the better.",

It is capable of endless subtleties; fragile or strong, it can be transparent as ice, opaque as marble, in love with light as a diamond.Now the secrets of using this most challenging color is explored and shared by the editors of Victoria magazine in At Home with White. More than 150 beautiful photographs feature the many decorating styles created or enhanced by the color of white - richly traditional, clean-lined contemporary, rustic country, breezy tropical, lushly romantic. Victoria takes us on an informative tour of the exquisite fabrics that bring these styles to life, from hardworking cottons to sophisticated linens to precious laces. We are invited into the wonderful, magical world of summer, a season that seems as if it were created expressly for white, and into the private places in our homes made intimate and fresh with white - bedroom, bathroom, dressing room. The white gardens, porches, and terraces that serve as refuges in our lives are explored, as is the long-standing friendship between white and blue. Throughout the book are profiles of homeowners who have spun some magic of their own with this most intriguing color.",

        "Title": "The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008",
        "Authors": "By Woodward, Bob",
        "Description": "As violence in Iraq reaches unnerving levels in 2006, a second front in the war rages at the highest levels of the Bush administration. In his fourth book on President George W. Bush, Bob Woodward takes readers deep inside the tensions, secret debates, unofficial backchannels, distrust and determination within the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department, the intelligence agencies and the U.S. military headquarters in Iraq. With unparalleled intimacy and detail, this gripping account of a president at war describes a period of distress and uncertainty within the U.S. government from 2006 through mid-2008.   The White House launches a secret strategy review that excludes the military. General George Casey, the commander in Iraq, believes that President Bush does not understand the war and eventually concludes he has lost the president's confidence. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also conduct a secret strategy review that goes nowhere. On the verge of revolt, they worry that the military will be blamed for a failure in Iraq.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice strongly opposes a surge of additional U.S. forces and confronts the president, who replies that her suggestions would lead to failure. The president keeps his decision to fire Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld from Vice President Dick Cheney until two days before he announces it. A retired Army general uses his high-level contacts to shape decisions about the war, as Bush and Cheney use him to deliver sensitive messages outside the chain of command. For months, the administration's strategy reviews continue in secret, with no deadline and no hurry, in part because public disclosure would harm Republicans in the November 2006 elections. National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley tells Rice, \"We've got to do it under the radar screen because the electoral season is so hot.\"The War Within provides an exhaustive account of the struggles of General David Petraeus, who takes over in Iraq during one of the bleakest and most violent periods of the war. It reveals how breakthroughs in military operations and surveillance account for much of the progress as violence in Iraq plummets in the middle of 2007.Woodward interviewed key players, obtained dozens of never-before-published documents, and had nearly three hours of exclusive interviews with President Bush. The result is a stunning, firsthand history of the years from mid-2006, when the White House realizes the Iraq strategy is not working, through the decision to surge another 30,000 U.S. troops in 2007, and into mid-2008, when the war becomes a fault line in the presidential election.The War Within addresses head-on questions of leadership, not just in war but in how we are governed and the dangers of unwarranted secrecy.",

        "Title": "From Geography to Affinity: How Congregations Can Learn From One Another",
        "Authors": "By Schaller, Lyle E.",
        "Description": "Changes in denominational life in North America have left congregations with two difficult choices. On one hand, they can choose to act as though their ministries and programs can still best be established by national denominational offices. On the other hand, they can choose to act as though their denominational identity is completely irrelevant to their mission. Underlying these difficult choices, writes Lyle E. Schaller, is the tremendous flux in the relationship between national denominations and their member congregations over the last forty years. The fact that relatively few visitors choose to affiliate with a congregation on the basis of denominational identity leads some to conclude (incorrectly) that the interdependence and cooperation between congregations of similar heritage and background is unimportant. At the same time, others conclude (also incorrectly) that there is nothing wrong with current denominational structures and that congregations need simply to align themselves with their denomination's directions more thoroughly. To these bad choices, Schaller proposes an alternative. He observes that many congregations already seek to extend their mission and make their ministries more effective by participating in affinity networks--groups of congregations that share particular goals and visions. Schaller suggests the establishment of such networks within, rather than outside of, denominations. He argues that they should be established on the judicatory level. Rather than making state or regional boundaries the organizing principle by which congregations within a denomination align themselves, why not form judicatories around a particular sense of mission, or distinctive theological stands? Schaller concludes that allowing and encouraging the formation of such affinity networks will recognize the differences between congregations within a denominations as the strength it truly is, and will, foster a greater unity of purpose between the denomination's churches.",

        "Title": "Coal River",
        "Authors": "By Shnayerson, Michael",
        "Description": "One of America's most dramatic environmental battles is unfolding in southern West Virginia. Coal companies are blasting the mountains, decapitating them for coal. The forested ridge tops and valley streams of Appalachia - one of the country's natural treasures - are being destroyed, along with towns and communities. An entire culture is disappearing, and to this day, most Americans have no idea it's happening.Michael Shnayerson first traveled to the coalfields four years ago, on assignment for Vanity Fair. There he met an inspiring young lawyer named Joe Lovett who was fighting mountaintop removal in court with a series of brilliant and daring lawsuits. He also met a resolute, hard-as-shale coal miner's daughter named Judy Bonds, whose grassroots group, Coal River Mountain Watch, was speaking out in a region where talking truth to power was both brave and dangerous. The two had joined forces to take on Massey Energy, the largest and most aggressive of the coal companies, and its swaggering, notorious chairman, Don Blankenship. The stage was set for an epic American struggle between fearless individuals and a greedy corporate giant; between a cherished way of life and the industry that threatened to destroy it forever.Coal River is Shnayerson's account of this dramatic struggle. From country hollows to federal courtrooms, from rural West Virginia to the corridors of power in Washington D.C., Shnayerson gives us a novelistic and compelling portrait of the people who risked their reputations and livelihoods in the fight against King Coal.",

Behind the palace's veil of prosperity, bitter rivalries and jealousy flourished among the Boy King's most trusted advisors, and after only nine years, King Tut suddenly perished, his name purged from Egyptian history. To this day, his death remains shrouded in controversy. The keys to an unsolved mysteryEnchanted by the ruler's tragic story and hoping to unlock the answers to the 3,000 year-old mystery, Howard Carter made it his life's mission to uncover the pharaoh's hidden tomb. He began his search in 1907, but encountered countless setbacks and dead-ends before he finally, uncovered the long-lost crypt. The clues point to murderNow, in The Murder of King Tut, James Patterson and Martin Dugard dig through stacks of evidence--X-rays, Carter's files, forensic clues, and stories told through the ages--to arrive at their own account of King Tut's life and death. The result is an exhilarating true crime tale of intrigue, passion, and betrayal that casts fresh light on the oldest mystery of all.",

These are the catchphrases used to describe that elusive and mysterious generation of 46 million Americans born between 1965 and 1980. More than that, these are our children, our neighbors, our friends, and fellow employees.  Tim Celek and Deiter Zander have learned through years of experience that to win this generation of young people, you have to fight harder for credibility, and you have to love harder to overcome their pasts. But they have also found that reaching them is well worth the effort. Inside the Soul of a New Generation offers a fascinating, inside look at the unique forces that shape this misunderstood generation and shows how pastors, parents, and Baby Boomers of every stripe can minister to their spiritual needs. From practical ways to reach out to Busters and build powerful, Buster-friendly churches, to creating a vital community and empowering Busters for leadership, Celek and Zander show that this generation is not only reachable, but has the potential to effect positive changes both in the church and in the world.",

        "Authors": "By Ford, Richard",
        "Description": "Richard Ford's Independence Day--his sequel to The Sportswriter, and an international bestseller--is the only novel ever to have received both the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award. Now, with Women With Men, he reaffirms his mastery of shorter fiction with his first collection since the widely acclaimed Rock Springs, published a decade ago.The landscape of Women with Men ranges from the northern plains of Montana to the streets of Paris and the suburbs of Chicago, where Mr. Ford's various characters experience the consolations and complications that prevail in matters of passion, romance and love. A seventeen-year-old boy starting adulthood in the shadow of his parents' estrangement, a survivor of three marriages now struggling with cancer, an ostensibly devoted salesman in early middle age, an aspiring writer, a woman scandalously betrayed by her husband--they each of them contend with the vast distances that exist between those who are closest together. Whether alone, long married or newly met, they confront the obscure difference between privacy and intimacy, the fine distinction of pleasing another as opposed to oneself, and a need for reliance that is tempered by fearful vulnerability.In three long stories, Richard Ford captures men and women at this complex and essential moment of truth--in the course of everyday life, or during a bleak Thanksgiving journey, seismic arguments, Christmas abroad, the sudden disappearance of a child, even a barroom shooting. And with peerless emotional nuance and authority he once again demonstrates, as Elizabeth Hardwick has written, \"a talent as strong and varied as American fiction has to offer.\"",
