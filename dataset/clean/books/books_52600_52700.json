        "Description": "The tragic true story of Japan's Crown Princess-with a new afterword by the author. It's the fantasy of many young women: marry a handsome prince, move into a luxurious palace, and live happily ever after. But that's not how it turned out for Masako Owada. Ben Hills's fascinating portrait of Princess Masako and the Chrysanthemum Throne draws on research in Tokyo and rural Japan, at Oxford and Harvard, and from more than sixty interviews with Japanese, American, British, and Australian sources-many of whom have never spoken publicly before-shedding light on the royal family's darkest secrets, secrets that can never be openly discussed in Japan because of the reverence in which the emperor and his family are held. But most of all, this is a story about a love affair that went tragically wrong. The paperback edition will contain a new afterword by the author, discussing the impact this book had in Japan, where it was banned.",

        "Description": "To all Americans, Mickey Mantle epitomizes the Golden Age of American sport: He is the quintessential hero of a time when much was right with the world, and nothing was ever wrong with the New York Yankees. In All My Octobers, Mickey recounts his career as an athletic phenomenon in the greatest dynasty baseball has ever seen: the days when he and his Yankee teammates made it to twelve World Series in fourteen years.In this unparalleled memoir, Mickey Mantle recounts both the joys and agonies of his rise from small-town Oklahoma, where he listened to the World Series on the radio, to his successes on the field and the many injuries he overcame in order to make it to twelve World Series. From the 1951 Series, when he played alongside the aging Joe DiMaggio, to 1964, when he belted three Series home runs, Mantle relives every one of his World Series games, moment by moment. These were the games that counted, when the nation held its breath on every pitch and Mantle and his Yankee teammates rose to the occasion and achieved the legendary string of championships that remains unsurpassed, even in this era of superstar athletes.Mantle also speaks candidly about the parties and celebrations that were part of a young professional athlete's lifestyle; there was never a shortage of alcohol in the world of baseball, and here, in a moving epilogue, Mantle traces the roots of the alcoholism with which he recently came to terms and conquered with the help of a loving family, friends, and thousands of fans.The classic tale of a player and his team seizing their destiny and reaching the pinnacle of success over and over again, All My Octobers is also the story of a man from small-town America who remains an idol to this day, his raw talent, grace and courage bridging generations and confirming his place as a living legend.",

A shy, awkward girl with an overbearing stepfather and a bookworm mother, Holland surprises everyone by growing up into the confident, brainy, successful writer she is today.

Uncovering layers of mistakes that have shaped human history, Eco offers with wit and clarity such instances as Columbus's voyage to the New World, the fictions that grew around the Rosicrucians and Knights Templar, and the linguistic endeavors to recreate the language of Babel, to show how serendipities can evolve out of mistakes. With erudition, anecdotes, and scholarly rigor, this new collection of essays is sure to entertain and enlighten any reader with a passion for the curious history of languages and ideas.",

        "Title": "The Woman Who Knew Gandhi: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Heller, Keith",
        "Description": "Based on an aside in Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography, in which he mentions a brief but seductive youthful flirtation with an Englishwoman, The Woman Who Knew Gandhi boldly imagines a long correspondence between a spiritual leader from the East and an ordinary woman from the West. In 1948, just after Gandhi's assassination, Martha Houghton receives a letter from Gandhi's son, who himself lies dying of tuberculosis in Bombay. Having found a stash of her letters to his father, he asks to meet her. The request sends Martha into a tailspin, for her husband knows nothing of her lifelong friendship with Gandhi.   Martha and her husband are forced to reevaluate their long marriage, and she must find a way to reconcile the disparate halves of her life. Moreover, their small community becomes a magnet for the press, and Martha finds her words twisted and used against her. Ultimately, she must decide whether to meet her old son's friend on his deathbed, or to remain in England and mend the rift in her marriage. Charmingly and elegantly written, The Woman Who Knew Gandhi explores the many definitions of love and friendship and the surprises of marriage.",

        "Description": "Both a love story and a reporter\u2019s first draft of history, Honeymoon in Tehran is a stirring, trenchant, and deeply personal chronicle of two years in the maelstrom of Iranian life. In 2005, Azadeh Moaveni, longtime Middle East correspondent for Time magazine, returns to Iran to cover the rise of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As she documents the firebrand leader\u2019s troublesome entry onto the world stage, Moaveni richly portrays a society too often caricatured as the heartland of militant Islam. Living and working in Tehran, she finds a nation that openly yearns for freedom and contact with the West, but whose economic grievances and nationalist spirit find a temporary outlet in Ahmadinejad\u2019s strident pronouncements. Mingling with underground musicians, race car drivers, young radicals, and scholars, she explores the cultural identity crisis and class frustration that pits Iran\u2019s next generation against the Islamic system. And then the unexpected happens: Azadeh falls in love with a young Iranian man and decides to get married and start a family in Tehran. Suddenly, she finds herself navigating an altogether different side of Iranian life. Preparing to be wed by a mullah, she sits in on a government marriage prep class where young couples are instructed to enjoy sex. She visits Tehran\u2019s bridal bazaar and finds that the Iranian wedding has become an outrageously lavish\u2013though often still gender-segregated\u2013production. When she becomes pregnant, she must prepare to give birth in an Iranian hospital, at the same time observing her friends\u2019 struggles with their young children, who must learn to say one thing at home and another at school.Despite her busy schedule as a wife and mother, Azadeh continues to report for Time on Iran\u2019s nuclear standoff with the West and Iranians\u2019 dissatisfaction with Ahmadinejad\u2019s heavy-handed rule. But as women are arrested on the street for \u201cimmodest dress\u201d and the authorities unleash a campaign of intimidation against journalists, the country\u2019s dark side reemerges. This fundamentalist turn, along with the chilling presence of \u201cMr. X,\u201d the government agent assigned to mind her every step, forces Azadeh to make the hard decision that her family\u2019s future lies outside Iran. Powerful and poignant, fascinating and humorous Honeymoon in Tehran is the harrowing story of a young woman\u2019s tenuous life in a country she thought she could change.",

Now, with a historian\u2019s sweep and an insider\u2019s eye for telling detail, Sanger delivers an urgent intelligence briefing on the world America faces. In a riveting narrative, The Inheritance describes the huge costs of distraction and lost opportunities at home and abroad as Iraq soaked up manpower, money, and intelligence capabilities. The 2008 market collapse further undermined American leadership, leaving the new president with a set of challenges unparalleled since Franklin D. Roosevelt entered the Oval Office.Sanger takes readers into the White House Situation Room to reveal how Washington penetrated Tehran\u2019s nuclear secrets, leading President Bush, in his last year, to secretly step up covert actions in a desperate effort to delay an Iranian bomb. Meanwhile, his intelligence chiefs made repeated secret missions to Pakistan as they tried to stem a growing insurgency and cope with an ally who was also aiding the enemy\u2013while receiving billions in American military aid. Now the new president faces critical choices: Is it better to learn to live with a nuclear Iran or risk overt or covert confrontation? Is it worth sending U.S. forces deep into Pakistani territory at the risk of undermining an unstable Pakistani government sitting on a nuclear arsenal? It is a race against time and against a new effort by Islamic extremists\u2013never before disclosed\u2013to quietly infiltrate Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons program. \u201cBush wrote a lot of checks,\u201d one senior intelligence official told Sanger, \u201cthat the next president is going to have to cash.\u201dThe Inheritance takes readers to Afghanistan, where Bush never delivered on his promises for a Marshall Plan to rebuild the country, paving the way for the Taliban\u2019s return. It examines the chilling calculus of North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Il, who built actual weapons of mass destruction in the same months that the Bush administration pursued phantoms in Iraq, then sold his nuclear technology in the Middle East in an operation the American intelligence apparatus missed. And it explores how China became one of the real winners of the Iraq war, using the past eight years to expand its influence in Asia, and lock up oil supplies in Africa while Washington was bogged down in the Middle East. Yet Sanger, a former foreign correspondent in Asia, sees enormous potential for the next administration to forge a partnership with Beijing on energy and the environment. At once a secret history of our foreign policy misadventures and a lucid explanation of the opportunities they create, The Inheritance is vital reading for anyone trying to understand the extraordinary challenges that lie ahead.",

        "Title": "The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality",
        "Authors": "By Greene, Brian",
        "Description": "From Brian Greene, one of the world\u2019s leading physicists, comes a grand tour of the universe that makes us look at reality in a completely  different way.Space and time form the very fabric of the cosmos. Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past? Greene uses these questions to guide us toward modern science\u2019s new and deeper understanding of the universe. From Newton\u2019s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to Einstein\u2019s fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics\u2019 entangled arena where vastly distant objects can bridge their spatial separation to instantaneously coordinate their behavior or even undergo teleportation, Greene reveals our world to be very different from what common experience leads us to believe. Focusing on the enigma of time, Greene establishes that nothing in the laws of physics insists that it run in any particular direction and that \u201ctime\u2019s arrow\u201d is a relic of the universe\u2019s condition at the moment of the big bang. And in explaining the big bang itself, Greene shows how recent cutting-edge developments in superstring and M-theory may reconcile the behavior of everything from the smallest particle to the largest black hole. This startling vision culminates in a vibrant eleven-dimensional \u201cmultiverse,\u201d pulsating with ever-changing textures, where space and time themselves may dissolve into subtler, more fundamental entities.Sparked by the trademark wit, humor, and brilliant use of analogy that have made The Elegant Universe a modern classic, Brian Greene takes us all, regardless of our scientific backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world.With 146 illustrationsJacket photograph by DB Image/Brand X Pictures",

        "Description": "The question of what happens to us after we die is on the minds of many? Can you prove to them that there is a God? What about evolution? Can the Bible be proven true? This book, which is inspired by conversations with lost people, is written specifically to those who have objections or are seeking answers for eternity, and guiding them to truth. Why have so many atheists, agnostics, Muslims, Catholics, prisoners, and soldiers become born again after reading One Heartbeat Away? As best-selling author Mark Cahill suggests, it's because once you know the truth about the Bible, creation vs. evolution, heaven and hell, sin, and the cross, there is only one logical decision to make. The truth does set you free! Get this book into the hands of family, friends, and strangers, and watch the Holy Spirit work wonders in their lives. It also appeals to Christians who want answers to the questions they get when witnessing. One Heartbeat Away promises to be as compelling as Mark Cahill's first book One Thing You Can't Do in Heaven. Both books have tremendous value in skillfully communicating the evidence for biblical truth and compelling the lost to come to Jesus Christ for salvation.",

The oldest ballpark in the major leagues, the last of the single-deck theaters, Fenway Park has inspired more lavish praise and outrageous comparison than any American sports arena in history. With its ominous Green Monster, the lone red seat that marks Ted Williams's record-setting longest home run, the hand-operated scoreboard at the base of the Wall, the fishbowl-style luxury \"600 Club\" with the press box perched high above, and the Hall of Fame faces, who could mistake Fenway Park for any other? Beautifully illustrated with Stan Grossfeld's prize-winning color photography, and written with an obvious love of the place, including interviews with an illustrious list of fans, players, coaches, and celebrities, FENWAY: A BIOGRAPHY IN WORDS AND PICTURES showcases the grand old park and memorializes it for generations of fans to come.",

In short, she's a Yummy Mummy, one of a new breed who manage to make motherhood look positively sexy. Under Alice's tutelage, Amy discovers that she's got some yumminess of her own. Joe takes notice, as does her handsome Pilates instructor. But once Amy's libido awakens from its extended slumber, a whole new set of problems develops.Filled with acute perceptions of the challenges faced by new moms, as well as the uniquely terrifying landscape of new motherhood, The Yummy Mummy is as endearing -- and as refreshing -- as a baby who sleeps through the night.",

According to the law of attraction, you can have virtually anything desired if your mind is trained to put out continual thoughts to attract it into your life.In this deeply compelling work, Ed Gungor seeks to establish a more complete and accurate representation of the power of the mind by explaining the role that God plays in the equation. This book is not written to attack but rather to examine what the author believes is misguided advice while still speaking to the heart-felt need that is causing so many to explore this ancient practice. Some of his views may surprise you. There is more to the story that must be told.",
