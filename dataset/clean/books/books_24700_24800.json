Finding the loving, committed relationship you want shouldn\u2019t mean throwing away your hopes, your integrity, or your heart. In Boy Meets Girl, Joshua Harris \u2014the guy who kissed dating goodbye\u2014makes the case for courtship. As old-fashioned as it might sound, courtship is what modern day relationships desperately need. Think of it as romance chaperoned by wisdom, cared for by community, and directed by God\u2019s Word. Filled with inspiring stories from men and women who have rediscovered courtship, Boy Meets Girl is honest, romantic, and refreshingly biblical.

Boy Meets Girl answers those questions. Now as a happily married man I can look back on my courtship with Shannon and see from personal experience that God is faithful. If you trust Him enough to wait on romance in dating, He will lovingly guide you as you pursue it in courtship\u2026right to that wonderful moment when you kneel together at the altar.\u201d \u2014 Joshua Harris",

So she's relieved to be back home on New York's Upper West Side, gossiping with her old pal P.J. Cullen, a transplanted Texan who's currently stage-managing a production of Peter Pan. With P.J. around, it doesn't take long for Josh to catch up on the theatre world's latest buzz - especially with P.J. providing entertaining but scathing reviews of Peter Pan's director and star, the wildly egotistic, undeniably middle-aged Rich Rafelson.As it turns out, Rafelson's run as Peter Pan is as short-lived as it is high-flown, for at the first preview as he soars above the stage his harness breaks, plunging him downward to death. Worse yet, as stage manager, P.J. ends up being the lead suspect in backstage foul play. It's time for Josh to wend her way through the growing number of suspects' bedrooms and her old police-precinct haunts in an all-out effort to save her friend. Along the way, as usual, she mingles with a fascinating cast of characters, from a sassy, hyper woman lawyer who discovers love on the boards to a salty police sergeant to a steady-Eddie carpenter who throws a monkey wrench into the proceedings.New York isn't the quiet town Josh thought she was coming home to, and it starts to feel rather small when her East and West Coast beaux collide. Josh doesn't miss a cue in the middle of all this high drama, though, proving once again that she's at the top of her form when it comes to murder, men, and mayhem.",

But after the bridge club's money is stolen, the townspeople decide that there is more to this mystery. The rash of petty thievery started when banker Willard Carmichael and his much younger (and flashier) wife, Danielle, moved to Pickax from Down Below. Along with their big-city lifestyle, Willard brought plans to restore the Victorian houses on Gingerbread Alley (fondly known as Pleasant Street). Unfortunately, Willard is murdered in an apparent mugging Down Below.When a local man is accused of the thievery, newspaper columnist Jim Qwilleran has serious questions about the recent crimes plaguing Pickax. For one thing, Danielle's cousin Carter Lee seems too eager to pick up where Willard left off in the restoration project. When he begins to romance wealthy widow Lynette Duncan, things really go awry. It's up to Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum to set the town right and bring the guilty party to justice before both the Duncan family fortune and Pickax are destroyed by greed.",

        "Title": "Seizing Destiny: How America Grew from Sea to Shining Sea",
        "Authors": "By Kluger, Richard",
        "Description": "From the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning social historian Richard Kluger, Seizing Destiny is a sweeping chronicle of how the vast territory of the United States was assembled to accommodate the aspirations of its people\u2014regardless of who objected. It is a remarkable story of how Americans extended their sovereignty from the Atlantic coastline to the mid-Pacific in the first 125 years of their national existence.America\u2019s surge to dominion was equally admirable and appalling. The nation\u2019s pioneer generations were, to be sure, blessed with remarkable energy, fortitude, and boundless faith in their own prowess. They were also grasping opportunists, ravenous in their hunger to possess the earth, who justified their often brutal aggression by demeaning the humanity of nonwhites.These visionary nation-builders proclaimed earnestly, if not innocently, their own rectitude to be the force behind the heroic \u201ctaming\u201d of the wilderness and saw in this triumph the hand of Providence. Their good fortune was thus transformed into a mission of continental entitlement\u2014their \u201cmanifest destiny,\u201d as they began calling it well after the process was under way. Yet declaring it did not make it so. As we see, luck and their foes\u2019 weaknesses played no less a role. In a compelling drama, vivid with historical detail, we watch three of the most brilliant Founding Fathers\u2014Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and John Adams\u2014outfox British, French, and Spanish diplomats to win more than ample boundaries for their new republic. Finesse, however, had little to do with General Andrew Jackson\u2019s Indian-slaughtering and disdain for the Spanish garrison in capturing Florida. Or with Secretary of State John Quincy Adams\u2019s bluff and bluster in gaining for the nation a northwest passage to the Pacific. Or with how the singleminded James Polk, devious and manipulative, confected a war with Mexico and thereby amassed more land than any other U.S. President.We learn why the nation\u2019s most famous acquisition, France\u2019s Louisiana Territory, had little to do with Thomas Jefferson\u2019s foresight and everything to do with Napoleon\u2019s failure to subdue black freedom fighters in the jungles of Haiti. Sam Houston tried vainly to prevent the predictably suicidal defense of the Alamo before he could rally rowdy Texans to win their independence. William Seward, in just one week, overcame political disrepute and convinced a hostile Senate to approve his secret deal with Russia to buy seemingly useless Alaska. And Teddy Roosevelt connived with the Panamanians to win land for the canal that so enhanced America\u2019s economic dominance.Comprehensive and balanced, Seizing Destiny is a stunning reinterpretation of American history, revealing great accomplishments along with the American tendency to confuse success with heaven-sent entitlement.",

This smart, funny, and enlightening book mingles scientific analysis with the human story to demonstrate how a world free of technological excess can shrink stress -- and waistlines -- and expand happiness, health, and leisure.This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",

You may be twelve or thirteen and just beginning the teen years; fifteen or sixteen and about to get your driver's license; or seventeen or eighteen and about to graduate from high school.     These are the years someone once called the \"tween\" years. In today's high-pressure, fast-paced world, it's not easy being a teenager. You're faced with difficult situations every day. Friends or peers may pressure you to do things you don't want to do. They may pressure you to do things you might want to do, but know you shouldn't. What you need is the strength, resolve and encouragement to pass up those temporarily enticing and exciting things in order to work towards God's destiny in your life.     God does have a plan for your life. His plan is a good one. He has a plan for you to prosper. His plan will give you hope and a bright future. God's Little Devotional Book for Teens was designed to encourage and inspire you to discover, desire and implement God's divine plan for your life.

For more than twenty years, the New York Times bestselling author of the classic Shannara epic has proven himself one of the modern masters of fantasy, winning the hearts and minds of devoted readers around the world. In his last acclaimed novel, Ilse Witch, a brave company of explorers led by the last Druid, Walker Boh, traveled across unknown seas in search of an elusive magic. Yet perhaps Boh and his team were lured there for sinister, unforeseen purposes . . .Now in Antrax, as the crew aboard the airship Jerle Shannara is attacked by evil forces, the Druid\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Bek Rowe and his companions are pursued by the mysterious Ilse Witch. Meanwhile, Boh is alone, caught in a dark maze beneath the ruined city of Castledown, stalked by a hungry, unseen enemy. For there is something alive in Castledown. Something not human. Something old beyond reckoning that covets the magic of Druids, elves, even the Ilse Witch. Something that hunts men for its own designs: Antrax. It is a spirit that commands ancient technologies and mechanical monsters, feeds off enchantment, and traps the souls of men.With the Jerle Shannara under siege and Antrax threatening the bold and unwary, the Ilse Witch finds herself face-to-face with a boy who claims to be the brother she last saw as an infant. Now a young man, Bek wields the magic of the wishsong and carries the Sword of Shannara upon his back. Unsure whether to trust Bek or to slay him, the Ilse Witch takes him prisoner. One has come pursuing truth, the other revenge. Yet both seek Walker Boh\u2013with the fate of the Four Lands hanging in the balance. Return to the world of beloved novelist Terry Brooks, where creatures drift up from the earth like mist, a hypnotic song can kill, a sword can cut through a veil of lies\u2013and one man, the true heir of an ancient magic, must choose between betrayal and redemption.",

It didn't matter that Jeff Gordon hailed from California -- hardly a fountain of stockcar pedigree -- or that they said he was too small to race with the big boys on the dirt tracks and ovals of his youth. It didn't matter that Dale Earnhardt called this upstart \"Wonderboy\" -- no one raced the legendary Earnhardt harder, and no two drivers had more respect for each other. And it didn't matter that the racing world said Gordon was finished with the breakup of the crew on the #24 car and the departure of Ray Evernham, his crew chief, in 1999 -- he came back two seasons later to win a record-equaling fourth Winston Cup, this time with Robbie Loomis as crew chief. In the end, all that matters is that Jeff Gordon is the greatest living NASCAR champion, and it only remains to be seen just how many championships he can win.  But what's it really like to climb into a stockcar every weekend and challenge for a championship? Offering a never-before-seen entry into the thrilling world of NASCAR racing, Jeff Gordon takes us into the cockpit of the #24 DuPont Chevrolet car; right into the garages where his cars are made; and inside the lives and efforts of his extraordinary team, the Rainbow Warriors. Just how does his car get built, tested, and driven, and how do these personalities mesh into a championship team? Along the way we find out what he thinks of life as both a NASCAR champion and a never-left-alone celebrity, where he came from and to whom he owes all his successes, and  above all, what it takes to be a champion in one of the most dangerous and thrilling sports of all.  Jeff Gordon: Racing Back to the Front -- My Memoir is a pit pass all its own, giving passionate NASCAR fans unique access into the life and career of one of the most storied champions in the sport.",

So at the age of twelve, Burroughs found himself amidst Victorian squalor living with the doctor's bizarre family, and befriending a pedophile who resided in the backyard shed. The story of an outlaw childhood where rules were unheard of, and the Christmas tree stayed up all year round, where Valium was consumed like candy, and if things got dull an electroshock- therapy machine could provide entertainment. The funny, harrowing and bestselling account of an ordinary boy's survival under the most extraordinary circumstances.Running with Scissors AcknowledgmentsGratitude doesn't begin to describe it: Jennifer Enderlin, Christopher Schelling, John Murphy, Gregg Sullivan, Kim Cardascia, Michael Storrings, and everyone at St. Martin's Press.

I would also like to express my appreciation to my mother and father for, no matter how inadvertently, giving me such a memorable childhood. Additionally, I would like to thank the real-life members of the family portrayed in this book for taking me into their home and accepting me as one of their own. I recognize that their memories of the events described in this book are different than my own. They are each fine, decent, and hard-working people. The book was not intended to hurt the family. Both my publisher and I regret any unintentional harm resulting from the publishing and marketing of Running with Scissors. Most of all, I would like to thank my brother for demonstrating, by example, the importance of being wholly unique.",

From Julius Caesar to Joan of Arc to Gandhi, many of history's greatest figures have become inextricably bound to their screen images.It may not be the job of filmmakers to ensure the historical accuracy of these films, especially when deviation serves a compelling dramatic purpose. But wouldn't it be useful - and fascinating - to learn what has been changed, and for what reason? In Past Imperfect: History According to the Movies, sixty of the world's most lauded historical writers look beneath the celluloid surface of popular movies to examine the relationship between film and the historical record.Beginning with a probing conversation between historian Eric Foner and director John Sayles (Eight Men Out, Matewan), Past Imperfect surveys nearly one hundred classic films, including Spartacus, Gone with the Wind, The Grapes of Wrath, and Malcolm X. Best-selling authors such as Gore Vidal, James M. McPherson, Antonia Fraser, William Manchester, and Simon Schama skewer, praise, pick apart, and otherwise illuminate these cinematic portrayals of history, telling us as much about what the filmmakers got right as about where they went wrong.",

        "Description": "A gripping and explosive new thriller from internationally acclaimed forensic anthropologist and New York Times bestselling author Kathy Reichs, featuring Temperance Brennan and Detective Andrew Ryan on the trail of a modern murder and an ancient biblical mystery...  When an Orthodox Jewish man is found shot to death in Montreal, Temperance Brennan is called in to examine the body and to figure out the puzzling damage to the corpse. Unexpectedly, a stranger slips her a photograph of a skeleton and assures her it is the key to the victim's death. Before she knows it, Tempe is involved in an international mystery as old as Jesus, and one that could lead to the rewriting of two thousand years of religious history.  As Tempe investigates, she learns that the stranger's picture shows bones uncovered during an archaeological dig. She discovers the Montreal shooting victim ran an import business that just might have been a front for the trading of black market antiquities. Along with Detective Andrew Ryan and biblical archaeologist Jake Drum, Tempe travels to Israel to probe the origins of the skeleton and the ancient crypt in which it was found. Together they make a startling discovery that raises radical questions about Christ's death and places them squarely in the middle of a swirling controversy. Could one of the tombs really be Christ's last resting place? Are the bones in the ancient ossuary the last remnants of James, the brother of Jesus, as the inscription claims? Or has someone concocted an elaborate hoax?  Using her skills as a forensic scientist, Tempe plunges into the most controversial case of her career. The stakes have never been higher -- the more she learns, the greater the danger. And though Ryan is sexier and more engaging than ever, he may not be able to protect Tempe in this place where there seem to be so many foes.  Cross Bones, with its lightning pace, intricately plotted story, riveting and state-of-the-art forensic detail, is Kathy Reichs's most compelling and dramatic novel yet.",

And, whether she fulfills her life's ambition or not, she can already lay claim to being the first woman ever considered a serious contender for the presidency.From the beginning, there have been the inevitable comparisons to Argentina's legendary Eva Per\u00f3n. Sex, power, money, lies, scandal, tragedy, and betrayal were the things that defined the lives of both women. Yet most of what we know about Hillary Rodham Clinton is seen in the context of her tumultuous marriage to the 42nd President. Now a power in the Senate, Hillary waits for the right moment to make her own run for the White House. In the style of his #l New York Times bestsellers The Day Diana Died and The Day John Died, as well as Jack and Jackie, Jackie After Jack, George and Laura and  Sweet Caroline,  Christopher Andersen draws on important sources -- many speaking here for the first time -- to paint a startling portrait of America's most controversial woman.  Among the revelations:How U.S. history has been shaped -- and will continue to be shaped -- by the arrangement between Hillary and Bill known as \"The Plan.\"Important new details about the role Hillary played in the scandalous eleventh hour pardons of armed radicals, drug dealers, tax cheats, embezzlers, money launderers and more.How the outgoing First Lady registered like a bride at a gift store and left the White House with $400,000 worth of \"gifts\" belonging to the American people.How JFK Jr. almost thwarted her Senate plans.New details about Hillary's relationship with Vince Foster.How Hillary has coped with Bill's hundreds of affairs, and the new women in her husband's life.What Martha Stewart did for Hillary, and how Hillary repaid her.How Hillary is using the 2004 elections as a springboard to her own future presidential candidacy\u2014regardless of who wins.Whatever the ultimate judgment of history, the ongoing saga of Hillary Clinton's inexorable rise to power continues to stir passions, and to make her the American Evita.",

It was a powerful yet precarious position for the British Prime Minister, as he fought for his own future in backing George W. Bush and sending Britain's forces into Iraq. In this gripping day-by-day chronicle, Peter Stothard takes us behind the scenes as no one has before to reveal a unique portrait of a political leader under fire at the center of the world stage.Over a period of four weeks in March and April of 2003, Tony Blair risked his status as the United Kingdom's most successful Labour Prime Minister for the chance of an unknowable place in history. Before Britain could help the United States, Blair faced a battle against his own voters, his own party, and his own allies in Europe. These were among the most tense and tumultuous weeks the world had seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In thirty days, Blair took on his opponents and won.Through it all, Peter Stothard had unprecedented access to Blair, from Ten Downing Street and the House of Commons through the war summits in the Azores, Brussels, Belfast, and Camp David. No writer has ever been so close to a world head of state for so long at such a critical moment. Stothard brings us inside the corridors of power during this extraordinary time, offering a vivid, up-close view of an enormously popular leader facingthe challenge of his life. How Blair spent those thirty days, how he fought for his own future as well as his vision of the civilized world, how he changed, and why he survived are at the heart of this riveting inside account.",

Your success at any management level depends largely on your ability to deal with other people. In this business-oriented approach to interpersonal relationships, management experts Robert Bolton and Dorothy Grover Bolton show you how to assess various behavior patterns and how to use that knowledge to capitalize on your strengths, minimize your weaknesses, and get the results you want from others. Are you predominantly an Amiable, an Analytical, an Expressive, or a Driver? Nearly everyone, according to Boltons' extensive research, uses on of the four basic social styles more often than the others. No style is better than any other, but each does bring with it a unique pattern of strengths and weaknesses. This book shows you not only how to recognize your particular style but also how to use that knowledge to manage others more effectively, set appropriate life goals and career paths, plan a sound self-improvement plan, increase your creativity, and more. Te best managers, claim the Boltons, excel at being what they are rather than at trying to be what they are not. If you feel that your effectiveness at work could be increased by better interpersonal skills but are tired of theories that want you to overhaul yourself to fit some uncomfortable, impersonal \"\"management style,\"\" then let Social Style/Management Style improve your dealings with others and still let you be yourself.",

Now, in his long-awaited second book, McBride turns his highly acclaimed talent as a storyteller to fiction.  Based on the historical incident of an unspeakable massacre at the site of St. Anna Di Stazzema, a small village in Tuscany, and on the experiences of the famed Buffalo soldiers from the 92nd Division in Italy during World War II, Miracle of St. Anna is a singular evocation of war, cruelty, passion, and heroism. It is the story of four American Negro soldiers, a band of partisans, and an Italian boy who encounter a miracle-though perhaps the true miracle lies in themselves.  Traversing class, race, and geography, Miracle at St. Anna is above all a hymn to the brotherhood of man and the power to do good that lives in each of us. It reveals to us a little-known but fascinating moment in history through the eyes and imagination of a gifted writer.
