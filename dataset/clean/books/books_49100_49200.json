        "Title": "The Hearts Of Horses",
        "Authors": "By Gloss, Molly",
        "Description": "This breakout novel from the author of The Jump-Off Creek tells the heartwarming story of a determined young woman with a gift for \u201cgentling\u201d wild horses.In the winter of 1917, a big-boned young woman shows up at George Bliss\u2019s doorstep. She's looking for a job breaking horses, and he hires her on. Many of his regular hands are off fighting the war, and he glimpses, beneath her showy rodeo garb, a shy but strong-willed girl with a serious knowledge of horses.So begins the irresistible tale of nineteen-year-old Martha Lessen, a female horse whisperer trying to make a go of it in a man\u2019s world. It was thought that the only way to break a horse was to buck the wild out of it, and broken ribs and tough falls just went with the job. But over several long, hard winter months, many of the townsfolk in this remote county of eastern Oregon witness Martha's way of talking in low, sweet tones to horses believed beyond repair\u2014and getting miraculous, almost immediate results\u2014and she thereby earns a place of respect in the community.Along the way, Martha helps a family save their horses when their wagon slides into a ravine. She gentles a horse for a dying man\u2014a last gift to his young son. She clashes with a hired hand who is abusing horses in unspeakable ways. Soon, despite her best efforts to remain aloof and detached, she comes to feel enveloped by a sense of community and family that she\u2019s never had before.With the elegant sweetness of Plainsong and a pitch-perfect sense of western life reminiscent of Annie Dillard, The Hearts of Horses is a remarkable story about how people and animals make connections and touch each other's lives in the most unexpected and profound ways.",

        "Description": "If you're like most folks, you were raised to be \"nice\". Yet now you find yourself asking: \"If I'm so nice, why isn't my life better?\" Renowned minister and lecturer Duke Robinson has the answer.

Now Robinson outlines the nine unconscious mistakes nice people make daily, and he shows how to correct them and avoid unnecessary stress with life-affirming actions. Learn how to: -- Say \"no\" and save yourself from burnout-- Tell others what you want, and actually receive it-- Express anger in healing ways that maintain valued relationships-- Respond effectively when i0rrationally criticized or attacked-- Liberate your true self.Are you, like many of us, too nice for your own good?

All is made possible by advanced technology - bioengineering and nano-machines, virtual reality and the harnessing of the force of gravity.But not everyone can handle all this high tech. Not every person is capable of mastering the arts of programming on the fly in the virtual world, or manipulating the microscopic matter of biotech and nanotech. For most people, the idea of being in more than two places at once is more than a little disorienting.So a special kind of human has evolved - men and women who can handle both the virtual world and the realized world. Who can do two and more things at once, who are smarter and more creative than average. They are the Aristoi, the Best, and as in Plato's vision, they have the care of the Demos, the people, foremost in their minds. The Aristoi control technology and all its fruits. They terraform planets, and when they are done, they choose the people who can emigrate to the new world. They are the absolute rulers of their spheres of creation, but they are benevolent rulers.What can trouble Paradise? The answer is an Aristos gone mad. An Aristos so committed to a genetic theory that he makes a whole world in secret, cut off from the Hyperlogos that records all knowledge and all actions, in order to test his theories. And who will kill to keep his secret safe.",

No bibliography mentions the 1969 edition. If it indeed exists, it could be worth a fortune to the right collector. It's the kind of book somebody might kill for. In fact, somebody probably already has.Ex-Denver cop Cliff Janeway is happily at work selling rare and used books when one day a former police colleague, Clydell Slater, arrives with an offer. Janeway never did much care for Slater, and he doesn't like him any better now, but Slater's proposal is intriguing. Slater runs a detective agency, and he wants Janeway to go to Seattle to pick up a young woman fugitive and deliver her to her bail bondsman and a district court in Taos, New Mexico. The woman is wanted for burglary and assault. She may also have stolen a copy of the 1969 Grayson Press Raven when she ransacked a Taos house.The rare-book angle gets to Janeway every time. He could say no to a five thousand-dollar fee, even though the money could buy him some special books, but he couldn't turn down a chance to find a hitherto unknown copy of The Raven.Janeway flies to Seattle, finds his \"skip,\" discovers she shares his love of books, takes her on a scouting expedition through some of the city's best rare-book haunts, then loses her on the way to the airport.She's young and frightened, alone on the streets of a big city with some very nasty men after her. Janeway signed onto the case because of a book, but he stays because of a vulnerable young woman whose heart belongs to books, but whose eyes are filled with pain. He will discover not only her story, but the poignant tale of a once-great small press, where paper and ink became books in the hands of a master craftsman.",

Then, in Harry Turtledove's brilliantly imagined Worldwar saga, an alien invasion changed everything: alliances, technology, commerce, and - most of all - the nature of life and death. Nuclear destruction engulfed some of Earth's great cities, and the invaders claimed half the planet before an uneasy peace could be achieved.Colonization takes us into the tumultuous 1960s, as the reptilian Race ponders its uneasy future on the planet it calls Tosev 3. The United States has prospered since the war, and has sent a manned spaceship deep into space. On the other side of the globe, the German Reich remains bloodied but unbowed, brandishing a frightening new weapon and always poised for war. China strains under alien occupation, and from Poland to Jerusalem, Jews must choose between aiding the Race or the Reich. Now the invaders have been joined by their colonization fleet - millions of newcomers who seek to incorporate our world into their far-flung empire.A violent black market erupts around ginger - the one substance that deprives the alien colonists of their ability to reason - and a new war threatens, one even deadlier than the last. The tribes of Earth form new alliances and play dangerous games of diplomacy, but the ultimate power broker will be the Race itself. With a vast, ancient empire already in place, the Race has the power to annihilate every living being on Tosev 3 ...",

In it he resurrects forgotten language in the U.S. Constitution\u2014and hints at a missing letter of Thomas Jefferson's\u2014that threatens to divide the nation.Then, during a publicity tour, Scarborough is brutally murdered in a San Diego hotel room, and a young man with dark connections is charged.

He believes that there is much more to the case and that the defendant is a pawn caught in the middle, being scapegoated by circumstance.As the trial spirals toward its conclusion, Madriani and his partner, Harry Hinds, race to find the missing Jefferson letter\u2014and the secrets it holds about slavery and scandal at the time of our nation's founding and the very reason Scarborough was killed.

Now she\u2019s ready to take on the thirtysomething years . . . and almost middle age has never been more hilarious.Laurie is married, mortgaged, and now\u2014miraculously\u2014employed in the corporate world, discovering that bosses come in all shapes, sizes, and degrees of mental stability. After maxing out her last good credit card at Banana Republic, she\u2019s dressed for success and ready to face the jungle: surviving feral, six-foot-plus Gretchen (\u201cThree Thousand Faces of Eve\u201d) before battling the overbearing, overstuffed (in way-too-small pants) new mom Suzzi, who ruthlessly cancels Laurie\u2019s newspaper column and learns that payback can be a bitch. Laurie also explores the backstabbing world of preschoolers at a Halloween party, the X-rated madness of a family trip to Disneyland, and the pressure from her QVC-addicted mother and the rest of the world to reproduce. But while losing more friends to babies than to booze, she realizes there\u2019s a plus side: at least for a couple of months she gets to be the thinner friend. I Love Everybody (and Other Atrocious Lies) is Laurie Notaro at her deliciously quirky best. Can a woman prone to what her loved ones might term \u201cmeltdowns\u201d (she considers them \u201cOpportunities to Enlighten\u201d) put a smile on her face and love everybody? Take a guess.",

        "Title": "A Stake in the Outcome: Building a Culture of Ownership for the Long-Term Success of Your Business",
        "Authors": "By Stack, Jack and Burlingham, Bo",
        "Description": "The First Management Classic of the New Millennium!A bold experiment is taking place these days, as leading-edge companies turn upside down the management paradigm that has dominated corporate thinking for more than one hundred years. Southwest Airlines is perhaps the most visible practitioner, soaring through economic downturns while its competitors slash their budgets and order massive layoffs, but you can find other pioneers of the new approach in almost every industry and market niche. Their secret: a culture of ownership that allows them to tap into the most underutilized resource in business today\u2013namely, the enthusiasm, intelligence, and creativity of working people everywhere.No one knows more about building a culture of ownership than CEO Jack Stack, who\u2019s been working on one for the past twenty years with his colleagues at SRC Holdings Corporation (formerly Springfield ReManufacturing Corporation). Along the way, they\u2019ve turned their company into what Business Week has called a \u201cmanagement Mecca,\u201d attracting thousands of people representing hundreds of businesses to SRC\u2019s home in Springfield, Missouri. There the visitors learn how to incorporate the ideals and values of SRC\u2019s remarkable corporate culture into their own organizations\u2013and then they go back and do it.Now, in A Stake in the Outcome, Stack offers a master class on creating a culture of ownership, presenting the hard-won lessons of his own twenty-year journey and explaining what it really takes to build for long-term success. The pioneer of \u201copen-book management\u201d (described in the best-selling classic The Great Game of Business), Stack and twelve other managers began their journey in 1982, when they purchased their factory from its struggling parent company. SRC grew 15 percent a year, while adding almost a thousand new jobs, and the company\u2019s stock price rocketed from 10 cents to $81.60 per share. In the process, Stack discovered that long-term success required constant innovation\u2013and that building a culture of ownership involved much more than paying bonuses, handing out stock options, or setting up an employee stock ownership plan. In a successful ownership culture, every employee had to take the fate of the company as personally as an individual owner would. Achieving that level of commitment was extraordinarily difficult, but Stack realized that the payoff would be enormous: a company that was consistently able to outperform the market.A Stake in the Outcome isn\u2019t about theory\u2013it\u2019s about practice. Stack draws from his own successes and failures at SRC to show how any company can teach its employees to think and act like owners, including how to implement an effective equity-sharing program, how to promote continuous learning at every level of the organization, how to fire up employees\u2019 competitive juices, how to broaden the concept of leadership and delegate responsibility for the business, and how to build a workforce that is fast on its feet and ready to take advantage of every opportunity. You\u2019ll also learn about other companies that have succeeded in building cultures of ownership\u2013and the lessons they can teach the rest of us.Written in Jack Stack\u2019s straightforward, witty, no-beating-around-the-bush style, A Stake in the Outcome is like having a one-on-one session with a master entrepreneur and business innovator. It shows managers and executives of companies both large and small how to build a ferociously motivated workforce that is energized and committed to meeting and overcoming the most daunting challenges a company can face.",

Tempest sports a modest suit, while Janessa runs wild in a skintight minidress -- but they both want the same thing: the heat, the passion, the spark to ignite the sensual fires inside. It takes time and patience to find such a special lover. But somewhere among the freaks and fruitcakes, they know there's a match for each of them.  Tall, dark, and hands-on...  The last thing Geren wants is a relationship -- most women can't see past his money and his good looks. His best friend Dvont\u00e8 is a player, with sex -- and definitely not commitment -- on his mind. But when Dvont\u00e8 talks Geren into going clubbing, fate leads them to Tempest and Janessa. Attractions flare, connections are made, lives are changed -- and secrets come to light. Together, they are the heat seekers, four daring hearts willing to play with fire -- and take the risk of getting burned....",

While the United States debates the best way to solve the situation in Iraq, the terrorists are claiming victory\u00a0and planning to take their show to American soil once again.\u00a0Drawing from extensive interviews with prime ministers, CIA directors, and other insiders, Evans looks at the history and ideology behind the Islamic revolution to explore its very real threat to U.S. interests \u2014why radical Islamic terrorists will only step back when they fear us, why victory in Iraq is important to U.S. security, why the United States and Israel cannot sit idly by and let Iran achieve its desire for nuclear weapons, and why stabilization in Iraq now would sound defeat rather than victory.\u00a0The Final Move Beyond Iraq is a wake-up call to mobilize millions to action.

The brilliantly unorthodox Kylara Vatta, black-sheep scion of Vatta Transport Ltd., one of the galaxy\u2019s wealthiest merchant houses, is a heroine like no other, blessed with a killer instinct for business and for battle. Now, in the aftermath of cold-blooded assassinations that have left her parents dead and the Vatta shipping empire shattered, Kylara faces her greatest challenge yet.  There is a time for grief and a time for revenge. This is decidedly the latter. Placing her cousin Stella in command of the trading vessel Gary Tobai, Ky embarks aboard the captured pirate ship Fair Kaleen on a twofold mission: to salvage the family business and to punish those responsible for the killings . . . before they strike again.Since the network providing instantaneous communication between star systems has been sabotaged, news is hard to come by and available information impossible to trust. But as she travels from system to system, with Stella a step behind, Ky pieces together the clues and discovers a conspiracy of terrifying scope, breathtaking audacity, and utter ruthlessness.The only hope the independent systems and merchants  have against this powerful enemy is to band together. Unfortunately, because she commands a ship known to belong to a notorious pirate\u2013her own relative Osman Vatta, whom she killed for his part in her parents\u2019 deaths\u2013Ky is met with suspicion, if not outright hostility. Rumors swirl about her intent, her very identity. Soon even Stella begins to question her cousin\u2019s decisions and her authority to make them.Meanwhile, the conspiracy Ky hunts is hunting her in turn, with agents insinuated into every space station, every planetary government, every arm of the military, and every merchant house\u2013including her own. Before she can take the fight to the enemy, Kylara must survive a deadly minefield of deception and betrayal.",

        "Description": "When the Gospel of Judas was published by the National Geographic  Society in April 2006, it received extraordinary media attention  and was immediately heralded as a major biblical discovery that  rocked the world of scholars and laypeople alike. Elaine Pagels  and Karen King are the first to reflect on this newfound text and  its ramifications for telling the story of early Christianity. In  Reading Judas, the two celebrated scholars illustrate how the  newly discovered text provides a window onto understanding how  Jesus followers understood his death, why Judas betrayed Jesus,  and why God allowed it.   Most contemporary readers will find passages in the ancient  Gospel of Judas difficult to comprehend outside of its context in  the ancient world. Reading Judas illuminates the intellectual  assumptions behind Jesus teaching to Judas and shows how conflict  among the disciples was a tool frequently used by early Christian  authors to explore matters of doubt and disagreement. Presented  with the elegance, insight, and accessibility that has made  Pagels and King the leading voices in this field, this is a book  for academics and popular audience both. Pagels's five previous  books, including The New York Times bestseller Beyond Belief, and  Kings The Gospel of Mary of Magdala prove that there is a  considerable audience eager for this kind of informed and  engaging writing.",
