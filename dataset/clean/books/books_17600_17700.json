        "Authors": "By Picoult, Jodi",
        "Description": "Friendship, loyalty, lifelong love -- and teenage suicide. A riveting, timely, and terrifying novel from an acclaimed writer who skillfully intertwines the intimate perceptions of Anne Tyler with the dramatic tension of John Grisham The Golds and the Hartes, neighbors for eighteen years, have always been inseparable. So have their children-and it's no surprise that in high school Chris and Emily's friendship blossoms into something more. But the bonds of family, friendship, and passion-which had seemed so indestructible -- suddenly threaten to unravel in the wake of unexpected tragedy. When midnight calls from the hospital come in, no one is ready for the truth. Emily is dead at seventeen from a gunshot wound to the head. There's a single unspent bullet in the gun that Chris pilfered from his father's cabinet-a bullet that Chris tells police he intended for himself. But a local detective has doubts about the suicide pact that Chris describes.This extraordinary, heart-rending novel asks questions that every parent faces: How much do we know about our children? Our friends? What if . . .? As its chapters unfold, alternating between an idyllic past and an unthinkable present, The Pact paints an indelible portrait of families in anguish . . . and creates an astonishingly suspenseful courtroom drama, as Chris finds himself on trial for murder.It's rare to find a writer who combines Alice Hoffman's gift for evoking everyday life in pellucid prose with a remarkable ability to create a legal page-turner that will keep you up all night reading, but this is such a book. The Pact rings true: wonderfully observed, truly moving, frightening, and utterly impossible to put down.",

        "Description": "A tremendously vivid historical encounter becomes a larger-than-life canvas for this brilliant saga. The year is 1522. Two great leaders, twenty-five-year-old Suleiman the Magnificent, the absolute ruler of the mighty Ottoman Empire, and Philippe de L'Isle Adam, the grisly, fifty-eight-year-old Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes, come to war on the Greek island of Rhodes. For 145 days, Philippe and 500 European Knights fight to protect their fortressed city and withstand an assault of nearly 200,000 men from Suleiman's army, in a battle that becomes the historic hallmark for siege warfare.Authentic in all its historical detail, The Shadow of God evokes a seismic clash of cultures: Muslim versus Christian, the Ottoman Empire versus the last remaining Knights of the Crusades and, most important, two of the most powerful men of their time. Embedded in this fictional account is the secret marriage of a lovely Jewish nurse to her Christian French Knight, as well as the forbidden love of the Grand Master for the beautiful Helene. An epic of bravery and courage, The Shadow of God weaves a tapestry of beauty, terror and triumph set in a forgotten time of brutality and courage, loyalty and honor.\"So vividly rendered that historical fiction fans and medieval history enthusiasts will be crossing their fingers for a follow-up.\"-Publishers Weekly\"An engaging and well-written fictional account of the Ottoman Turks' 145-day siege of the Greek island of Rhodes.\"-Library Journal",

        "Authors": "By (WHISTLER, James McNeill)",
        "Description": "Whistler's Gentle Art, a classic in the literature of insult and denigration, might well be subtitled \"The Autobiography of a Hater,\" for it contains the deadly sarcasm and stinging remarks of one of the wittiest men of the nineteenth century. Whistler not only refused to tolerate misunderstanding by critics and the so-called art-loving public \u2014 but launched vicious counterattacks as well. His celebrated passages-at-arms with Oscar Wilde and Swinburne, the terse and penetrating \"letters to the editor,\" his rebuttals to attacks from critics, and biting marginal notes to contemptuous comments on his paintings and hostile reviews (which are also reprinted) are all part of this record of the artist's vendettas.Whistler's most famous battle began when critic John Ruskin saw one of the artist's \"Nocturnes\" exhibited in Grosvenor Gallery. \"I have seen, and heard,\" wrote Ruskin, \"much of cockney impudence before now; but never expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.\" Whistler was incensed with this criticism, and initiated the famous libel case \"Whistler vs. Ruskin.\" Extracts from the resultant trial record are among the highlights of this book, with Whistler brilliantly annihilating his Philistine critics, but winning only a farthing in damages.The Gentle Art, designed by Whistler himself, is a highly entertaining account of personal revenges, but it is also an iconoclast's plea for a new and better attitude toward painting. As a historical document, it is the best statement of the new aesthetics versus the old guard academics, and it helped greatly in shaping the modern feeling toward art.",

        "Title": "The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked",
        "Authors": "By Gelb, Leslie H.",
        "Description": "Few analysts of U.S. involvement in Vietnam would agree with the provocative conclusion of this book. The thesis of most postmortems is that the United States lost the war because of the failure of its foreign policy decisionmaking system. According to Gelb and Betts, however, the foreign policy failed, but the decisionmaking system worked.   They attribute this paradox to the efficiency of the system in sustaining an increasingly heavy commitment based on the shared conviction of six administrations that the United States must prevent the loss of Vietnam to communism. However questionable the conviction, and thus the commitment, may have been, the authors stress that the latter \"was made and kept for twenty-five years. That is what the system&#151;the shared values, the political and bureaucratic pressures&#151;was designed to do, and it did it.\"  The comprehensive analysis that supports this contention reflects the widest use thus fare of available sources, including recently declassified portions of negotiations documents and files in presidential libraries. The frequently quoted statement of the principals themselves contradict the commonly held view that U.S. leaders were unaware of the consequences of their decisions and deluded by false expectations of easy victory. With few exceptions, the record reveals that these leaders were both realistic and pessimistic about the chances for success in Vietnam. Whey they persisted nonetheless is explained in this thorough account of their decisionmaking from 1946 to 1968, and how their mistakes might be avoided by policymakers in the future is considered in the final chapter.",

        "Title": "Entertaining Science Experiments with Everyday Objects",
        "Authors": "By Gardner, Martin",
        "Description": "To Martin Gardner, seeing is not just believing \u2014 it is understanding. This fundamental rule has made him one of the most successful teachers and popularizers of science in America. With the simple instructions in this book and a few commonly available household objects, you or your child can easily learn even the most difficult scientific principles by directly experiencing how they work.Gardner shows you how to re-create classic experiments with easily obtainable objects. Using just a flashlight, a pocket mirror, and a bowl of water, you can demonstrate the color composition of white light just as Newton did 300 years ago. With cardboard, colored paper, and wax paper you can perform \"Meyer's experiment\" with complementary colors. You need only a playing card, a spool, and a thumbtack to demonstrate Bernoulli's principle of aerodynamics. A soda bottle filled with water, a few paper matches, and a toy balloon elucidate Pascal's law governing pressure in liquids. And two drinking glasses, some matches, and a piece of wet blotting paper re-create a famous experiment, first performed in 1650 in Magdeburg, Germany, that dramatically reveals the force of ordinary atmospheric pressure.In language simple enough to be easily understood by an 11-year-old, yet technically accurate and informative enough to benefit adults, and aided by Anthony Ravielli's clear illustrations, Gardner presents a splendid practical course in basic science and mathematics. While your child perplexes and delights his or her friends with a series of 100 amusing tricks and experiments, he or she is learning the principles of astronomy, chemistry, physiology, psychology, general mathematics, topology, probability, geometry, numbers, optics (light), gravity, static electricity, mechanics, air hydraulics, thermodynamics (heat), acoustics (sound), and inertia. This is a perfect refresher course for adults as well as an ideal introduction to science for youngsters.\"The experiments \u2026 are all clearly explained and unusually well illustrated.\" \u2014 Booklist.",

        "Description": "Now bigger, better, and with more guilt: a completely revised, updated, and expanded second edition (would it hurt to have a little more?) of Jewish as a Second Language, the hilarious field guide to Jewish language and culture. Written to help her Gentile husband and others like him who fall for believing a Jewish mother-in-law when she says, \"Don't bother driving me, I'll take a cab,\" Jewish as a Second Language shows how to be one of the family\u2014how to worry, how to interrupt, how to change your hotel room. It's not Yiddish. Though non-Jews can endear themselves by learning how to mis-use words like schmendrick and schmatta\u2014providing both laughs and confirmation of Jewish superiority\u2014this Jewish language is about the complex twists and somersaults of everyday speech, of unexpected nuances, hidden meanings, and swampy thickets of behavior, of wins, losses, and draws in competitions you never knew you entered. It's about the most common OAQs (obsessive anal questions): \"This mole looks okay, doesn't it?\" \"Can Saltines go bad?\" \"They'll de-ice the wings before takeoff, right?\" The Four Basic Shrugs. Acronyms never to use again: NASCAR, STD, and MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, the potentially deadly skin virus that\u2019s spread by contact, and also by talking about it casually). The things non-Jews do for fun and what Jews do: Contra dance/Contradict, Read the comics/Read the obituaries, Get your boobs done/Get your taxes done. Stuff never found in a Jewish home (trout flies, a lineoleum knife, a Lay-Z-Boy, a rottweiler) or mouth (Miracle Whip, marshmallow fluff, Bud).So you'll sit, you'll read, you'll laugh until you're nauseous.

It should have been obvious to the lay leaders of the Episcopal Church that an unorthodox and troubled man like Thomas Lewis Buckford was not the right choice for pastor of Trinity Church.Tom Buckford is a man in spiritual bankruptcy. His marriage is an empty shell. The wealth and snobbery of his new parish make a mockery of his ideals, and despair has blotted out his love of God. Then Tom meets Elizabeth McEwen and sets out on a course of disaster. Tom and Elizabeth fall in love with the famished hunger of long deprivation. But this forbidden love affair soon leaps beyond the bounds of physical passion to become a consuming spiritual awakening.Just as she did in A Book of Angels, Sophy Burnham has created a magnificent portrait of the mystery, the wonder, and the searing beauty of spiritual experience. Filled with stunning insight and riveting drama, Revelations is ultimately a story of confrontation between God's will and man's, between good and evil, between the material and the spiritual, between human laws and transcendent love.",

        "Description": "In October 1991, three weather systems collided off the coast of Nova Scotia to create a storm of singular fury, boasting waves over one hundred feet high. Among its victims was the Gloucester, Massachusetts-based swordfishing boat the Andrea Gail, which vanished with all six crew members aboard.\"Drifting down on swimmers is standard rescue procedure, but the seas are so violent that Buschor keeps getting flung out of reach. There are times when he's thirty feet higher than the men trying to rescue him. . . . [I]f the boat's not going to Buschor, Buschor's going to have to go to it. SWIM! they scream over the rail. SWIM! Buschor rips off his gloves and hood and starts swimming for his life.\"It was the storm of the century, boasting waves over one hundred feet high a tempest created by so rare a combination of factors that meteorologists deemed it \"the perfect storm.\" When it struck in October 1991, there was virtually no warning. \"She's comin' on, boys, and she's comin' on strong,\" radioed Captain Billy Tyne of the Andrea Gail off the coast of Nova Scotia, and soon afterward the boat and its crew of six disappeared without a trace.In a book taut with the fury of the elements, Sebastian Junger takes us deep into the heart of the storm, depicting with vivid detail the courage, terror, and awe that surface in such a gale. Junger illuminates a world of swordfishermen consumed by the dangerous but lucrative trade of offshore fishing, \"a young man's game, a single man's game,\" and gives us a glimpse of their lives in the tough fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts; he recreates the last moments of the Andrea Gail crew and recounts the daring high-seas rescues that made heroes of some and victims of others; and he weaves together the history of the fishing industry, the science of storms, and the candid accounts of the people whose lives the storm touched, to produce a rich and informed narrative. The Perfect Storm is a real-life thriller that will leave readers with the taste of salt air on their tongues and a sense of terror of the deep.",

        "Description": "We were awash in money and spellbound by celebrity. We ogled at O. J., marveled over Monica, and sent the stock market soaring. It was a time of unprecedented wealth and possibility, it was a time of waste and squandered opportunities. In the Best of Times (yes, the title is ironic), Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Haynes Johnson looks back on the decade when Bill Clinton and Bill Gates ran the country--and the rest of us sat back and downloaded it all off the Internet. He opens with a tense, exciting amount of chess master's Gary Kasparov's match with Deep Blue--a defeat of man by machine emblematic of a decade in which, as Thoreau said, we became \"tools of [our] tools.\" He takes us through the work-obsessed halls of Microsoft, the lab that created Dolly the Sheep, and the Hollywood studios that operated on the mantra \"dumb and dumber.\" The book is full of fresh insights into the headlines of the decade: the avalanche of wealth that rewarded some and passed many by; the societal schisms that could be seen from the O. J. Simpson trials to Congress. With a sharp eye for the quote or detail that perfectly captures a moment in time, Johnson knows just how to tell this story. He serves up no-holds-barred portraits of the key players, for a sorrowful David Geffen, who assures us that movies will only get worse, to Monica Lewinsky as a monument to entitlement. What lies ahead? It's uncertain. We can only hope that Haynes Johnson is there to explain it to us when it happens. The Best of Times, the product of four years of interviews with America's leaders in politics, business, and science, is in the best tradition of timeless social history--a memorable portrait of the nation at a turning point.",

Yet many of us are barely aware that we're eating something that has been altered; food labels do not include information on ingredients that have been genetically modified, and the subject has received surprisingly little media coverage.Even as genetically engineered foods spread throughout America, most consumers abroad have refused to eat them. Opposition to genetically engineered food is now beginning to surface in the United States, where biotechnology is becoming a major issue for the new century.Eating in the Dark tells the story of how these new foods, most of which are engineered either to produce or to withstand heavy doses of pesticides, quietly entered America's food supply. Kathleen Hart explores the potential of this new technology to enhance nutrition and cut farmers' expenses. She also reveals the process by which regulatory agencies decided to allow the biotechnology industry to sell its products without first submitting them to thorough testing for possible long-term threats to consumer health and the environment.",

        "Title": "The New Rabbi: A Congregation Searches for Its Leader",
        "Authors": "By Fried, Stephen",
        "Description": "From award-winning journalist Stephen Fried comes a vividly intimate portrait of American Judaism today in which faith, family, and community are explored through the dramatic life of a landmark congregation as it seeks to replace its legendary retiring rabbi--and reinvent itself for the next generation. The New RabbiThe center of this compelling chronicle is Har Zion Temple on Philadelphia\u2019s Main Line, which for the last seventy-five years has been one of the largest and most influential congregations in America. For thirty years Rabbi Gerald Wolpe has been its spiritual leader, a brilliant sermonizer of wide renown--but now he has announced his retirement. It is the start of a remarkable nationwide search process largely unknown to the lay world--and of much more. For at this dramatic moment Wolpe agrees to give extraordinary access to Fried, inviting him--and the reader--into the intense personal and professional life of the clergy and the complex behind-the-scenes life of a major Conservative congregation. These riveting pages bring us a unique view of Judaism in practice: from Har Zion\u2019s strong-willed leaders and influential families to the young bar and bat mitzvahs just beginning their Jewish lives; from the three-days-a-year synagogue goers to the hard core of devout attendees. We are touched by their times of joy and times of grief, intrigued by congregational politics, moved by the search for faith. We witness the conflicts between generations about issues of belief, observance, and the pressures of secular life. We meet Wolpe\u2019s vigorous-minded ailing wife and his sons, one of whom has become a celebrity rabbi in Los Angeles. And we follow the author\u2019s own moving search for meaning as he reconnects with the religion of his youth. We also have a front-row seat at the usually clandestine process of choosing a new rabbi, as what was expected to be a simple one-year search for Rabbi Wolpe\u2019s successor extends to two years and then three. Dozens of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are rejected, a parade of prospects come to interview, the chosen successor changes his mind at the last minute, and a confrontation erupts between the synagogue and the New York\u2013based Conservative rabbis\u2019 \u201cunion\u201d that governs the process. As the time comes for Wolpe to depart, a venerated house of worship is being torn apart. And thrust onto the pulpit is Wolpe\u2019s young assistant, Rabbi Jacob Herber, in his first job out of rabbinical school, facing the nearly impossible situation of taking over despite being technically ineligible for the position--and finding himself on trial with the congregation and at odds with his mentor. Rich in anecdote and scenes of wonderful immediacy, this is a riveting book about the search for personal faith, about the tension between secular concerns and ancient tradition in affluent America, and about what Wolpe himself has called \u201cthe retail business of religion.\u201d Stephen Fried brings all these elements to vivid life with the passion and energy of a superbly gifted storyteller.",

        "Description": "In her palatial Pacific Heights mansion, above a city glittering in the night, Lara Ashford lies dead. A former beauty queen and the wife of a powerful ex-congressman, she was a woman who made mistakes - married to a man who made even more.Grace Harris and Barrett Dickson are the two attorneys caught in the fray, clinging to their careers, their troubled lives, their shaken ideals. The trial of Elliot Ashford for the brutal murder of his wife will turn them into adversaries in the courtroom, even as they find themselves dangerously close to each other outside it. For Grace, bent on justice no matter what the cost, the prosecution hinges on flawed and circumstantial evidence. For Barrett, a once-great advocate now on the fast track to oblivion, the defense hinges on an alibi that will not hold up.With a key piece of evidence mysteriously vanished...with the D.A. trying to run from his secrets all the way to the governor's mansion...and with influential people pulling strings on both sides, an innocent jury will be drawn into the cross fire, as a case driven by personal vendettas and hidden motives erupts in violence.Because - behind the headlines, the politics, and the legal maneuvering, behind the lies, the evasions, and the stunning reversals - another player is in the game: one with a front-row seat, and a history of madness and murder...",

And as Luke Lucas starts to unravel the mystery of his amnesia and relearn the story of his life, his desperate search leads him back to his Harvard friends: to his wife, to his best friend, to the woman he once loved more than life itself ... and to the realization that his fate is tied to the rocket that stands ready at the Cape. For Luke knew something that someone deliberately wanted him to forget, and unless he is able to discover his own terrible, deadly secret, Luke may be left powerless to save the launch of Explorer - and with it, America's future.",

The Republic is failing, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, elected ten years earlier to save the crumbling government. Separatists threaten war, and the Senate is hopelessly divided, unable to determine whether to raise an army for battle or keep the fragile peace. It is a stalemate that once broken, could lead to galactic chaos.Mischievous and resolved, courageous to the point of recklessness, Anakin Skywalker has come of age in a time of great upheaval. The nineteen-year-old apprentice to Obi-Wan Kenobi is an enigma to the Jedi Council, and a challenge to his Jedi Master. Time has not dulled Anakin\u2019s ambition, nor has his Jedi training tamed his independent streak. When an attempt on Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala\u2019s life brings them together for the first time in ten years, it is clear that time also has not dulled Anakin\u2019s intense feelings for the beautiful diplomat.The attack on Senator Amidala just before a crucial vote thrusts the Republic even closer to the edge of disaster. Masters Yoda and Mace Windu sense enormous unease. The dark side is growing, clouding the Jedi\u2019s perception of the events.

Now, in a work filled with truth, surprises, and humor, renowned psychologist and author Martha Manning offers mothers and daughters of all ages a new way to understand each other. Challenging the accepted premise that this powerful bond must be severed for emotional growth, Manning shows us why this precious attachment is never outgrown, how, if it is damaged, it can be healed, and what will enrich this lifelong commitment while fostering essential independence. The key is empathy, and Manning provides potent tools to help us build stronger ties and celebrate the crazy twists, joys, and secrets inherent in this most glorious of life connections.Combining personal experiences and scrupulous research, The Common Thread helps each of us develop a mutually empowering relationship -- and laugh, too -- as we more deeply connect with and appreciate the mother or daughter we love.",

Like the inspirations for Robert Fulghum\u2032s All I Really Need to Know I learned in Kindergarten, Cherie Carter-Scott\u2032s If Life Is a Game, These are the Rules, and Margaret Fishback Power\u2032s Footprints, the poem that sparked The Invitation has been embraced around the world, passed along by thousands who have discovered and treasured its message. In this lovely gift book the author speaks from the heart, reflecting on everything from desire to betrayal and offering practical - and often surprising - suggestions for how to live the ecstasy of everyday life, learn to recognise true beauty in ourselves and the world around us, and how to find the sustenance that our spirit longs for. The poem Invitation has been recited and quoted at countless spiritual conferences, and on network radio by Robert Bly, Jack Kornfield, Angeles Arrien, and many other spiritual leaders. From the Invitation: \u0234 doesn\u2032t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart\u2032s longing. It doesn\u2032t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive ...\u2032",

        "Authors": "By Weigel, George",
        "Description": "The Catholic Church in America is in a state of crisis. Yet few understand what the crisis really is, why it happened, or how the Church must respond to it. As no other commentator or critic has done, George Weigel situates the current crisis of sexual abuse and episcopal malfeasance in the context of recent Catholic history. With honesty and critical rigor, he reveals the Church's failure to embrace the true spiritual promise of Vatican II, a failure that has resulted in the gradual but steady surrender to liberal culture that he dubs \"Catholic Lite.\" Drawing upon his unparalleled knowledge of how the Church works, both in America and in Rome, Weigel exposes the patterns of dissent and self-deception that became entrenched in seminaries, among priests, and ultimately among the bishops who failed their flock by thinking like managers instead of apostles. But, Weigel reminds us, in the Biblical world a \"crisis\" is a time of great opportunity, an invitation to deeper faith. Every great crisis of the Church's past, from the Dark Ages to the Reformation, has resulted in a period of reform that returned the Church-and its priesthood-to its roots. Weigel sets forth an agenda for genuine reform that challenges seminarians, priests, bishops, and the laity to lead more integrally Catholic lives. As he argues so persuasively, the answer to the present crisis will not be found in \"Catholic Lite\" but in classic Catholicism: a Catholicism that has reclaimed the wisdom of the past in order to face the corruptions of the present and create a strong future.",

Holding Novak in a near impenetrable fortress, The Caliph has refused to negotiate for his release, planning instead to brutally execute Novak in a matter of days.Running out of time and hope, Novak's people turn to a man with a long history of defeating impossible odds: Paul Janson.  For decades, Janson was an operative and assassin whose skills and exploits made him a legend in the notorious U.S. covert agency Consular Operatations. No longer able to live with the brutality, bloodshed, and personal loss that marked his career, Janson has retired from the field and nothing could lure him back.  Nothing except Peter Novak, a man who once saved Janson's life when everyone else was powerless to help.With the considerable resources of The Liberty Foundation at his disposal, Janson hastily assembles a crack extraction team, setting in motion an ingenious rescue operation. But the operation goes horribly wrong and Janson is marked for death, the target of a \"beyond salvage\" order issued from the highest level of the government. Now he is running for his life, pursued by Jessica Kincaid, a young agent of astonishing ability who - as a student of Janson's own lethal arsenal of tactics and techniques - can anticipate and counter his every move.  To survive, Janson must outrace a conspiracy that has gone beyond the control of its originators. To win, he must counter it with a conspiracy of his own.With mere days, perhaps only hours, remaining, and shadowed by a secret that links Janson's violent life with that of the visionary peacemaker Peter Novak, Janson's only hope is to uncover the nearly unimaginable truth behind these events - a truth that has the power to foment wars, topple governments, and change the very course of history.",
