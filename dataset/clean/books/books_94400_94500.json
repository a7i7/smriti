        "Title": "The Oxford Book of American Detective Stories",
        "Authors": "By Herbert, Rosemary (EDT) and Hillerman, Tony (EDT)",
        "Description": "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" launched the detective story in 1841. The genre began as a highbrow form of entertainment, a puzzle to be solved by a rational sifting of clues. In Britain, the stories became decidedly upper crust: the crime often committed in a world of manor homes and formal gardens, the blood on the Persian carpet usually blue. But from the beginning, American writers worked important changes on Poe's basic formula, especially in use of language and locale. As early as 1917, Susan Glaspell evinced a poignant understanding of motive in a murder in an isolated farmhouse. And with World War I, the Roaring '20s, the rise of organized crime and corrupt police with Prohibition, and the Great Depression, American detective fiction branched out in all directions, led by writers such as Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, who brought crime out of the drawing room and into the \"mean streets\" where it actually occurred.      In The Oxford Book of American Detective Stories, Tony Hillerman and Rosemary Herbert bring together thirty-three tales that illuminate both the evolution of crime fiction in the United States and America's unique contribution to this highly popular genre. Tracing its progress from elegant \"locked room\" mysteries, to the hard-boiled realism of the '30s and '40s, to the great range of styles seen today, this superb collection includes the finest crime writers, including Erle Stanley Gardner, Raymond Chandler, Ross Macdonald, Rex Stout, Ellery Queen, Ed McBain, Sue Grafton, and Hillerman himself. There are also many delightful surprises: Bret Harte, for instance, offers a Sherlockian pastiche with a hero named Hemlock Jones, and William Faulkner blends local color, authentic dialogue, and dark, twisted pride in \"An Error in Chemistry.\" We meet a wide range of sleuths, from armchair detective Nero Wolfe, to Richard Sale's journalist Daffy Dill, to Robert Leslie Bellem's wise-cracking Hollywood detective Dan Turner, to Linda Barnes's six-foot tall, red-haired, taxi-driving female P.I., Carlotta Carlyle. And we sample a wide variety of styles, from tales with a strongly regional flavor, to hard-edged pulp fiction, to stories with a feminist perspective. Perhaps most important, the book offers a brilliant summation of America's signal contribution to crime fiction, highlighting the myriad ways in which we have reshaped this genre. The editors show how Raymond Chandler used crime, not as a puzzle to be solved, but as a spotlight with which he could illuminate the human condition; how Ed McBain, in \"A Small Homicide,\" reveals a keen knowledge of police work as well as of the human sorrow which so often motivates crime; and how Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer solved crime not through blood stains and footprints, but through psychological insight into the damaged lives of the victim's family. And throughout, the editors provide highly knowledgeable introductions to each piece, written from the perspective of fellow writers and reflecting a life-long interest--not to say love--of this quintessentially American genre.     American crime fiction is as varied and as democratic as America itself. Hillerman and Herbert bring us a gold mine of glorious stories that can be read for sheer pleasure, but that also illuminate how the crime story evolved from the drawing room to the back alley, and how it came to explore every corner of our nation and every facet of our lives.",

        "Description": "While Laura Ingraham was walking through a Northern Virginia shopping mall one Saturday afternoon, it all became clear to her. Everywhere she turned, she saw signs of the impending disaster: zombie teens texting each other across a caf\u00e9 table; a man having his eyebrows threaded at a kiosk; a fiftyish woman shoe-horned into a tube top and skinny jeans; and a storefront ad featuring a Victoria\u2019s Secret model spilling out of her push-up bra and into the faces of young passersby. Ingraham wondered to herself, \u201cIs this it? Is this what our forefathers fought for? What my parents struggled for? I wonder if Victoria\u2019s Secret is still having that two-for-one sale?\u201d A menacing force surrounds us. We see it, we feel it, we know it. The country we love is in grave peril. While politicians and \u201cexperts\u201d prattle on about the debt crisis at home, and terrorism abroad, a more insidious homegrown threat is emerging. It endangers our future and undermines our present. The uncomfortable truth is: We have become our own worst enemy. The culture we have created is now turning on us. We\u2019re on the verge of drowning in our ignorance, arrogance, gluttony . . . can you believe there are only three shots of vanilla in a Caramel Macchiato?!? Now in an act of patriotic intervention the most-listened-to woman in talk radio casts her satirical eye upon all that ails American society. In this sharp-witted, comic romp, Laura Ingraham takes you on a guided tour through ten levels of our cultural hell. You know we\u2019re in trouble when . . . \u2022 Airplane seats shrink\u2014just as the passengers expand. \u2022 Celebrity baby names go from the peculiar (Apple, Stetson, and Daisy Boo) to the pathetic (Bamboo, Blanket, and Bronx). \u2022 People meticulously tend their virtual crops on Farmville, while their children eat takeout. \u2022 \u201cBreaking News\u201d usually means it happened yesterday. \u2022 The weddings last longer than the marriages. \u2022 Facebook has become a verb and reading has become an ancient art form. Of Thee I Zing is cultural commentary too funny to ignore, igniting a national conversation long past due. America, your cultural recovery begins here.",

        "Description": "After a self-assured John F. Kennedy bested a visibly shaky Richard Nixon in their famous 1960 debates, political television, it was said, would henceforth determine elections. Today, many claim the Internet will be the latest medium to revolutionize electoral politics. Candidates invest heavily in web and email campaigns to reach prospective voters, as well as to communicate with journalists, potential donors, and political activists. Do these efforts influence voters, expand democracy, increase the coverage of political issues, or mobilize a shrinking and apathetic electorate?Campaigning Online answers these questions by looking at how candidates present themselves online and how voters respond to their efforts-including whether voters learn from candidates' websites and whether voters' views are affected by what they see. Although the Internet will not lead to a revolution in democracy, it will, Bimber and Davis argue, have consequences: reinforcing messages, mobilizing activists, and strengthening partisans' views. Reporting on a wealth of new data drawn from national and state-wide surveys, laboratory experiments, interviews with campaign staff, and analysis of web sites themselves, Campaigning Online draws the most complete picture of the role of campaign websites in American elections to date.",

Or a heart that longs for more, whatever the cost.  .  .Sir Michael Bayard found more than he expected in his bed when he finally joined his new mistress. He'd fantasized about her dewy skin and luscious curves, assured her understanding that what passed between them was mere dalliance. But he didn't expect the innocence and heat of her response in his arms.

Nor can an honest passion burn away the restraints of society's judgments. Unless, of course, one believes in nonsense like true love.  .  .",

Then there\u2019s Norma Rae, the turkey rescued from a &#147;turkey bowl\u201d just before Thanksgiving. There\u2019s also Noah, a twenty-one-year-old stallion, starved and locked in a dark stall for his entire life until he came to the safety and plenty of CAS. Claude, the giant pink free-range pig, is but another of the &#147;underfoot family,\u201d those who roam the barnyard, free and with dignity, interacting with their own and other species in startling and profound ways. The love Stevens has for these animals, and the amount of love they give her in return, is stunning and will make any reader more thoughtful of how we treat a whole class of animals in this country. Pigs, cows, chickens, turkeys, horses, goats, sheep, and more, march into CAS and into our hearts as we learn about their quirks and personalities and what makes us human.",

Though today few people join churches based on doctrinal commitments, once a person has joined a church it becomes important to know the historic teachings of that church's tradition. In Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials, Ted Campbell outlines historical doctrinal consensus in American Episcopal Methodist Churches in a comparative and ecumenical dialogue with the doctrinal inheritance of other major families of Christian tradition. In this way, the book shows both what Methodist churches historically teach in common with ecumenical Christianity and what is distinctive about the Methodist tradition in its various contemporary forms. Documents examined include The Twenty-Five Articles of Religion, The General Rules, Wesley's Standard Sermons and Explanatory Notes upon the New Testament, The Methodist Social Creed, and the Apostles' Creed.",

His mother abandoned him to the state childcare system and he was sent to a bleak orphanage called Baby House 10. Once there, he entered a nightmare world he was not to leave for more than eight years. Housed in a ward with a group of other children, he was clothed in rags, ignored by most of the staff and given little, if any, medical treatment. He was finally, and cruelly, confined for a time to a mental asylum where he lived, almost caged, lying in a pool of his own waste on a locked ward surrounded by psychotic adults. But, that didn\u2019t stop Vanya. Even in these harsh conditions, he grew into a smart and persistent young boy who reached out to everyone around him. Two of those he reached out to\u2014Sarah Philps, the wife of a British journalist, and Vika, a young Russian woman\u2014realized that Vanya was no ordinary child and they began a campaign to find him a home. After many twists and turns, Vanya came to the attention of a single woman living in the United States named Paula Lahutsky. After a lot of red tape and more than one miracle, Paula adopted Vanya and brought him to the U.S. where he is now known as John Lahutsky, an honors student at Freedom High School in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and a member of the Boy Scouts of America Order of the Arrow.  In The Boy From Baby House 10, Sarah\u2019s hus band, Alan Philps, helps John Lahutsky bring this inspiring true-life story of a small boy with a big heart and an unquenchable will to readers everywhere.",

In his giant New York Times bestseller, America Alone: The End of the World as We Know It, Mark Steyn predicted collapse for the rest of the Western World. Now, he adds, America has caught up with Europe on the great rush to self-destruction. It\u2019s not just our looming financial collapse; it\u2019s not just a culture that seems on a fast track to perdition, full of hapless, indulgent, childish people who think government has the answer for every problem; it\u2019s not just America\u2019s potential eclipse as a world power because of the drunken sailor policymaking in Washington\u2014no, it\u2019s all this and more that spells one word for America: Armageddon. What will a world without American leadership look like? It won\u2019t be pretty\u2014not for you and not for your children. America\u2019s decline won\u2019t be gradual, like an aging Europe sipping espresso at a caf\u00e9 until extinction (and the odd Greek or Islamist riot). No, America\u2019s decline will be a wrenching affair marked by violence and possibly secession. With his trademark wit, Steyn delivers the depressing news with raw and unblinking honesty\u2014but also with the touch of vaudeville stand-up and soft shoe that makes him the most entertaining, yet profound, columnist on the planet.

And Mark Steyn says that this collection is \u201ca virtuoso display.\u201dIn these pages, Nordlinger visits unusual towns, universities\u2013even music camps. He delves into politics, then profiles a number of personalities: George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Naguib Mahfouz, Al Sharpton, Donald Rumsfeld, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Rodney Dangerfield\u2026. He sends dispatches from Europe\u2013East and West\u2013and the Middle East. He writes on a favorite sport, golf, and a favorite art: music. We meet Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Luciano Pavarotti, Meredith Wilson (the composer of The Music Man), and many others.The book closes with a selection of personal pieces, involving matters large and small. What we have here is a feast of a book, served in several appetizing courses. Mark Helprin says that reading these pieces is \u201clike opening one present after another.\u201d Rush Limbaugh says that the book is \u201cwitty, grabbing, and fun.\u201dAnd, out the author, Norman Podhoretz says, \u201cThe easy informality of his style never fails to engage and delight, the wide-ranging cultivation it reflects never fails to enlighten, and the energy that propels it never fails to amaze.\u201d Readers are invited to experience this for themselves.",

These are people who are alternately amazed, appalled, delighted, depressed, illuminated, disturbed, or simply thrown by their first days, weeks, and months of sobriety. Kettelhack explores the challenges all seem to face: learning to break through loneliness, isolation, and fear; finding ways to deal with anger, depression, and resentment; and learning how to deal with a new and sometimes overwhelming happiness.Guy Kettelhack has written seven books on recovery. He is completing a Master's degree in psychoanalysis, and is an analyst-in-training at the Boston and New York Centers for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies.

Born in England during the First Word War, Sophie Marks has never known her mother or father. Her bohemian grandparents introduce her to the world of art - but her studies in London teach her that creativity alone cannot sustain a rewarding life.After the Second World War sews its desperation and unimaginable loss, Sophie flees to Paris where a new life awaits. As her painting blossoms, a possibility for happiness appears in the form of Luca Bondi, a talented Italian sculptor. But when their relationship begins to crumble after years of artistic and romantic fulfillment, she realizes she must once again take flight and invent a new destiny for herself. In a journey that takes Sophie to the American Southwest, critical acclaim and retrospectives in leading museums elevate her stature over the next two decades. She does not realize how isolated she has become, how far she has drifted from that magical intersection until she is visited by someone from her former life seeking comfort and direction. With this person's help she decides to return to Europe, to confront the hidden memories of her childhood in England and to test the possibilities of renewed love, a passion ripened by maturity.",
