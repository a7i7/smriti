No, not your purse, or a diaper bag, or your child's lunch box, but one created in your mind.  And you didn't stuff it with books, band-aids, or baby food-you filled it with burdens.  The kind of burdens moms carry.The suitcase of guilt.  A sack of discontent.  You drape a duffel bag of weariness on one shoulder and a hanging bag of worry on the other.No wonder you're so tired at the end of the day.  Toting those kind of bags is exhausting.Why don't you try traveling light?  Try it for the sake of those you love so dearly: your husband, your children, your parents.  Have you ever considered the impact that excess baggage has on relationships?God wants to use you, you know.  But how can he if you're exhausted?Using the comforting message of the twenty-third Psalm, Max Lucado reminds mothers to listen to God's tender voice urging us to release those burdens we were never meant to bear.",

Working with the nonprofit conservation organization, Defenders of Wildlife, Bergman focuses here on the Mexican delta of the Colorado River.  Transformed from a fertile area to a dry wasteland as a result of the U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty of 1944, the region has recently gained the attention of environmental groups. The text describes how the current situation came to be, and encourages revision of the binational agreement allocating the river's waters, in order to reduce the negative ecological, economic, and cultural impacts on Mexico.

        "Authors": "By McMurtry, Larry",
        "Description": "From the early 1800s to the end of his life in 1917, Buffalo Bill Cody was as famous as anyone could be. Annie Oakley was his most celebrated prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, the 'slip of a girl' from Ohio who could (and did) outshoot anybody to become the most celebrated star of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.   In this sweeping dual biography, Larry McMurtry explores the lives, the legends and above all the truth about two larger-than-life American figures. With his Wild West show, Buffalo Bill helped invent the image of the West that still exists today -- cowboys and Indians, rodeo, rough rides, sheriffs and outlaws, trick shooting, Stetsons, and buckskin. The short, slight Annie Oakley -- born Phoebe Ann Moses -- spent sixteen years with Buffalo Bill's Wild West, where she entertained Queen Victoria, Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and Kaiser Wilhelm II, among others. Beloved by all who knew her, including Hunkpapa leader, Sitting Bull, Oakley became a legend in her own right and after her death, achieved a new lease of fame in Irving Berlin's musical Annie, Get Your Gun.   To each other, they were always 'Missie' and 'Colonel'. To the rest of the world, they were cultural icons, setting the path for all that followed. Larry McMurtry -- a writer who understands the West better than any other -- recreates their astonishing careers and curious friendship in a fascinating history that reads like the very best of his fiction.",

        "Title": "Sailing Alone Around the Room: New and Selected Poems",
        "Authors": "By Collins, Billy",
        "Description": "\"High, most encouraging tidings\"--that is how Billy Collins, the widely read and widely acclaimed poet, describes the music in his poem about the gospel singing group The Sensational Nightingales. The same phrase applies, just as joyfully, to the arrival of Sailing Alone Around the Room, a landmark collection of new and selected poems by this Guggenheim Fellow, NPR contributor, New York Public Library \"Literary Lion,\" and incomparably popular performer of his own good works.  From four earlier collections, which have secured for him a national reputation, Collins offers the lyric equivalent of an album of Greatest Hits. In \"Forgetful-ness,\" memories of the contents of a novel \"retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain,  to a little fishing village where there are no phones.\" In \"Osso Buco,\" a poem about gustatory pleasure, the \"lion of content-ment\" places a warm heavy paw on the poet's chest. In \"Marginalia,\" he catalogs the scrawled comments of books' previous readers: \" 'Absolutely,' they shout to Duns Scotus and James Baldwin.  'Yes.' 'Bull's-eye.'  'My man!' \" And he also serves us a generous portion of new poems, including \"Man Listening to Disc,\" a jazz trip with headphones, and \"The Iron Bridge,\" a wildly speculative, moving elegy.Whether old or new, these poems will catch their readers by exhilarating surprise. They may begin with irony and end in lyric transcendence. They may open with humor and close with grief. They may, and often do, begin with the everyday and end with infinity. Wise, funny, sad, stealthy, and always perfectly clear, these poems will not be departing for that little fishing village with no phones for a long, long time. Billy Collins, possessed of a unique lyric voice, is one of American poetry's most sensational nightingales.",

        "Authors": "By Marks, Frederick W.",
        "Description": "No president in American history has suffered a stranger fate at the hands of posterity than Theodore Roosevelt. The world leader who achieved international recognition and popularity in his own time as a man of peace (he was one of only two presidents awarded the Nobel Peace Prize) is submerged in the image of the Rough Rider, the \u201cBully\u201d fighter, whose enthusiasm for a fight or a hunt was unrestrained by humanitarian or other concerns. The kindest criticism of Roosevelt holds that by good luck and good advice he was able to avoid disaster; the unkindest that he was an international adventurer who posturing misled may an admirer. Moreover, the apparent paradox implicit in his famous slogan, \u201cSpeak softly and carry a big stick,\u201d has confused scholar and layman alike, and that confusion has been abetted by the seemingly contradictory impulses of his personality.Frederick W. Marks III, drawing upon archival and manuscript materials in five countries, as well as numerous primary and secondary sources, rebuts, point by pint, the myths and misconceptions that have given rise to this distorted and confused image. Arguing that Roosevelt can be understood only in the context of his time and that the whole of his diplomatic record provides the key to understanding its individual parts, he reconstructs in careful detail the man, his time, and his record, and, in so doing, allows us to see Theodore Roosevelt whole.Given the received opinion concerning the man and his presidency and the nature of contemporary political attitudes, Mark\u2019s interpretation of Roosevelt\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs will undoubtedly prove highly controversial, yet his argument, buttressed as it is by a wealth of source material, deserves serious consideration by those concerned not only with the accuracy of historical judgment but also with the successful conduct of foreign relations.",

        "Description": "The Shift\u2014a companion book to the movie of the same name\u2014illustrates how and why to make the move from ambition to meaning. Such a shift eliminates our feelings of separateness, illuminates our spiritual connectedness, and involves moving from the ego-directed morning into the afternoon of life where everything is primarily influenced by purpose.As we contemplate leaving the morning of our life, where ego has played a commanding role, and entering the afternoon (and evening), where meaning and purpose replace ambition and struggle, we may encounter unexpected occurrences that accompany this new direction. It\u2019s almost a universal law that we\u2019ll experience a fall of some kind. Yet these falls or low points provide the energy we need to move away from ego and into a life of meaning and purpose.The Shift doesn\u2019t mean that we lose our drive and ambition; it signifies that we become ambitious about something new. We make a commitment to living a life based on experiencing meaning and feeling purposeful, rather than never-ending demands and false promises that are the trademark of the ego\u2019s agenda.As Dr. Wayne W. Dyer so eloquently reveals in these pages, we all have the choice to shift our lives from ambition to meaning . . . and thereby complete our return to the Source that created us.",

        "Authors": "By James, Henry",
        "Description": "Widely recognized as one of literature's most gripping ghost stories, this classic tale of moral degradation concerns the sinister transformation of two innocent children into flagrant liars and hypocrites. The story begins when a governess arrives at an English country estate to look after Miles, aged ten, and Flora, eight. At first, everything appears normal but then events gradually begin to weave a spell of psychological terror.One night a ghost appears before the governess. It is the dead lover of Miss Jessel, the former governess. Later, the ghost of Miss Jessel herself appears before the governess and the little girl. Moreover, both the governess and the housekeeper suspect that the two spirits have appeared to the boy in private. The children, however, adamantly refuse to acknowledge the presence of the two spirits, in spite of indications that there is some sort of evil communication going on between the children and the ghosts.Without resorting to clattering chains, demonic noises, and other melodramatic techniques, this elegantly told tale succeeds in creating an atmosphere of tingling suspense and unspoken horror matched by few other books in the genre. Known for his probing psychological novels dealing with the upper classes, James in this story tried his hand at the occult \u2014 and created a masterpiece of the supernatural that has frightened and delighted readers for nearly a century.",

It takes the form of an anonymous high school science teacher\u2019s journal about an unpublished novel written by his deceased lover, a young woman named Julia Marquezim Enone. Her novel\u2019s central character, Maria da Franca, is a destitute and mentally unstable woman at odds with the Brazilian social welfare system, from which she is trying to claim benefits for time spent in a psychiatric hospital. The journal represents the science teacher\u2019s attempt to understand Julia\u2019s novel and, in the process, Julia herself and the relationship they once shared. Rather than providing him with comfort and a better understanding of his beloved, the teacher\u2019s explorations create an ever-widening circle of questions and fears about himself, her, and finally any attempt to understand anything about anyone. But the narrator\u2019s failures become the reader\u2019s comic delights. Reminiscent of Flann O\u2019Brien, Manuel Puig, and Laurence Sterne, with this novel Osman Lins takes his rightful place among the major figures of twentieth-century fiction.",

The Devil's Punchbowl reveals a world of depravity, sex, violence, and the corruption of a Southern town.As a prosecuting attorney in Houston, Penn Cage sent hardened killers to death row. But it is as mayor of his hometown -- Natchez, Mississippi -- that Penn will face his most dangerous threat. Urged by old friends to try to restore this fading jewel of the Old South, Penn has ridden into office on a tide of support for change. But in its quest for new jobs and fresh money, Natchez, like other Mississippi towns, has turned to casino gambling, and now five fantastical steamboats float on the river beside the old slave market at Natchez like props from Gone With the Wind.But one boat isn't like the others.Rumor has it that the Magnolia Queen has found a way to pull the big players from Las Vegas to its Mississippi backwater. And with them -- on sleek private jets that slip in and out of town like whispers in the night -- come pro football players, rap stars, and international gamblers, all sharing an unquenchable taste for one thing: blood sport -- and the dark vices that go with it. When a childhood friend of Penn's who brings him evidence of these crimes is brutally murdered, the full weight of Penn's failure to protect his city hits home. So begins his quest to find the men responsible. But it's a hunt he begins alone, for the local authorities have been corrupted by the money and power of his hidden enemy. With his family's lives at stake, Penn realizes his only allies in his one-man war are those bound to him by blood or honor:Caitlin Masters, the lover Penn found in The Quiet Can Game and lost in Turning AngelDanny McDavitt, the heroic helicopter pilot from Third DegreeTom Cage, Penn's father and legendary local family physicianWalt Garrity, a retired Texas Ranger who served with Penn's father during the Korean WarTogether they must defeat a sophisticated killer who has an almost preternatural ability to anticipate -- and counter -- their every move. Ultimately, victory will depend on a bold stroke that will leave one of Penn's allies dead -- and Natchez changed forever.After appearing in two of Iles's most popular novels, Penn Cage makes his triumphant return as a brilliant, honorable, and courageous hero. Rich with Southern atmosphere and marked by one jaw-dropping plot turn after another, The Devil's Punchbowl confirms that Greg Iles is America's master of suspense.",

        "Description": "An inspiring legal thriller set against the backdrop of the war on terror, The Challenge tells the inside story of a historic Supreme Court showdown. At its center are a Navy JAG and a young constitutional law professor who, in the aftermath of 9/11, find themselves defending their nation in the unlikeliest of ways: by suing the president of the United States on behalf of an accused terrorist in order to prevent the American government from breaking the law and violating the Constitution.\u00a0\u00a0Jonathan Mahler traces the journey of their client, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, from the Yemeni mosque where he was first recruited for jihad in 1998, through his years working as a driver for Osama bin Laden, to his capture in Afghanistan in November 2001 and his subsequent transfer to Guantanamo Bay. It was there that Hamdan was designated by President Bush to be tried before a special military tribunal and assigned a military lawyer to represent him, a thirty-five-year-old graduate student of the Naval Academy, Lieutenant Commander Charles Swift. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No one expected Swift to mount much of a defense. Not only were the rules of the tribunals, America\u2019s first in more than fifty years, stacked against him, his superiors at the Pentagon were pressuring him to persuade Hamdan to plead guilty. But Swift didn\u2019t believe that the tribunals were either legal or fair, so he enlisted a young Georgetown law professor named Neal Katyal to help him sue the Bush administration over their legality. In the spring of 2006, Katyal, who had almost no trial experience, took the case to the Supreme Court and won. The landmark ruling has been called the Court\u2019s most important decision ever on presidential power and the rule of law.\u00a0 Written with the\u00a0cooperation of Swift and Katyal, The Challenge follows the braided stories of Swift\u2019s intense, precarious relationship with Hamdan and the unprecedented legal case itself. Combining rich character portraits and courtroom drama reminiscent of Jonathan Harr\u2019s A Civil Action with sophisticated yet accessible legal analysis, The Challenge is a riveting narrative that illuminates some of the most pressing constitutional questions of the post-9/11 era.",

        "Title": "Hope in Hell: Inside the World of Doctors Without Borders",
        "Authors": "By Bortolotti, Dan",
        "Description": "Gripping accounts of medical workers who volunteer to serve in some of the world's most dangerous hotspots.    The humanitarian organization, Doctors Without Borders, (also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or MSF) delivers emergency aid to victims of armed conflict, epidemics, natural disasters and those who lack reliable health care. Each year, more than 2,500 volunteer doctors, nurses, and other professionals join locally-hired staff to provide medical aid in more than eighty countries.    At the forefront are the volunteer doctors who risk their lives to perform surgery, establish or rehabilitate hospitals and clinics, run nutrition and sanitation programs, and train local medical personnel. This book follows these volunteer doctors as they risk their health and lives to treat patients in desperate need.    Combining engaging text with dramatic color photographs from around            the world, Hope in Hell examines the lives of individual MSF volunteer medical professionals.    Topics include:  Performing emergency surgery in the war torn regions of Africa and Asia  Understanding cultural customs and societal differences that affect health care  Witnessing and reporting genocidal atrocities.    Also, the most recent world events are explored and how MSF is reacting to them. These include the challenges of delivering aid during the Rwandan massacre and the controversial decision to criticize the U.S. for delivering humanitarian aid to Afghan citizens while at war.    The book also covers the raucous founding of Doctors Without Borders in 1971 as the first non-governmental organization to both provide emergency medical assistance and publicly bear witness to the plight of the populations they             served. In 1999, the organization was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.    Hope in Hell is a fascinating and often harrowing account of the men and women who struggle to improve the lives of people in desperate need.",
