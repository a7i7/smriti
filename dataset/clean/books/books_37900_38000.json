        "Description": "\u201cFascinating . . . Alison Weir does full justice to the subject.\u201d\u2014The Philadelphia InquirerAt his death in 1547, King Henry VIII left four heirs to the English throne: his only son, the nine-year-old Prince Edward; the Lady Mary, the adult daughter of his first wife Katherine of Aragon; the Lady Elizabeth, the teenage daughter of his second wife Anne Boleyn; and his young great-niece, the Lady Jane Grey. In this riveting account Alison Weir paints a unique portrait of these extraordinary rulers, examining their intricate relationships to each other and to history. She traces the tumult that followed Henry's death, from the brief intrigue-filled reigns of the boy king Edward VI and the fragile Lady Jane Grey, to the savagery of \"Bloody Mary,\" and finally the accession of the politically adroit Elizabeth I.As always, Weir offers a fresh perspective on a period that has spawned many of the most enduring myths in English history, combining the best of the historian's and the biographer's art.\u201cLike anthropology, history and biography can demonstrate unfamiliar ways of feeling and being. Alison Weir's sympathetic collective biography, The Children of Henry VIII does just that, reminding us that human nature has changed--and for the better. . . . Weir imparts movement and coherence while re-creating the suspense her characters endured and the suffering they inflicted.\u201d\u2014The New York Times Book Review",

In the climate of self-improvement that has reigned for the last twenty years, misinformation about treatments for everything from alcohol abuse to sexual dysfunction has flourished. Those of us trying to change these conditions often experience the frustration of failure, mixed success, or success followed by a relapse. But have you ever asked yourself: can my condition really be changed? And if so, am I going about it in the most effective way?In this meticulously researched book, Martin Seligman, distinguished psychologist and bestselling author of LEARNED OPTIMISM, helps us realize clearly and realistically exactly what we can change and what we can't. Grounding his conclusions in the most recent and most authoritative scientific studies, Seligman pinpoints the techniques and therapies that work best for each condition, explains why they work, and discusses how you can use them to change your life. Inside, you'll discover:* The four natural healing factors for recovering from alcoholism* The vital difference between overeating and being overweight, and why dieters always gain back the pounds they \"lost\"* The four therapies that work for depression, and how you can \"dispute\" your way to optimistic thinking* The pros and cons of anger, and the steps to take to understand it* And much more!",

Marita Golden was raised in Washington, D.C., by a mother who was a cleaning woman and a father who was taxi-driver. For all their struggles, with life and each other, her parents instilled her with spirit and aspirations. Swept up in the heady Black Power movement of the sixties, Marita moved to New York to study journalism at Columbia--and fell in love with Femi Ajayi, a Nigerian architecture student.. Their passion led them to start a life together in Africa--a place Marita was eager to  understand. Exhilarated by a world free of white racism, Marita quickly found work as a professor and embraced motherhood. But Femi's increasing expectations that she snap into the role of the submissive Nigerian wife were shocking and dispiriting. Her struggle to regain her footing and shape a black identity that was true to her spirit is suspenseful and inspiring, an uncommon tale of race, identity, and Africa.",

This beguiling account of Irish life transcends that nation's small shores through the power of Mahoney's great storytelling gifts.Before the phenomena of Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes, and Thomas Cahill's How the Irish Saved Civilization, Rosemary Mahoney traveled to Ireland in response to the growing feeling that changes were taking place, and that those changes directly involved women. Her ideas are animated in brilliantly crafted scenes, taking the reader from Dillon's tiny pub in Corofin to a lesbian pub in Dublin, from a Legion of Mary meeting to a classroom full of boisterous schoolgirls determined to drive their teacher, S'ta Keatin', over the edge. Here, too, are scenes with Ireland's first woman president, Mary Robinson, and the country's preeminent woman poet, Eavan Boland. But most memorable, and perhaps most prescient of the recent enchantment with literature about the Emerald Isle, are Mahoney's pitch-perfect ear for Irish bluster and warmth, her eye for detail, and people so real and unforgettable you'd think they were having a cup of tea with you.",

        "Description": "For the first time in our history, scientists are uncovering astounding medical evidence about dieting -- and why so many of us struggle with our weight and the size of our waists. Now researchers are unraveling biological secrets about such things as why you crave chocolate or gorge at buffets or store so much fat.Michael Roizen and Mehmet Oz, America's most trusted doctor team and authors of the bestselling YOU series, are now translating this cutting-edge information to help you shave inches off your waist. They're going to do it by giving you the best weapon against fat: knowledge. By understanding how your body's fat-storing and fat-burning systems work, you're going to learn how to crack the code on true and lifelong waist management.Roizen and Oz will invigorate you with equal parts information, motivation, and change-your-life action to show you how your brain, stomach, hormones, muscles, heart, genetics, and stress levels all interact biologically to determine if your body is the size of a baseball bat or of a baseball stadium. In YOU: On a Diet, Roizen and Oz will redefine what a healthy figure is, then take you through an under-theskin tour of the organs that influence your body's size and its health. You'll even be convinced that the key number to fixate on is not your weight, but your waist size, which best indicates the medical risks of storing too much fat.Because the world has almost as many diet plans as it has e-mail spammers, you'd think that just about all of us would know everything there is to know about dieting, about fat, and about the reasons why our bellies have grown so large. YOU: On a Diet is much more than a diet plan or a series of instructions and guidelines or a faddish berries-only eating plan. It's a complete manual for waist management. It will show you how to achieve and maintain an ideal and healthy body size by providing a lexicon according to which any weight-loss system can be explained. YOU: On a Diet will serve as the operating system that facilitates future evolution in our dieting software. After you learn about the biology of your body and the biology and psychology of fat, you'll be given the YOU Diet and YOU Workout. Both are easy to learn, follow, and maintain. Following a two-week rebooting program will help you lose up to two inches from your waist right from the start.With Roizen and Oz's signature accessibility, wit, and humor, YOU: On a Diet -- The Owner's Manual for Waist Management will revolutionize the way you think about yourself and the food you consume, so that you'll diet smart, not hard. Welcome to your body on a diet.",

        "Authors": "By Thurber, James A. (EDT), Nelson, Candice J. (EDT), and Thurber, James A.",
        "Description": "For the first time, leading political scientists and experienced campaign professionals (many instrumental in the 1992 and 1994 elections) have come together to consider the nuts-and-bolts of American campaigns and elections in conjunction with academic theories and research. Sometimes the two views correspond quite closely\u2014as when academic Paul Herrnson\u2019s research on volunteerism reinforces grassroots campaign specialist Will Robinson\u2019s experience with field operations at the local level. Other times, theory flies in the face of practice, as William Hamilton (campaign pollster) and Raymond Wolfinger (survey research specialist) reveal in essays on the use of campaign surveys. Sam Popkin embodies the essence of the book; he is a key academic who also played an important role in advising the Clinton campaign.The essays in this volume provide a real education in practical campaign politics. Academics and campaign professionals describe the innovation and reality of election campaigns as they have evolved over time to culminate in the 1992 phenomena of town meetings, bus tours, MTV, talk radio, infomercials, and focus groups. Especially relevant to the 1994 midterm elections, we see how campaign themes and strategy are set, how they are communicated, how advanced campaign tactics are used, why mobilizing volunteers is essential, why early campaign money is worth more, how to get the media to cover a campaign without paying for it, and how to use focus groups, survey research, and media to win elections. Offering a unique and careful mix of Democrat and Republican, academic and practitioner, male and female campaign perspectives, this volume scrutinizes national- and local-level campaigns through 1994 with the 1996 elections in mind. Students, citizens, candidates, and campaign managers will learn not only how to win elections, but why it has become imperative to do so in an ethical way.Perfect for a variety of courses in American government, Campaigns and Elections American Style is borne out of the marriage of campaign professionals and academics teaching in American University\u2019s nationally televised Campaign Management Institute. This book is essential reading for political junkies of any stripe and serious students of campaigns and elections. All will be impressed by the clear portrait this volume paints of the professionalization and dramatic transformation of American election campaigns over the last 30 years.",

Every day we hear about the rich getting richer; we buy their products, watch them on television, and wish we could afford their stock. And yet we've never learned how to replicate their success'until now.Picking up where the smash bestseller The Millionaire Next Door left off, Getting Rich in America reveals eight simple, practical, commonsense rules anyone can follow to save a million dollars'without sacrificing quality of life. Based on years of research studying self-made millionaires - and a philosophy that has proven successful for the authors as well - internationally acclaimed economists Dwight R. Lee and Richard B. McKenzie unveil a profound truth in the quest to become wealthy: that getting rich is a choice - and that choosing to be rich, especially in America, has never been easier.In this highly anticipated audiobook, you will meet ordinary folks, just like yourself, who, while making an average income, have amassed at least a million dollars in savings'not through get-rich-quick schemes, but through basic hard work, discipline, patience, and perseverance - without having to live like misers. But why become rich if not to enjoy it? Getting Rich in America does not promote amassing wealth for wealth's sake. You can have that gourmet coffee, take a much-needed vacation, even indulge in filet mignon. With its emphasis on achieving balance, Getting Rich in America is filled with: exercises and easy-to-execute calculations that reveal how the ?little things? really do add up over time to big savings, or to no savings at all; sound advice for creating a fulfilling life; and practical tips for saving and making your money work harder'so you don't have to.Read by Eric Conger.",

        "Title": "The Ravaging Tide: Strange Weather, Future Katrinas, and the Coming Death of America's Coastal Cities",
        "Authors": "By Tidwell, Mike",
        "Description": "If, like many Americans, you believe the ongoing tragedy of Hurricane Katrina was a once-in-a-lifetime fluke, you need to read this book. In the coming years and decades, the safety of your region, your town, your home may depend on the warnings you'll encounter on these pages. That's because the exact same conditions that created the Katrina catastrophe and destroyed New Orleans are being replicated right now along virtually every inch of U.S. coastline.In The Ravaging Tide, Mike Tidwell, a renowned advocate for the environment and an award-winning journalist, issues a call to arms and confronts us with some unsettling facts. Consider:     In the next seventy-five years, much of the Florida peninsula could lie under ocean water.     So could much of Lower Manhattan, including all of the hallowed ground zero area.     Major hurricanes like Katrina, scientists say, are becoming much more frequent and more powerful.     Glacier National Park in Montana will have to change its name, as it is rapidly losing all of its thirty-five remaining glaciers.     The snows atop Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa, so memorably evoked in the Hemingway story, have already disappeared.The fault, Tidwell argues, lies mostly with the U.S. government and the energy choices it has encouraged Americans to make over the decades. Those policies are now actively bringing rising seas and gigantic hurricanes -- the lethal forces that killed the Big Easy -- crashing into every coastal city in the country and indeed the world. The Bush administration's own reports and studies (some of which it has tried to suppress) explicitly predict more intense storms and up to three feet of sea-level rise by 2100 due to planetary warming. The danger is clear: Whether the land sinks three feet per century (as in New Orleans over the past 100 years) or sea levels rise three feet per century (as in the rest of the world over the next 100 years), the resulting calamity is the same.Although Mike Tidwell sounds the clarion in The Ravaging Tide, this is ultimately an optimistic book, one that offers a clear path to a healthier and safer world for us and our descendants. He writes of trend-setting U.S. states like New York and California that are actively cutting greenhouse gases. And he heeds his own words: In one delightful personal chapter, he takes us on a tour of his suburban Washington, D.C., home and demonstrates how he and many of his neighbors have weaned themselves from the fossil-fuel lifestyle. Even when the government is slow to change, there are steps we as families can take to, yes, change the world.",

        "Authors": "By Gilmore, Jennifer",
        "Description": "Golden Country, Jennifer Gilmore's masterful and irreverent reinvention of the Jewish American novel, captures the exuberance of the American dream while exposing its underbelly -- disillusionment, greed, and the disaffection bred by success. As Gilmore's charmingly flawed characters witness and shape history, they come to embody America's greatness, as well as its greatest imperfections.   Spanning the first half of the twentieth century, Golden Country vividly brings to life the intertwining stories of three immigrants seeking their fortunes -- the handsome and ambitious Seymour, a salesman-turned-gangster-turned-Broadway-producer; the gentle and pragmatic Joseph, a door-to-door salesman who is driven to invent a cleanser effective enough to wipe away the shame of his brother's mob connections; and the irresistible Frances Gold, who grows up in Brooklyn, stars in Seymour's first show, and marries the man who invents television. Their three families, though inex-tricably connected for years, are brought together for the first time by the engagement of Seymour's son and Joseph's daughter. David and Miriam's marriage must endure the inheritance of not only their parents' wealth but also the burdens of their past.   Epic and comic, poignant and wise, Golden Country introduces readers to an extraordinary new voice in fiction.",

An aspiring journalist with worlds to conquer, Gabe came to New Mexico to explore the natural wonders of Lost River Cave, with Joy acting as his guide. Surrounded by staggering beauty, they both surrendered to a passion too powerful to deny-and Joy gave herself freely to the most extraordinary man she had ever known. But Gabe was destined for great things, and even the intensity of their shared feelings could not bind him to this place or this romance. And so he left Joy with memories, a broken heart . . . and, months later, a cherished, if painful, reminder of their lost love: a daughter.Seven years have passed, and Joy\u2014now a respected professor\u2014has put what once was behind her, though the memory will always remain alive in the light that shines in the eyes of her beautiful child.Now Gabe, at the pinnacle of his profession, having tasted the fame and adventure that lured him away, has returned.

        "Description": "Now entering Hollywood Nation\u2014where fact blurs with fiction, virtue with viceMillions of Americans are outraged by the radical politics of self-appointed celebrity pundits like Michael Moore, Barbra Streisand, Sean Penn, and Susan Sarandon. And actually, these stars\u2019 public pronouncements could be the least of our worries, as New York Times bestselling author and media critic James Hirsen reveals in Hollywood Nation.Now more than ever, Hirsen shows, Hollywood elites are blurring the lines between entertainment and news to force their views onto the rest of the country. With their politically charged films, distorted documentaries, and skewed docudramas, they\u2019re trying to set the agenda with little regard for the truth. Even worse, many so-called journalists are doing the same thing, dangerously mixing information and entertainment in an attempt to ratchet up ratings\u2014and to inject their own views into the news.Hollywood Nation also reveals how the New Media are now leading the counterattack against the relentless liberal assault that comes from East Coast newsrooms and Left Coast studios. Through his extensive research and exclusive interviews with news and entertainment iconoclasts\u2014including Bill O\u2019Reilly, Mel Gibson, Ann Coulter, Dick Morris, Peggy Noonan, Laurie Dhue, and many others\u2014Hirsen shows how liberals can no longer dominate the political and cultural debates. With a sharp eye and a keen wit, Hirsen takes the reader on a fun and fascinating journey through this Hollywood nation of ours. Along the way you\u2019ll discover:\u2022How mainstream media figures\u2019 fame fundamentally distorts the delivery of news\u2022How far news organizations are going in their quest to sex things up\u2014and what celebrity journalists are saying about the plastic surgery push \u2022An exclusive behind-the-scenes account of Mel Gibson\u2019s The Passion of the Christ\u2014a fascinating story that captures how the Left is finally losing its stranglehold on information\u2022A cable news journalist spilling the beans about a rival news channel\u2019s commercial stunt\u2022How Michael Moore\u2019s films are heralding a new trend toward over-the-top liberal propaganda\u2014but how a newly emerging conservative Hollywood is fighting back\u2022How the New Media are shaking things up and evening things outThese days we\u2019re just one big Hollywood nation.

For fourteen years, I have had to prove my skill as a driver and earn the respect of my competition through hard work, determination, dedication, and perseverance. I want to show anyone trying to succeed that anything is possible and that, though being a woman might describe me, it doesnt define who I am on or off the track.\"Danica Patrick's life moves at 220 mph. She drives every race and lives every day like she has something to prove -- and she does. A 5-foot 2-inch,100-pound woman, Danica had to qualify a little quicker and race a little faster than the boys. And that was just to earn the respect she would otherwise be given if she werent the \"girl on the track, driving the princess mobile.\" Shes had to defend herself, her skill, her ability, and her gender. But you don't get to be an IndyCar driver without talent and determination. Even the drivers who stay at the back of the pack are skilled and capable, but the back of the pack is the last place that Danica wants to be -- on the track or in life.Danica is a small-town girl who had a big-boy dream and a family who helped her believe that anything was possible. She is living proof that if you work hard and aim high, you can do whatever you set your mind to, that you can rise to any challenge, and that what makes you different is what makes you great. Danica shares secrets and stories, tales from the track, and insights into her personal life that reveal the spirit and drive packed into this all-star athlete and woman. From the exhilaration and freedom she felt when she stepped on the pedal of her first go-kart at age ten through her sensational rookie season that turned Indy racing on its head, Danica invites readers into her life.Danica takes us through her early racing years, competing against the boys she now beats as men, and her time in England, battling homesickness, insult, and injury. She talks about the support of the legendary Bobby Rahal, having the best crew in the league, and adjusting to the frenetic pace and attention of \"Danica mania.\" Through all this, shes been blessed with a close-knit family and has been fortunate enough to find true love. Danica competes on a man's level and in a man's sport like no other woman in sports ever has. This book details her extraordinary rise from a ten-year-old go-kart champion to a twenty-three-year-old Indy star, and her unique perspective on how to compete in life, how to stand out, and how to get the respect and attention we deserve.",
