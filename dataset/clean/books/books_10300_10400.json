        "Title": "Towns Without Rivers",
        "Authors": "By Parker, Michael",
        "Description": "In his stirring second novel, Michael Parker paints a vivid portrait of a young woman determined to escape her past. Revisiting Trent -- the Southern town so poignantly rendered in his acclaimed first novel, Hello Down There -- Parker turns his attention to Reka Speight, a character whose strength of spirit brings her as passionately to life as any female character in contemporary literary fiction.Reka Speight is determined to discover a wider world than the rural backwater that has an almost malevolent grip on her. Armed with nothing but her sharp instincts and a hard-won education she earned while behind bars, Reka lies her way into a job that takes her thousands of miles west.But it also takes her away from the one person she cares about, her younger brother Randall. Their special bond has always set them apart from the rest of the Speight clan; Reka knows she can't be happy until Randall has escaped their family's legacy of poverty, narrow-mindedness, and alcoholism. Reka hasn't seen Randall since she was released from jail, and she must entrust her father with a letter explaining her departure -- and how Randall can find her -- in the hopes that he will soon follow.So begins a journey that takes Reka from North Carolina to Montana to Seattle; from steamy Trent to climates colder than she's ever imagined; from prison bars to the World's Fair; and from her dead lover's bedside into the arms of a man she can't forget, no matter how hard she tries. Through it all, Randall is always on her mind. Although returning to Trent means risking everything she has achieved to escape, Reka realizes she and her brother are bound together by a force stronger than will. What she can't know is that Randall's own wanderings have taken him into even darker territories, and that his quest to find the sister he has always emulated may prove more difficult than he expects...now that the only strength he has to rely on is his own.In a striking tale of one iron-willed woman's determination to decide her own fate, Towns Without Rivers reveals the consequences of taking your life into your own hands and the astonishing resiliency of the human spirit. Probing one of the great conflicts of literature, Michael Parker's triumphant novel asks us whether the absence of love really must be the price of survival.",

        "Authors": "By Hubler, Clark",
        "Description": "In America's Mountains, noted science professor Clark Hubler journeys back to prehistoric times in an attempt to explain the less than-mystical origins of North America's magnificent mountains and to anticipate future changes in their evolution. The book begins with an exploration of orogeny, the process of mountain building, which began millions of years ago when a combination of violent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions shook the Earth. This ongoing process can be witnessed today in the Alaskan mountain ranges, where ocean beds press up against the continent, causing gradual land shifts and creating immense pressure buildups. When the force becomes too great, the land slips, an earthquake occurs and the ruptured landmass begins a slow rise on its way to becoming a full-fledged mountain range.Other chapters investigate the dramatic influence of mountains on plants, animals, people and the general environment. The Olympic Mountains in northwest Washington, for example, experience six times more rainfall than East Coast locations, such as New York and Boston. Other sections include fascinating descriptions of landmark geologic forms, such as the Rocky Mountains, the Appalachian Mountains, the Ouachita Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico, glaciers in Canada and Alaska, and plains and plateaus of the West.The book also includes detailed information on rocks and fossils, and on mountains that have been eroded out of existence. Finally, Hubler speculates on what may happen in the next million years as oceans continue to grow and continents continue to shudder.",

Obsessed with \"making things good again,\" they spin the quiet terrors of family life into fantastical frenzy that careens out of control, doing and saying all the things we dare not, throwing into full relief the chasm between our public and private selves. From a strange and hilarious encounter on the floor of the pantry with a Stepford-wife neighbor, to an ill-concieved plan for a tattoo, to a sexy town cop who shows up at every inopportuune moment, to house cleaning team in space suits, to a mistress calling on the cell phone, to a hostage situation at the school, Homes creates characters so outrageously flawed and deeply human that they are entirely believable.

He had been the wild, hard-drinking scion of one of America's premier political families. She was the school librarian with a warm smile and a tragic secret of her own. Yet after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, they rose to the challenge: He became the embodiment of America's fighting spirit and she assumed the role of \"First Comforter\" with effortless grace. Still, the true nature of their relationship has remained a mystery.Until now. In the style of his #1 New York Times bestsellers The Day Diana Died and The Day John Died, as well as his bestselling books about another President and First Lady, Jack and Jackie and Jackie After Jack, Christopher Andersen draws on important sources -- many speaking here for the first time -- to paint a vivid, sometimes startling, often inspiring portrait of America's First Couple. Among the intriguing insights and stunning revelations: Important new information about 9/11 and its aftermath -- including a gripping moment-by-moment account of how the President and First Lady coped as the horrific drama unfolded.The true extent of George W.'s drinking problem, the strains it put on his marriage, and the ultimatum that changed his life -- and the course of history.Their heartbreaking battle against infertility and how close Laura came to dying in childbirth.The early tragedies that shaped them, including the car crash caused by a teenage Laura that took the life of a former boyfriend -- and changed her life forever.Laura's surprising behind-the-scenes influence on U.S. policy -- foreign and domestic.The pressures of raising headstrong twin daughters in the glare of the media -- and how 9/11 has brought the Bushes and their children closer together than ever before.George and Laura is a compelling look at their unique partnership, and the courage, grace, and humor that defines it. It is a stirring wartime saga of triumph and tragedy and, above all, a uniquely American love story.",

Born and reared as house slaves on Montpelier, the Virginia plantation of President James Madison and his wife, Dolley Madison, they are united by love, by a fierce devotion to each other and their fellow slaves, and by a growing desire for freedom--a dream that will finally come to fruition for Susan at the end of the Civil War. This hauntingly beautiful novel opens in the peaceful Piedmont area of Virginia. Trained as a house slave since childhood, Susie enjoys the privileges that her position as maid to Miss Dolley provides her and Clara. For Susie life holds no mystery, no promise beyond the boundaries of the plantation itself--a lesson she tries to impart to the dreamy Clara, who longs to control her own destiny despite her mother's frightening admonition: \"You don't know a thing about freedom, 'cause I don't know anything about it. It takes money and know-how to live free. You don't just up and do it.\"  Life will change for both mother and daughter, though, with the death of James Madison and the departure of his wife for her town house, events that leave the estate in the hands of Dolley's profligate son, Todd. As a result of his neglectful stewardship, the plantation soon falls to a series of owners, each posing a new threat to Susie and Clara, and the other longtime Madison slaves with whom the two women have shared their entire lives. Amidst these devastating changes, Clara grows into womanhood and becomes a mother herself, giving birth to two light-skinned daughters, Ellen and Susan. Yet the threat of separation that has shaped her life is soon a reality when her younger daughter, Susan, is sold to a wealthy businessman in Richmond. Susan must create a new life for herself in this bustling city, a life that will be filled with both terror and hope . And it is in Civil War-torn Richmond that she will find love and realize the long-held dream of her ancestors: freedom. In A Long Way from Home, Connie Briscoe vividly recreates Southern life and the ambivalent, shifting relationships on both sides of the color divide, from the cruelty and insidious benevolence of white owners to the deep yearnings and complex emotions of the slaves themselves. This poignant, powerful story pays homage to the African-American experience and to the ancestors, both black and white, whose lives and histories are indelibly entwined with our own.",

Most women think that the only way to manage the mounting chaos in their lives is to take control and organize, organize, organize. No wonder we have overwhelming to-do lists that leave us feeling exhausted and powerless! But in I Used to Have a Handle on Life but It Broke, Mary LoVerde has a better idea.  Showing us that the opposite of control is not chaos but contentment, LoVerde demonstrates how to counter the natural urge to assume responsibility for everything. In place of frustrating and futile controlling strategies, she gives readers straightforward techniques for maintaining their energy and keeping their balance no matter what life throws their way. Recognizing that we often confuse control with power, LoVerde delineates six solutions that will help women change from striving for control to thriving with true power:  1. Pose good questions  2. Pay attention 3. Predict your Achilles' heel 4. Partner with women 5. Pause before judging 6. Position yourself  With her trademark sense of humor and the compassionate voice that has earned her such a strong national following, Mary LoVerde shows us that the result of letting go is not a black hole of dirty laundry and unpaid bills, but a life that is light, free, and joyful.",

He finds out, but only after his girlfriend decides to split (just as he was about to say the 'L' word--and almost mean it), he makes a fool of himself on the BBC, his mother suddenly dies, and his estranged father shows up--a series of catastrophes that push him to the edge and then some. As Scott's self-centered world begins to unravel, he discovers that the key to a happy existence just might be found in a happy relationship. But before he can move on into a new life and a new love, he has to figure out how to get Norman II, a stolen penguin, back to the zoo.Men and Other Mammals is a hilarious and touching tale about figuring out what and who really matter in life. Keeble shows us that loving someone is a choice you must make every day for the rest of your life--and that loving someone is often a lot harder than not having someone to love.",

For those living in areas where it's still snowing, and even where it's just cold or rainy, it's the time of year when magazines, newspapers, radio, and television are tantalizing us with ads of warm beaches, sunshine, relaxation, water sports, and foo-foo drinks with little umbrellas sticking out of them.Many of us would love to be able to travel to someplace warm, or to a far away place for a new adventure. However, we may not have the time or the resources to do so. Fortunately, Travelers' Tales has just the armchair adventure travel anyone can experience -- the beaches of Thailand, dining on the banks of the Seine, running with the bulls of Pamplona, purchasing a suit in Hong Kong, climbing the Himalayas -- all for only $17.95 (no shots or visa required).O'Reilly and Travelers' Tales have created a national campaign to help you promote Travelers' Tales titles as the \"great getaway -- for cheap\". We'll provide you with marketing materials (signage, T-shirts, buttons, postcards, special discount for inventory order, ad slick, and book displays) to create a window or in-store display during the month of May 1997. The store with the best display wins an overstuffed armchair fully equipped with an airline style seat belt.We'll also provide you with shelftalker coupon books with space on the front for you to stamp your store name and address. The coupon is redeemable for 10% off the purchase of a Travelers' Tales book. Your customer simply tears off the coupon from the shelftalker, completes the information (name and address) on the back, and gives it to the cashier when they're ready to purchase a book. At the end of each month you send us thecoupons used by your customers, and we'll credit your account. We understand that you might be hesitant to send in coupons with the names and addresses of your customers. The reason for retrieving this information is so you can build your customer list, and so we can send a Travelers' Tales newsletter to your customers informing them of new titles available from their local bookstore -- including a reference to your store.",

Caroline is the chatelaine of a magnificent home, hostess to her husband&#39;s wealthy friends and prospective clients, and the official \"one-woman welcome wagon\" for young, eager talent that her husband, Clay, imports to their corner of South Carolina to work for the family company -- a vastly successful land-developing conglomerate.  If Caro drinks a little too much for Clay&#39;s liking, he knows the reason why, and he takes comfort in the fact that she can escape to the island in the Lowcountry that her beloved Granddaddy left her. Wild and seemingly timeless, the island is a place of incomparable,  breathtaking  beauty -- and it is the one place where Caroline can lose herself and simply forget. Roaming the island is a band of wild ponies whose freedom and spirit have captivated Caro since she was a child. When she learns that her husband must either develop the island or lose the company that he spent his whole life building, she is devastated. The Lowcountry is Caroline&#39;s heritage -- the one constant she believed would never change. A resort would not only tame (and therefore destroy) the island she loves -- but what will happen to the wild ponies? Spurred to action and inspired with new purpose, Caroline must confront the part of herself that she has numbed with alcohol and careful avoidance, and she must reconsider her priorities -- what is important enough that she would die for it? In fighting to save the island--her island -- Caroline draws on an inner strength that forces her to reconsider her role in society, her marriage and, ultimately, herself. Low Country is a story of personal renewal and transformation -- one woman&#39;s proper Old South upbringing and expectations colliding with the new South&#39;s runaway prosperity. It is magnificently told, and it is Anne Rivers Siddons at her absolute best.",

        "Description": "What is the effect of long-term media violence on our national character? Do we want four-year-olds watching slasher films? Who should decide?While almost everyone has a strong opinion about the profusion of violence-in film, TV, video games, and on line-paralysis sets in when it comes to action. The issue is seen as a hopeless standoff between free speech and preserving public morality. In Mayhem, Sissela Bok reframes the issue. She shows us that we have created a false dilemma and that we need not feel so helpless.Mayhem lays out the arguments and weighs the evidence on each side: the desensitization, fear, and addiction that concern psychologists, pediatricians, and religious groups on the one hand, and, on the other, the threat of censorship invoked by journalists, civil libertarians, and the entertainment industry. The book gives a vivid historical overview of the debate: from Rome, to nineteenth-century attempts to ban all theater, to censorship of the Internet in Singapore and China, and contrasting views of figures as diverse as Martin Scorsese, Bill Moyers, and Judge Bork.As in Lying and Secrets, she puts this thorny question in clarifying perspective, and shows how our ways of dealing with it not only express, but can shape our character and lives. Finally, she takes up specific and imaginative ways to resolve the dilemma, from private measures for individuals and families to large-scale collective efforts.",

Nolan's birth injuries left him quadriplegic and completely unable to communicate, so for years no one suspected that his mind, though imprisoned in an inert body, was burning to express his innermost thoughts and ideas to not only his family but the world. Whether he is fighting with the authorities for the right to go to an ordinary school, or going on a \"normal\" vacation for the first time, Nolan's story has a touching, often breathtaking intensity. Nolan recounts his ultimate triumph of finally being able to share with others the insight and whimsy of his inner world, unlocking the inventive wordsmith and gifted storyteller within. The result is astonishingly lyrical, filled with powerful description, touching moments of triumph, sadness, and anger, and above all disarming wit.",

A national bestseller, her empowering fable won the Western State Book Award in 1993 and the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Book Award in 1994. Translated into 16 languages, it went on to international success, quickly reaching bestseller status in Germany. To date, more than 350,000 copies have been sold worldwide.   Bird Girl and the Man Who Followed the Sun follows in this bestselling tradition. Rooted in the ancient legends of Alaska's Athabaskan Indians, it tells the stories of two adventurers who decide to leave the safety of their respective tribes. Bird Girl is a headstrong young woman who learned early on the skills of a hunter. When told that she must end her forays and take up the traditional role of wife and mother, she defies her family's expectations and confidently takes off to brave life on her own. Daagoo is a dreamer, curious about the world beyond. Longing to know what happens to the sun in winter, he sets out on a quest to find the legendary \"Land of the Sun.\" Their stories interweave and intersect as they each face the many dangers and challenges of life alone in the wilderness. In the end, both learn that the search for individualism often comes at a high price, but that it is a price well worth paying, for through this quest comes the beginning of true wisdom.",
