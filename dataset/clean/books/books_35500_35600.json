        "Description": "Cop-turned-lawyer Stone Barrington has the street smarts, dry wit, and debonair charm his fans love, and Palm Beach, the setting of his new adventure, is his most glamorous scene-of-the-crime yet. In Cold Paradise, he becomes reacquainted with a case he thought was buried years ago, and must settle romantic entanglements that haunt him still.Allison Manning, the beautiful and enigmatic woman Stone defended against a murder charge in Dead in the Water, mysteriously reappears to request his help with a set of problems she has never resolved, which involve millions of dollars. She fears, too, that somebody might be stalking her, but she's not sure who - or why. She knows of no one better than Stone, who has both the legal experience and the investigative instincts to guarantee her safety today and make sure she survives tomorrow as well.Stone is happy to enjoy a few days of paradise in the sun - and to have left frigid New York and the tempestuous Dolce Bianchi behind - but before he can dig into this latest case, he comes face to face again with Arrington Calder, the one woman who still holds a key to his affections.Stone and his partner, Dino, comb the glittering streets of Palm Beach and begin to suspect that more than one person might be after Allison: one so clever he manages never to show his face, but even more frightening, another man everybody has long forgotten. In a search that ranges from the boardrooms of Manhattan to the sumptuous villas that line the Gold Coast, Stone uncovers the sly and greedy plan to steal millions of dollars - and reveals the crafty killer behind it - in this electrifying new thriller.",

        "Description": "The Poet Laureate's clear and entertaining account of how poetry works.\"Poetry is a vocal, which is to say a bodily, art,\" Robert Pinsky declares in The Sounds of Poetry. \"The medium of poetry is the human body: the column of air inside the chest, shaped into signifying sounds in the larynx and the mouth. In this sense, poetry is as physical or bodily an art as dancing.\"As Poet Laureate, Pinsky is one of America's best spokesmen for poetry. In this fascinating book, he explains how poets use the \"technology\" of poetry--its sounds--to create works of art that are \"performed\" in us when we read them aloud. He devotes brief, informative chapters to accent and duration, syntax and line, like and unlike sounds, blank and free verse. He cites examples from the work of fifty different poets--from Shakespeare, Donne, and Herbert to W. C. Williams, Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, C. K. Williams, Louise Gl\u00fcck, and Frank Bidart.This ideal introductory volume belongs in the library of every poet and student of poetry.",

This bird of prey was declared the national symbol in 1782 but, by the 1960s, pollution and development had wiped out all but a few dozen. Grassroots movements started, the American consciousness was raised to all environmental threats, and federal laws were passed to keep the eagle population alive. This stunning book of full-color photographs and touching stories chronicles this inspiring success story with awe-inspiring shots of eagles in flight. There is also a one-of-a-kind directory to more than 150 areas in the nation where eagles are likely to be seen in the wild, soaring once again against the blue skies of freedom. This book is a monument to the efforts that combined animal instinct for survival with the power of the human spirit to change the world.",

There is a secret language of golf that goes far beyond par and birdie.  How much of it do you actually know?... On the 18th tee, Jimbo decided to let the big dog eat.  Feeling the pressure, he foozled and hit a wormburner into the mahoofka.  His mulligan turned into a culligan when he launched a lateral into the drink.  The rest of the hole was all military golf.  On his approach, he chili-dipped and landed on the beach, where he found himself facing Yasir Arafat.  Jimbo grabbed his spatula and escaped from the cat box and onto the froghair, only to fall prey to a case of the yips.  Jimbo ended up carding a snowman by the time he left the dance floor.

Cruising up and down the U.S. eastern seaboard, they sank 259 ships, littering the waters with cargo and bodies. As astonished civilians witnessed explosions from American beaches, fighting men dubbed the area \"Torpedo Junction.\" And while the U.S. Navy failed to react, a handful of Coast Guard sailors scrambled to the front lines. Outgunned and out-maneuvered, they heroically battled the deadliest fleet of submarines ever launched. Never was Germany closer to winning the war.In a moving ship-by-ship account of terror and rescue at sea, Homer Hickam chronicles a little-known saga of courage, ingenuity, and triumph in the early years of World War II. From nerve-racking sea duels to the dramatic ordeals of sailors and victims on both sides of the battle, Hickam dramatically captures a war we had to win\u2014because this one hit terrifyingly close to home.",

The first, from loneliness to solitude, focuses on the spiritual life as it relates to the experience of our own selves. The second, from hostility to hospitality, deals with our spiritual life as a life for others. The final movement, from illusion to prayer, offers penetrating thoughts on the most mysterious relationship of all: our relationship to God. Throughout, Nouwen emphasizes that the more we understand (and not simply deny) our inner struggles, the more fully we will be able to embrace a prayerful and genuine life that is also open to others' needs.Reaching Out is a rich book to be read, reread, pondered, and shared with others. \"It does not offers answers or solutions,\" Nouwen cautions, \"but is written in the conviction that the quest for an authentic Christian spirituality is worth the effort and the pain, since in the midst of this quest we can find signs offering hope, courage, and confidence.\"",

        "Description": "This is the first text in the rapidly growing study of the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality in the United States today. Using clear and accessible language, analysis of case studies, and a progression of questions for critical reflection, the text presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the interlocking nature of race, class, gender, and sexuality systems of oppression. The framework illustrates that race, class, gender, and sexuality are: socially constructed, historically and globally specific power relations that are simultaneously expressed at the macro/institutional and the micro/individual levels. The analysis presented is complex, addresses the intersections of oppressive systems without rank ordering them, and points toward effective strategies to promote social justice.  A leader in the development of race, class, gender, and sexuality scholarship, Weber has carefully devised the pedagogy of the text and the case studies to reflect the knowledge she has gained from almost twenty years of teaching and consulting with faculty and students across the country about the most effective ways to communicate these complex and sometimes emotionally charged ideas in ways that engage diverse audiences.",
