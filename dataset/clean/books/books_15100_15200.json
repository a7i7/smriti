They offer bonuses to physicians who spend less on your care, push the sick out of hospitals before they should, deny access to state-of-the-art treatment, and cancel insurance policies for the ill. These groups have access to powerful computer systems that can pinpoint the best hospitals, doctors, and treatments as well as the cheapest. Which will they choose? For you, each is a double agent who can choose between excellent treatment or cut-rate health care.The Best Medicine arms you, the consumer, with the same powerful knowledge in a simple, step-by-step guide so you can make the right choice. Until now, this has been privileged information. Insurers, health policy planners, and corporate benefits departments have tried to keep this knowledge out of consumers' hands.CBS News medical correspondent, Dr. Bob Arnot, draws from a decade of experience reporting on state-of-the-art medicine. His accessible guide protects you from the flaws in American medicine and from the bean counters. He provides the precise standards of quality that health-care consumers can and must demand of both doctors and hospitals. This information, never before available, can save your life. Dr. Arnot does what he does best, empowers you with expert knowledge to get the best available health care.Every chapter has been carefully reviewed by top specialists in each field.",

As rival papers in the city fail in the wake of his ruthlessness, he is poised to move on to even greater things.On the other side of the world, in Australia, Keith Townsend, son of a millionaire newspaper owner, is being groomed to follow in his father's footsteps. Private schools, an Oxford degree, and a position at a London newspaper lead him up to the time of his father's death, when he takes over the family business. His energy and brilliant strategic thinking quickly make him the leading newspaper publisher in Australia. Yet he too longs to move on to the world stage.The Fourth Estate is the timely and compelling story of two men who, though they come from totally different backgrounds, stand face-to-face on the highest precipice, prepared to risk everything to beat each other and control the biggest media empire in the world.",

When Mr. Mee comes across a reference to the Xanthics, an obsolete sect that maintained unorthodox beliefs about fire, his hunt for more information compels him to try locating a copy of the singular encyclopedia. Technologically ignorant, Mr. Mee is at last persuaded by his addled housekeeper to conduct a modern search for the book on the Internet. But instead of finding additional clues about Rosier's Encyclopaedia, Mr. Mee stumbles upon an image of a naked woman reading from an intriguing text.Alternating among the three stories, Andrew Crumey takes us closer to the truth about Rosier's Encyclopaedia and the secrets it contains. At times funny, often thought-provoking, and completely engaging, Mr. Mee is Crumey's most rewarding novel to date.",

        "Description": "\"Welcome home, Linyaari child!\"Acorna's quest has paid off. With the help of her \"uncles\" and the thousands of humans who love and admire her, she has found her true people at last.  And they have found her--Khornya, daughter of the illustrious Feriila and the valiant Vaanye, who was given up for lost after the insect-like Khleevi  destroyed their home planet.  Abandoned in space as a baby, rescued and raised by gruff human asteroid miners, Acorna is at last among her own. The beautiful healing horn in the center of her forehead and the \"funny\" feet and hands that once set her apart now make her one with the telepathic Linyaari who live on as lush agrarian planet where they pursue their peaceful dreams.   Acorna's people welcome her with a lavish costume ball--and an already-chosen mate! But Acorna still has much to do before she can enjoy the peaceful home she is offered. The legendary resting place of the lost Linyaari ancestors has yet to be found. With the help of the rogue spacetrader Becker and his cat, RK (RoadKill), Acorna must strive to right an unspeakable wrong and defeat an enemy even more cruel than the Khleevi themselves.   In the search, Acorna and her new friends rescue another survivor, also given up for lost. Most importantly, though, Acorna at last uncovers the Universe's most carefully guarded secret--the true nature of the ancient link between the hoofed, telepathic Linyaari  and the space-faring humans she has come to think of as her \"people\" as well.   In all literature, there is no creature more wondrous, no girl more beautiful, no youth more adventurous than Anne McCaffrey's beloved Unicorn Girl. Acorna and Acorna's Quest told of her childhood and early youth. Now award-winning author Elizabeth Ann Scarborough joins Anne McCaffrey to continue the saga of this beloved character in a story that will delight every fan and win new hearts, too. Acorna's People is a story for readers of all ages--especially those who have not yet lost (or who still remember) the magic that lives in the hearts of the young.",

        "Authors": "By Perkins, Michael C. and Perkins, Anthony B.",
        "Description": "The spectacular Bull Market in high-tech stocks is the investment story of the decade. The numbers are astonishing.  The Internet boom has created new household names such as Yahoo, Amazon, and America Online -- companies that today command billions in market value.  Internet startups like Healtheon and eBay have seen their stocks sky-rocket over 3000 percent since their IPOs, and dozens of other Internet stocks have doubled, tripled, and even quadrupled on their first day of trading.  Here is a market where:  entrepreneurs like the thirty-something founders of Yahoo and Amazon become global billionaires overnight;  money-losing startups command market valuations that make the captains of traditional industry cry their hearts out and tremble with competitive fear; and venture capitalists and investment bankers cash in big on companies barely out of the cradle. But individual retail investors -- the outsiders in this turn of  the century roulette game -- are left to foot the bill, paying exorbitant prices for stocks that will end up diving off a cliff.  TheInternet Bubble  is the story of the turbulent world ofhigh-tech stocks, a place where fortunes aremade and lost in a day.  This book uncovers the innerworkingsof an industry that increasingly thrives ongreed and hype.  It shows who is really getting rich, and how they use small investors to finance their empires.  Silicon Valley insiders Anthony and Michael Perkins provide a behind-the-scenes look at the forces -- and the people -- stoking the money engine in the technology stock market.  They show how the allure of fast-paced innovation and overnight success has driven an ongoing market frenzy around Internetstocks, creating what they call an \"Internet Bubble.\" Most important, the authors show that, when the Bubble inevitably bursts, Main Street -- not Wall Street -- will take the big hit, unless individual investors take steps to protect themselves now. This is a book that will make every investor in America think twice before chasing the latest \"hot\" Internet stock.",

        "Description": "In RIVER-HORSE, the preeminent chronicler of American back roads -- who has given us the classics BLUE HIGHWAYS and PRAIRYERTH -- recounts his singular voyage on American waters from sea to sea. Along the route, he offers a lyrical and ceaselessly fascinating shipboard perspective on the country's rivers, lakes, canals, and towns. Brimming with history, drama, humor, and wisdom, RIVER-HORSE belongs in the pantheon of American travel literature. In his most ambitious journey ever, Heat-Moon sets off aboard a small boat he named Nikawa (\"river horse\" in Osage) from the Atlantic at New York Harbor in hopes of entering the Pacific near Astoria, Oregon. He and his companion, Pilotis, struggle to cover some five thousand watery miles -- more than any other cross-country river traveler has ever managed -- often following in the wakes of our most famous explorers, from Henry Hudson to Lewis and Clark. En route, the voyagers confront massive floods, submerged rocks, dangerous weather, and their own doubts about whether they can complete the trip. But the hard days yield up incomparable pleasures: strangers generous with help and eccentric tales, landscapes unchanged since Sacagawea saw them, riverscapes flowing with a lively past, and the growing belief that efforts to protect our lands and waters are beginning to pay off. And, throughout its course, the expedition enjoys coincidences so breathtaking as to suggest the intervention of a divine and witty Providence. Teeming with humanity and high adventure, Heat-Moon's account is an unsentimental and original arteriogram of our nation at the edge of the millennium. Masterly in its own right, RIVER-HORSE, when taken with BLUE HIGHWAYS and PRAIRYERTH, forms the capstone of a peerless and timeless trilogy.",

Instead, the attack provokes a Constitutional crisis -- and splits the U.S. government down the middle.Jim Dillon, Special Assistant to the Speaker of the House, discovers a long-forgotten clause in the Constitution that allows Congress to take military action without presidential approval, and his ambitious boss sees an opportunity to humiliate his rival in the Oval Office. Over at the White House, Dillon's old friend Molly is working feverishly on a legal strategy to block the Speaker's gambit; the case moves swiftly toward the Supreme Court -- and a trial drama that equals anything found in a Grisham thriller.Meanwhile, in the Pacific, a \"rogue\" U.S. Navy battle group races toward a deadly rendezvous with terrorists. With H-Hour drawing ever closer, fighter jocks, Navy SEALs, and Marine assault teams prepare for action in a frenzy of activity that sweeps from the carrier's high-tech intelligence center to the high-tension cockpit of an F-14 to the Marines storming ashore on a tropical island. The author was a carrier pilot himself, and the military scenes crackle with authentic detail that outdoes Clancy.Flashing between the political clash in Washington and the countdown to assault halfway around the globe,  Balance of Power builds to a suspenseful crescendo that blends political battles, legal skirmishing, and naval warfare into a blockbuster that's sure to explode onto bestseller lists all over America.",

With Against the Brotherhood and Embassy Row, novelist Quinn Fawcett introduced us to a part of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's world hitherto unexamined, and featured perhaps the most intriguing sleuth to come along since Sherlock himself.The Flying Scotsman is a luxury train and the fastest way to travel between London and Edinburgh. The Scotsman is also the secret escape route for a European prince who has narrowly escaped assassination at a royal wedding. The Prince was in London to negotiate a treaty between his country and England; the British government believes that the assassination is an attempt to keep the treaty from being finalized and signed. Now he must be safely returned to his homeland.Mycroft Holmes is assigned to be the prince's protector. Posing as travel writers, Mycroft and Paterson Guthrie, his able assistant and the chronicler of his adventures, board the Scotsman along with the Prince for what should be a quick pleasure trip to Scotland - one that is interrupted almost immediately by a death that may be another try at murdering the Prince.Guthrie soon spots some familiar faces among his fellow passengers. He and Mycroft have tangled with Sir Cameron MacMillian before. Is the Scottish laird merely heading home aboard the luxurious train, or is his evil political cabal behind the assassination attempts? Then there's Penelope Gatspy, the beautiful anarchist and sometime assassin. Is she after the Prince - or Guthrie?",

Are women who were raised in alcoholic families, adult daughters, different from women who were raised in non-alcoholic families? Dr. Ackerman, a leading expert on alcoholism and the family and especially on children of alcoholics of all ages, has brought together the thoughts, ideas and feelings of more than 1200 women in this first book on adult daughters of alcoholics.Do you find yourself represented in any of the following statements from adult daughters? If I please everyone, everyone will be happy If I don't get too close emotionally, no one can hurt me Nothing is wrong but I don't feel right Something is missing from my life My relationships usually consist of a lack of trust, fear of intimacy, low self-worth, over-responsibility and picking the wrong person. If you often feel isolated, engage in self-condemnation, experience inconsistency, always want to be in control, rely heavily on others for their approval and believe that you must be perfect, you have many things in common with other adult daughters. Adult daughters are beginning to talk about their experiences, express their fears and share their growth. This book represents many of the stories of childhood pain and the paths to recovery that have been found by many Perfect Daughters.",

        "Description": "New York Times bestselling author Joan Johnston has captivated millions of readers with her sprawling, sensuous novels about the two opposing dynasties of Bitter Creek, Texas -- the Blackthornes and the Creeds. Now in her highly anticipated hardcover debut, Johnston tells an impassioned story of love and danger, ambition and family, that features the popular character Luke Creed, a young man who has turned his back on his family's ranch to pursue his fortune as an attorney at Houston's most powerful law firm.  Even though the stress and the punishing hours of his job as a litigation associate at DeWitt & Blackthorne have cost him his marriage and quality time with his two young daughters, Luke Creed remains fiercely driven to succeed. When Luke takes on the defense of a pharmaceutical company in an explosive wrongful death suit that could make or break his career, he is surprised to find himself squared off against the woman he has always loved, Amy Hazeltine Nash, his high school sweetheart. A single mother recovering from a failed marriage, Amy is a passionate advocate for her bereaved client and is shocked that once-rebellious Luke is now a member of the Establishment, representing corporate interests. But Amy cannot deny the feelings that seeing Luke rekindles in her heart.  Concerned that his client may be lying, Luke investigates the case more closely, which means spending more time with Amy with whom a new romance begins to blossom. But when one of Luke's colleagues dies under suspicious circumstances, he finds he is in danger of losing not only the case but his life. With help from Amy and a trio of fearless colleagues, Luke delves into a dangerous web of corruption that involves his client and his firm. In doing so he has no choice but to question the price of his own ambitions.  From the towering skyscrapers of Houston to the majestic plains of south Texas ranch country, The Price sweeps readers into a powerfully engrossing, passionate novel that will keep them on the edge of their seats as it explores the questions of what is truly important in life and how high a price a person is willing to pay to achieve his or her ambitions.",
