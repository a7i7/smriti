        "Description": "This book reveals that the magical healing power of foods extends well beyond the vitamins and minerals they contain. You'll learn about phytonutrients, the thousands of natural substances with names like quercetin (found in apples), lycopene (found in tomatoes and apricots), and sulforaphane (found in cruciferous vegetables) - many of which are more powerful than vitamins in protecting our health. These substances have the ability to slow or even stop many of the most serious health threats facing Americans today, from cancer to heart disease, high blood pressure, and stroke. Researchers suspect that some phytonutrients can stop - or even reverse - many of the signs of aging.Of course, different foods contain different mixes of healing powers. With Prevention's New Foods for Healing, you'll discover how to choose your protection. You'll learn how to use dozens of the most-powerful healing foods to prevent and treat over 50 specific health threats. You'll find out how much of these foods you need to eat to get the healing benefits and even how to prepare them to get the maximum healing power.Plus, there are 150 recipes that feature the healing foods and are just brimming with health and great taste - making this the most complete, up-to-date guide to the healing power of foods.",

        "Description": "The highly acclaimed author of Lempriere's Dictionary, a New York Times Notable Book of 1992, returns with a vivid, antic, and picaresque novel spun around one of history's most bizarre chapters: the sixteenth-century attempt to procure a rhinoceros as a bribe for Pope Leo X. Set in an age of global expansion, The Pope's Rhinoceros holds up the history of the rhinoceros as a mirror to the obsessions and corrupt fantasies of the Renaissance.In February 1516, a Portuguese ship sank off the coast of Italy. The Nostra Senora de Ajuda had sailed 14,000 miles from the Indian kingdom of Gujarat. Her mission: to bribe the \"pleasure-loving Pope\" into favoring expansionist Portugal over her rival Spain with the most exotic and least likely of gifts - a living rhinoceros.This strange incident is the germ of truth within the unfettered fantasy of Lawrence Norfolk's intricately plotted, marvelously detailed, seductively intriguing second novel - a triumph of storytelling that is as arcane and erudite as it is compelling and entertaining. Moving from the herring colonies of the Baltic Sea to the West African rainforest, with a cast of characters including a resourceful ex-mercenary, Salvestro; his dimwitted comrade, Bernardo; an order of reclusive monks; and Rome's corrupt cardinals, courtesans, ambassadors, and nobles, The Pope's Rhinoceros is at once a fabulous adventure tale and a portrait of an age rushing headlong to its crisis.",

        "Title": "The Good Marriage: How and Why Love Lasts",
        "Authors": "By Blakeslee, Sandra and Wallerstein, Judith S.",
        "Description": "Ours is a culture of divorce, yet some couples have happy, long-lasting marriages. What is their secret? When so many marriages fail miserably, why do others succeed?This book has the answers. Judith Wallerstein, coauthor of Second Chances, the landmark bestseller on divorce, now turns her attention to marriages that work. Based on a groundbreaking study of fifty couples who consider themselves happily married, The Good Marriage offers an entirely fresh vision of that most complex of human relationships. Wallerstein describes what she considers the four basic types of marriage: romantic, rescue, companionate, and traditional. She identifies the natural stages of a marriage and explains the nine psychological tasks - including separating from the family of origin and making a safe place for conflict - that must be undertaken by anyone committed to having a good marriage.Wallerstein and coauthor Sandra Blakeslee introduce us to a number of couples who speak honestly and eloquently about the intimate interiors of their marriages. We meet Sara and Matt, whose passion for each other still burns strong many years after their first electrifying encounter; Helen and Keith, who discovered that marriage can heal the wounds of an unhappy childhood; Ellis and Janet, who each brought two children to their second marriage and made it work. Thanks to the astonishing candor of these couples, we learn a great deal about how partners in a good marriage overcome difficult obstacles, resolve the conflicts that come with parenting, and keep love alive despite the myriad pressures of modern life.The men and women interviewed by Wallerstein readily admit that even the best relationship requires hard work and continuing negotiation. But they also convey an inspirational message, for almost all of them feel that their marriage is their single greatest accomplishment. The Good Marriage explains why, and its lively mix of storytelling and analysis will challenge every couple to think in a profoundly different way about the most important relationship in their lives.",

        "Description": "Foreword by Tom PetersInternationally known management consultants Nicholas Imparato and Oren Harari connect the big picture of our changing civilizations with the specific practical actions that managers have to take to produce results today. All organizations are faced with the same challenge: the need to jump the curve to make significant, discontinuous leaps in their thinking, whether about product, technology, or management style. The alternative to follow current practices all the way to their inevitable decline is unacceptable. The authors show us that it is also unnecessary.Drawing on numerous personal interviews with innovative leaders around the world, as well as research and first-hand observation, Imparato and Harari identify the four strategic imperatives--innovation, intelligence, coherence, and responsibility--that will enable companies to successfully jump the curve and thrive in the emerging epoch. And they show how cutting-edge companies and leaders are translating these imperatives into action.Not since the dawn of the Modern Age some five hundred years ago has civilization undergone the kind of profound, rapid-fire changes we're experiencing today. Even organizations that are adapting, growing and innovating have the gnawing sense that obsolescence is right around the corner. Jumping the Curve offers perspective and guidance for doing business at this unique moment in time. It connects the big picture of our changing world with the practical actions managers must take now to position their organizations for success in a new epoch we can't yet fully see or understand.",

Often, even after a childhood teddy has been worn into a threadbare, shapeless lump, the affection it inspired still remains. There has been a great resurgence of interest in teddy bears both new and old - not just as objects of affection, but also as collector's items. Teddy bear shops have sprung up all over the country and there is even a teddy hospital at The House of Bruin in Loughborough, Leicestershire, where sick teddies can receive expert medical attention. As countless grown-ups know, teddy bears are not just for children.Teddy bears are the inspiration in this unique and fun collection of stories. With 23 stories in all, readers will find a wonderful variety, from mystery to humor and romance, to some amazing true stories. Read the fascinating story of how Margarete Steiff, a German dressmaker, got into the toy business by mistake. Her nephew decided to make a bear with moveable limbs made out of mohair, this inventing what soon was to be named by Americans the \"teddy bear\" after Teddy Roosevelt. Another story tells how a lucky teddy bear, unbeknownst to his unfortunate owner, became a survivor in the sinking of the Titanic. Whatever their theme, all the stories acknowledge the very special relationship that exists between a bear and its owner.Altogether, this is a perfect companion for all who believe that their relationship with teddy bears is too precious to end with childhood.",

        "Description": "Within a few minutes of the news that Grateful Dead leader Jerry Garcia had passed away, tributes to him began appearing on the Internet. Highly personal, sincere, and moving, these fans' voices form the heart of Not Fade Away. Some tell stories of meetings with Jerry or recall a favorite concert, others explain how his music changed their lives. The effect is of a communal oral history - told, of course, through the most current technology.Part of the appeal of the Dead has always been its community of followers and their unique relationship with the band, and it is fitting that this most personal tribute to Jerry should come from them.",

Just six months after her arrival on the West Coast and only weeks after she'd finally come into a challenging job... she discovered a small lump above her collarbone... As if a powerful switch had been thrown, her life veered, not out of control, but onto a different, scarier track where events speeded up and everyday existence was perilously heightened.\"So begins Douglas Hobbie's harrowing account of his daughter's struggle with Hodgkin's disease. From the beginning, and despite every shattering setback and disappointment in the course of her ordeal, Brett was determined to prevail.Finally, facing her death, she learned to live in the moment - radiantly - while discovering ways to express her pain and loss and her inextinguishable love of life. Being Brett is a record of courage and perseverance that pushes past the myths and unreality that often insulate us from death and dying.",

But rarely have his dramatic gifts been more effectively deployed than in Terminal.Despite a blue-collar background and Irish roots mistrustful of fancy degrees, highly motivated, enormously intelligent Sean Murphy has made it as far as his third year in Harvard's combined Ph.D./M.D. program when he makes a fateful decision to take a two-month research elective at the renowned Forbes Cancer Center in Miami. Sean is eager to study firsthand the Forbes Center's remarkable results treating medulloblastoma, a rare form of brain cancer. But his decision is also due, in no small part, to a budding romance with Janet Reardon, a nurse from a privileged and prominent Boston family. Unnerved by Janet's disturbing allure - and even more, by thoughts of commitment - Sean opts for the safety and distance of the prestigious clinic.But his plans at Forbes go awry from day one. First he is denied the opportunity to work on the medulloblastoma protocol. Then, to his surprise, Janet shows up at the medical center, having accepted a job - ostensibly to further her career but actually to pursue Sean.When a disgruntled Sean appears on the verge of heading home, Janet persuades him to stay by coming up with a plan: The two of them will investigate the medulloblastoma cases surreptitiously, she taking the clinical and he the research. By the time they uncover the truth about the clinic's seemingly ground-breaking cures, the pair run afoul of the law, their medical colleagues, and - perhaps worst of all - the powerful, enigmatic director of the Forbes Center, Dr. Randolph Mason.Drawing closer together at every hazardous turn, Sean and Janet discover a horror beyond their worst suspicions, one that makes a mockery of the Hippocratic oath. It is a truth so nefarious it could very well wind them up dead.Steeped in the latest discoveries of molecular medicine, reflective of the harsh realities of medical economies, Terminal is Robin Cook at his thrilling, thought-provoking best.",

He has always wondered just how far he could push his power. He is about to find out.Captain Ann Campbell is the daughter of General \"Fighting Joe\" Campbell. She is a West Point graduate, beautiful, bright, and the pride of Fort Hadley. Her raped and murdered body is found on the firing range, naked and spread-eagled, her hands and feet bound with tent rope - but there is no sign of a struggle. All of Brenner's instincts tell him to avoid the case. Yet Brenner's natural curiosity is aroused. He takes the case.As if that decision weren't reckless enough, he finds himself teamed with rape specialist Cynthia Sunhill, a woman with whom Brenner once had a tempestuous, ultimately doomed affair and with whom the temperamental sparks still flare. Together, they will discover the truth about the brass above them: that beneath the neatly pressed uniforms, the military codes of honor, pride, and order hide a corruption as rank as Ann Campbell's own astonishing secret life. Paul and Cynthia learn that any number of people were sexually, emotionally, and dangerously involved with the Army's \"golden girl,\" and any one of them could have wanted her dead.Far more than a richly plotted murder mystery, Nelson DeMille's The General's Daughter is a resonant and scathing portrayal of military life, demonstrating, unforgettably, how its members are different from - and at the same time, so much like - the rest of us.",

The idea was quintessential Clinton, the New Democrat trying to reclaim the moral authority of government, marrying \"rights\" and \"responsibilities.\"With the cooperation of more than fifty people intimately involved in the process - including the president himself - Waldman captures in vivid detail (and surprising humor) the struggle to revamp the college loan system and create the program now known as AmeriCorps. Because he was allowed to sit in on scores of private meetings, Waldman provides an unprecedented inside portrait of how Washington really works, one that is essential reading for even casual students of politics, economics, and history. For Americans who are interested in service or in an affordable college education, The Bill shows what happens when a policy designed to tap the best impulses of American citizens collides with a Washington culture that brings out their worst.",

Six American Poets includes 247 poems, among them such famous masterpieces as \"I Hear America Singing,\" \"The Idea of Order at Key West,\" \"The Dance,\" and \"Mending Wall,\" as well as lesser-known works. With perceptive introductory essays by the distinguished scholar Joel Conarroe and selections that capture the distinctive voices and visions of its authors, this volume is an invaluable addition to any poetry library.",

Two groups were studied: exercisers, who ate as much as usual but pedaled stationary bikes to burn off 360 calories a day; and dieters, who trimmed back their daily food consumption by 360 calories.Since both groups cut out 360 calories a day, you'd figure it would be a wash. Wrong. The final score: dieters, 4 1/2 pounds of fat lost; exercisers, 19 pounds of fat lost.The reason: Most of the weight lost by dieters was muscle, not fat. The exercisers not only lost fat but gained muscle. And lean body mass burns more calories than fat body mass. That means you can eat more without gaining weight.Surprised? There are many more awaiting you inside the pages of Fight Fat. From how to cook a romantic dinner to how to get started in golf, from how to snack smartly at work to how to burn more calories while sleeping, Fight Fat is your round-the-clock guide to the lean lifestyle.",

Now, with The Re-Enchantment of Everyday Life, Moore takes another radical step, applying the principles of caring for the soul to our surroundings and the concrete particulars of how we live. Starting from the premise that we can no longer afford to live in a disenchanted world, Moore shows that a profound, enchanted engagement with life is not a childish thing to be put away with adulthood but a necessity for our personal and collective survival.With his lens focused on such specific aspects of daily life as clothing, food, furniture, architecture, ecology, language, and politics, Moore describes the renaissance these can undergo when there is genuine engagement with beauty, craft, nature, and art in both private and public life. When all is said and done, what makes life worth living? Not electronics, entertainments, or rapid information retrieval, but a spiritual and soulful vision that arises from enchanted nature, a fantasy-filled childhood, intimate neighborhoods and homes, and a public life dedicated to the needs of the heart.",

        "Title": "Bordeaux: Revised Third Edition",
        "Authors": "By Parker, Robert M., Jr.",
        "Description": "When Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s Bordeaux was first published in 1985, it was greeted with tremendous enthusiasm by such legendary authorities as Hugh Johnson and Michael Broadbent. Time, Newsweek, Business Week, Esquire, and People magazines soon joined in the praise, and the book became a huge commercial and critical success. In England, it won the prestigious Glenfiddich award.  Since that time, Parker has published eight other books for wine lovers, many of which have received critical awards -- Burgundy, The Wines of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley and Provence, four editions of the Wine Buyer's Guide, The Wines of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, and an updated edition of Bordeaux in 1991 -- as well as his highly respected newsletter, The Wine Advocate, and bi-monthly columns in Food & Wine magazine. With each book, his audience has expanded to the point where not only American wine consumers but also those in France, England, Japan, Sweden, and Germany have quickly learned to trust his palate. In 1995, Parker became the first American in the wine field to receive La Croix du Chevalier de l'Ordre Nationale du M\u00e9rite (The Cross of the Knight of the National Order of Merit), one of France's two highest honors, conferred on him directly by President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. In 1998, he won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine and Spirits Professional. Clearly, it can be said that Robert Parker is America's foremost wine professional.  With this third edition of the classic that launched him, Parker strives to maintain his unprecedented independence, objectivity, clarity, and enthusiasm in reporting on the vintages of Bordeaux and provides the prodigious comprehensiveness for which he is known. Not only has he added tastings for the vintages in the intervening years between this and the last edition but he has also retasted and reevaluated many earlier vintages. His accessible and direct style welcomes both the seasoned wine collector and the eager beginner to the pleasures of fine wine and France's most illustrious ch\u00e2teaux.  Organized by appellation, Bordeaux moves alphabetically from one producer to the next, providing essential information and an overview of the property and its owners, listing each vintage, and including numerical ratings and detailed tasting notes of most of that chateau's wines for the past thirty-seven years. At the end of each tasting note, Parker estimates the \"anticipated maturity\" -- the range of time when the wine should peak in flavor and balance -- and each entry concludes with a summary of the chateau's older vintages. Throughout these extensive commentaries and tasting notes, there is never a doubt that this is the most complete consumer's guide to the wines of Bordeaux ever written.  Who is making Bordeaux's best and worst wines? What has a specific ch\u00e2teau's track record been over the last thirty or forty years? What ch\u00e2teaux are overrated and overpriced? Which are underrated or underpriced? Always with an eye toward the consumer, Parker distinguishes true value from perceived value.  While the bulk of the book is given over to these ratings, the opening and closing chapters of the book provide readers with a true sense of the changes in the region and its vintages. Such critical issues as: Who most influences winemaking styles?, What role does technology play in modern wine production?, and What impact do second labels have on the quality of the first? are tackled here. Parker also lovingly describes the growing conditions in the region year by year, spending considerable time discussing the 1995 vintage, which he terms \"the most consistently top-notch vintage since 1990.\" In addition to this, Parker reassesses the Bordeaux Classifications, the effects of the soil on the grapes, and the different winemaking processes. He then rounds out this incredible volume with a User's Guide to Bordeaux Wines, practical travel and dining information for wine-touring trips, a complete glossary of terminology, and a quick reference index of the entire book.  As the first book to discuss the 1995, 1996, and 1997 vintages in detail -- vintages that are being hailed as the Best of the Century -- the third edition of Bordeaux is the best tool to use in making both purchasing and consuming decisions.

        "Description": "In 1995, during the term of the president we elect now, our United States, for all practical purposes, will have spent itself into bankruptcy. This year, interest on the national debt is likely to become the largest item in the federal budget, topping the enormous Pentagon and Social Security budgets. In a few short years, the government will have to spend more to make its interest payments than it will collect in taxes, and in that year America will enter an age of financial disaster that will dwarf the Great Depression and hail the end of the United States as we now know it.This timely book, by cost-reduction expert, industrialist, and entrepreneur Harry E. Figgie, Jr., explains, in plain English and as no book has done before, exactly how we got into this disgraceful mess through the failure of our timid political leaders to act with courage and resolve, how there is no escape from economic ruin for our great nation without immediate and drastic change, and what national bankruptcy will mean for every one of us, rich or poor. Most important, it provides us with a detailed plan of action, a way out of these dire straits, if we can summon the will to act now, and to force our leaders to act. Bankruptcy 1995 is a vital call to arms at a moment of great crisis for our nation.",
