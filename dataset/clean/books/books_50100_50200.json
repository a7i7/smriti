        "Title": "The Sweet Potato Queens: Stuff We Didn't Actually Do, But Could Have, And May Yet",
        "Authors": "By Browne, Jill Conner and Gillespie, Karin (CON)",
        "Description": "\"I have no pride. I tell anything,\" Jill Conner Browne is fond of saying. As Her Royal Highness, Boss Queen of the Sweet Potato Queens\u00ae, she has told legions of fans, known as \"SPQ Wannabes,\" her delectable secrets to living, loving -- and eating -- like a queen. In her words, \"More is more.\"   How much more? The #1 New York Times bestselling author of five works of nonfiction now serves up The Sweet Potato Queens' First Big-Ass Novel: Stuff We Didn't Actually Do, but Could Have, and May Yet. The humor in this uproarious coming-of-queen novel is more delicious than a favorite dessert (the Queens favor Chocolate Stuff&#153;, of course).   In Jackson, Mississippi, Mary Bennett, Patsy, Gerald, and Jill are high school classmates whose daily routine is paced like a shuffle through the local red dirt -- until the arrival of a redheaded newcomer banishes monotony forever. With her luxurious mane and voluptuous figure, Tammy Myers aspires to join the silver-spooners, who make things happen in their lives. When Jill convinces Tammy and the others that money might buy a certain kind of good time and that true friendship has no price tag, the \"Sweet Potato Queens\" are born. \"If it ain't fun, we ain't doin' it,\" runs their official club motto, and the Queens are true to their word.   Together, the Queens laugh out loud as they step down the long -- and not altogether pretty -- road toward making their very own queen dust, the sparkle that comes from livin' and lovin' their own lives. The Sweet Potato Queens' First Big-Ass Novel: Stuff We Didn't Actually Do, but Could Have, and May Yet reveals that the journey isn't always easy, but in the company of the Queens, you can sparkle, too.",

        "Title": "Apart from the Crowd",
        "Authors": "By McPartlin, Anna",
        "Description": "In a little Irish town like Kenmare, there's no need to worry whether people will discover your secrets. They already have.   For Mary, that means being remembered for her tragic losses, even if she'd rather get on with her life. For her cousin Ivan, as close as a brother, the gossip is all about how his wife took the kids and ran off with her new lover. For Mary's friend Penny, it's an old romance that didn't work out quite right, and a current affair with a bottle of vodka.   Then Sam Sullivan rents the cottage next door to Mary, and within hours the whole town is talking about the film-star-handsome American. When Sam hurts his back while helping his new neighbor and spends the next week confined to a mattress on her floor, gossip runs rampant. But neither Kenmare nor Mary know about the secrets Sam is so successfully hiding....   For Mary's circle of friends, Sam's arrival marks more than one change. And Mary -- whose unlucky history has kept her apart from the crowd much of her life -- has finally found a man with whom she feels she might truly connect. But so long as both are captive to memories they dare not reveal, the past is a barrier that will keep them forever alone.   In this powerful novel, Anna McPartlin perfectly captures the drama, the emotion, and the laughter of a small Irish community, for those who fit in -- and those who don't. Apart from the Crowd mixes wit and insight to create an engrossing tale that will keep you reading to the very last page.",

Itwould also give her the chance to show those peoplewho shunned her that she could be successful. Peoplewere getting rich. They owned property, money,business, and cars. With new freedom and opportunitiescame new crimes. There would be much thatshe could do.\"Present day, Beijing. Mei Wang is a modern, independent woman. She has her own apartment. She owns a car. She has her own business with that most modern of commodities -- a male secretary. Her short career with China's prestigious Ministry for Public Security has given her intimate insight into the complicated and arbitrary world of Beijing's law enforcement. But it is her intuition, curiosity, and her uncanny knack for listening to things said -- and unsaid -- that make Mei Beijing's first successful female private investigator.Mei is no stranger to the dark side of China. She was six years old when she last saw her father behind the wire fence of one of Mao's remote labor camps. Perhaps as a result, Mei eschews the power plays and cultural mores -- guanxi -- her sister and mother live by...for better and for worse.Mei's family friend \"Uncle\" Chen hires her to find a Han dynasty jade of great value: he believes the piece was looted from the Luoyang Museum during the Cultural Revolution -- when the Red Guards swarmed the streets, destroying so many traces of the past -- and that it's currently for sale on the black market. The hunt for the eye of jade leads Mei through banquet halls and back alleys, seedy gambling dens and cheap noodle bars near the Forbidden City. Given the jade's provenance and its journey, Mei knows to treat the investigation as a most delicate matter; she cannot know, however, that this case will force her to delve not only into China's brutal history, but also into her family's dark secrets and into her own tragic separation from the man she loved in equal parts.The first novel in an exhilarating new detective series, The Eye of Jade is both a thrilling mystery and a sensual and fascinating journey through modern China.",

        "Authors": "By Viorst, Judith and Gibson, Laura (ILT)",
        "Description": "Whatever became of Alexander after that famously bad day? And did you know that Judith Viorst is his mother? And what happens to her passion for household neatness and orderliness, her deep devotion to schedules, her compulsive yearning to offer helpful advice when Alexander -- now grown up, married, and the father of three -- moves his family into his parents' house? What happens is controlled, and sometimes not so controlled, chaos, as lives and routines are turned upside down and the house is overrun with scattered toys, pacifiers, baby bottles, sippy cups, pink-sequined flip-flops, jigsaw puzzles, and fishy crackers.   With her characteristic sparkle and wit, Viorst relates her efforts to (graciously) share space, to become (if only a little bit) more flexible, to (sort of) keep her opinions to herself, and even to eventually figure out how to unlock the safety locks of the baby's (expletives deleted) bouncy seat. She describes how she and her husband, while sometimes longing for the former peace and tranquillity of unravished rooms and quiet dinners for two unaccompanied by cries of \"Oh, yuck!\" survived and relished the extended visit of the Alexander Five. She also opens our eyes to the joys of multigenerational family living and to the unexpected opportunities to grow that life presents -- even under the most unlikely circumstances.  Several generations of readers surely will relate to this funny and loving book, enhanced throughout by Laura Gibson's delightful two-color drawings.",

At Figs, which was voted Best Italian Restaurant by USA Today and cited by Boston magazine and Zagat's as having the best pizza in Boston, there's something for everyone in the family, from Macaroni Simoni for the kids, to Portobello Mushrooms, Mushroom Pur\u00e9e, and Fontina Cheese Pizza for more sophisticated palates. And no one will turn down a taste of the White-Chocolate Challah Pudding with Caramel Sauce.  Everyone loves pizza, and at Figs, pizza is the main attraction. But that's not all you'll find in these pages. The Figs Table showcases Todd English's trademark style: layering flavors to create bold and soulful food, now available to the home cook.

Couscous Carbonara with Country Ham is a new twist on an old favorite; Spaghetti with Hazelnuts and Green Beans makes a simple but elegant supper. And why not try Creamy Cheddar and Spinach Polenta or the Asparagus Butter Risotto with Shrimp as a change from pasta? And of course, there's the pizza: White Bean Hummus and Asiago; Fig and Prosciutto; Clam; Spicy Shrimp Pizza with Caramelized Leeks and Tomato Sauce; Classico; even Kielbasa, Sauerkraut, and Potato Pizza with Dijon Mustard Aloli. And for just a taste of something sweet, try a Cranberry Pecan Biscotti, a slice of Torta Caprese, or the Tiramisu that The Boston Phoenix called \"the best in town.\"  Simple or complex, sweet or savory, any dish from The Figs Table makes any meal special.",

        "Title": "Planet India: The Turbulent Rise of the Largest Democracy and the Future of Our World",
        "Authors": "By Kamdar, Mira",
        "Description": "India is everywhere: on magazine covers and cinema marquees, at the gym and in the kitchen, in corporate boardrooms and on Capitol Hill. Through incisive reportage and illuminating analysis, Mira Kamdar explores India's astonishing transformation from a developing country into a global powerhouse. She takes us inside India, reporting on the people, companies, and policies defining the new India and revealing how it will profoundly affect our future -- financially, culturally, politically.   The world's fastest-growing democracy, India has the youngest population on the planet, and a middle class as big as the population of the entire United States. Its market has the potential to become the world's largest. As one film producer told Kamdar when they met in New York, \"Who needs the American audience? There are only 300 million people here.\" Not only is India the ideal market for the next new thing, but with a highly skilled English-speaking workforce, elite educational institutions, and growing foreign investment, India is emerging as an innovator of the technology that is driving the next phase of the global economy.   While India is celebrating its meteoric rise, it is also racing against time to bring the benefits of the twenty-first century to the 800 million Indians who live on less than two dollars per day, to find the sustainable energy to fuel its explosive economic growth, and to navigate international and domestic politics to ensure India's security and its status as a global power. India is the world in microcosm: the challenges it faces are universal -- from combating terrorism, poverty, and disease to protecting the environment and creating jobs. The urgency of these challenges for India is spurring innovative solutions, which will catapult it to the top of the new world order. If India succeeds, it will not only save itself, it will save us all. If it fails, we will all suffer. As goes India, so goes the world.   Mira Kamdar tells the dramatic story of a nation in the midst of redefining itself and our world. Provocative, timely, and essential, Planet India is the groundbreaking book that will convince Americans just how high the stakes are -- what there is to lose, and what there is to gain from India's meteoric rise.    DID YOU KNOW? ? India is the world's fourth-largest economy. ? By 2034, India will be the most populous country on Earth, with 1.6 billion people. ? India's middle class is already larger than the entire population of the United States. ? One out of three of the world's malnourished children live in India. ? India is home to the biggest youth population on earth: 600 million people are under the age of 25. ? 72,000,000 cell phones will be sold in India in 2007. ? India just edged past the United States to become the second-most-preferred destination for foreign direct investment after China. ? In 1991, Indians purchased 150,000 automobiles; in 2007, they are expected to purchase 10 million. ? By 2008, India's total pool of qualified graduates will be more than twice as large as China's. ? By 2015, an estimated 3.5 million white-collar U.S. jobs will be offshored. ? India is the largest arms importer in the developing world. ? American corporations expect to earn $20 to $40 billion from the civilian nuclear agreement with India. ? In 2007, there are 2.2 million Indian Americans, a number expected to double every decade. ? Twenty-nine percent of India's population speaks English -- that's 350 million people.",

But her magic didn't come with a warning label, and while she's burning up the sheets every night with her sexy sandman, her love spell has consequences she didn't expect....",

        "Authors": "By Walker, June",
        "Description": "June Walker tackles the most vexing problems facing the self-employed: bad recordkeeping and tax ignorance. Her solutions are simple, quick and audit proof: a recordkeeping method that works and a guide through the tax maze that ends with more money in the indie's pocket and less money going to Uncle Sam. The self-employed operate under various names -- sole proprietors, freelancers, subcontractors, free agents, independent professionals - but the IRS and other taxing authorities require all of them to follow the same rules. If self-employed people don't understand tax and recordkeeping fundamentals, they will eventually gum up the works, and the remedy will be expensive, time-consuming, worrisome, and possibly fatal to their businesses - no matter how talented, motivated and entrepreneurial they are. The author creates characters such as wedding photographer Billy Bridesnapper and the clueless CPA Sammy Segar to illustrate situations based on the real experiences of her clients. Through these examples told in clear, crisp and simple prose she explains the complete range of tax and recordkeeping basics - like how to prove to the IRS that the endeavor is a business not a hobby, how start-up costs differ from other deductions, how to go snorkeling and still deduct travel expenses, why a gift to mom can be a legitimate business deduction,  why solos needn't worry about the difference between income and a reimbursement, how to make estimated tax payments,  the structure and advantages of sole proprietorship, and hundreds of vital details about taxes, finances, and recordkeeping.  Armed with June's unique copyrighted worksheets designed just for the indie, her system takes only a few hours a year to implement, and saves time, anxiety and stress. Even the beginner who has never kept business records can easily learn it. Self Employed Tax Solutions explains how not to miss one single business deduction, how to pay the least tax legitimately possible and how to keep records so that accounting and tax preparer fees are reduced. Self-Employed Tax Solutions is not written for dummies but for bright, intelligent people who don't understand the business side of their solo ventures. It's the one indispensable book that self-employed people need to survive and to succeed in a business environment where the tax laws and regulations are structured not for them but for corporations and employees.",

        "Authors": "By Nagel, Paul C.",
        "Description": "In The Lees of Virginia, Paul Nagel chronicles seven generations of Lees, from the family founder Richard to General Robert E. Lee, covering over two hundred years of American history. We meet Thomas Lee, who dreamed of America as a continental empire. His daughter was Hannah Lee Corbin, a non-conformist in lifestyle and religion, while his son, Richard Henry Lee, was a tempestuous figure who wore black silk over a disfigured hand when he made the motion in Congress for Independence.  Another of Thomas' sons, Arthur Lee, created a political storm by his accusations against Benjamin Franklin. Arthur's cousin was Light-Horse Harry Lee, a controversial cavalry officer in the Revolutionary War, whose wild real estate speculation led to imprisonment for debt and finally self-exile in the Caribbean. One of Harry's sons, Henry Lee, further disgraced the family by seducing his sister-in-law and frittering away Stratford, the Lees' ancestral home. Another son, however, became the family's redeeming figure--Robert E. Lee, a brilliant tactician who is still revered for his lofty character and military success.  In these and numerous other portraits, Nagel discloses how, from 1640 to 1870, a family spirit united the Lees, making them a force in Virginian and American affairs.        Paul Nagel is a leading chronicler of families prominent in our history. His Descent from Glory, a masterful narrative account of four generations of Adamses, was hailed by The New Yorker as \"intelligent, tactful, and spiritually generous,\" and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian W.A. Swanberg, in the Chicago Sun-Times, called it \"a magnificent embarrassment of biographical riches.\"  Now, in The Lees of Virginia, Nagel brings his skills to bear on another major American family, taking readers inside the great estates of the Old Dominion and the turbulent lives of the Lee men and women.",

        "Description": "A witty and razor-sharp look at the many ways our individually rational decisions can combine into some truly weird collective results\u2014and some hilarious and serious ways to fix just about everything.Economics is no longer the \u201cdismal science\u201d dreaded by college freshmen. In recent years, a band of economists has broken away from the charts and graphs of college textbooks, and begun to explain ordinary behavior in plain and often entertaining English. Steve Landsburg was one of the first of the new breed, in his book The Armchair Economist and long-running \u201cEveryday Economics\u201d column in Slate magazine. Now he is back, and more provocative than ever. In More Sex Is Safer Sex, Landsburg shows how the rational behavior of each one of us\u2014when combined together\u2014produces the often bizarre, seemingly irrational behavior of crowds. We all stand up at the ballpark, so none of us can see. We avoid casual sex, from fear of disease, and we thereby make sex more dangerous. Things really get interesting when Landsburg suggests ways to change the rules, and game the system. Why not charge juries if a convicted felon is exonerated? Why not have each member of Congress represent a national subset of voters, chosen alphabetically? Why not solve the \u201coverpopulation\u201d problem by having more children, who will help think of ways to improve our use of resources? More Sex Is Safer Sex will make you laugh and argue\u2014and it will make you think about the world around you in new and unforgettable ways.",

        "Description": "Danielle Steel, America\u2019s number-one best-selling novelist, has held millions spell-bound  with such novels as Family Album, Full Circle, and Changes. But with Secrets she  takes her readers beyond the tightly knit world of the family, into the heart of  the nation\u2019s most glamorous industry: television.  Here is the drama behind the creation  of Manhattan, a first-of-its-kind prime-time television series produced by Melvin  Wechsler. Tempered by tragedy, seasoned by success, a man with a Midas touch, Mel  Wechsler will assemble a dazzling cast:  Sabina Quarles at forty-five has managed  to maintain\u2013by dint of spunk and surgery\u2013the body of an eighteen-year-old. Tough,  spirited, and self-sufficient, she has survived twenty years in Hollywood, never  marrying, never quite succeeding, never deigning to work in television.  Yet Manhattan may bring her both the stardom she craves\u2013and the security her very special needs  require.  Jane Adams is an earthy thirty-nine-year-old beauty.  Devoted to her children,  dominated by her abusive and violent husband, forced to choose between her husband  and her acting career, Jane may find that her role in Manhattan has cost her everything  that matters most.   Zack Taylor, the leading man, is a paragon of professionalism.   Yet beyond the smooth good looks, the easy warmth, and the slick charm of the eligible  bachelor, he remains an enigma.  The charming ingenue, Gabrielle Thornton-Smith,  seems to have appeared out of the blue. Beautiful, talented and on the brink of success  at twenty-five, what can she have to hide?  And Bill Warwick, plucked from the ranks  of struggling young actors, is now slated to be the nation\u2019s new heartthrob.  But  he has lied about one issue in his background. Not only will Bill\u2019s future hang in  the balance, but the success of the whole series may be jeopardized when he is forced  publicly to confront the consequences of his little white lie.  Set in Los Angeles  and New York, Secrets carries the reader behind the scenes into the making of a major  television series. Probing even deeper beneath the polished surfaces, Danielle Steel  explores the dilemmas both men and women, in and out of the searchlight of the media,  confront today. She paints a vivid, compelling picture of a sophisticated world and  the surprisingly real problems of the people who inhabit it.  Here Danielle Steel  delineates her richest and most complex cast of characters, people forced together  by extraordinary circumstances who must perform even when they're torn apart by their  deepest secrets.",

In March 1943, a team of expatriate Norwegian commandos sailed from northern England for Nazi-occupied arctic Norway to organize and supply the Norwegian resistance. But they were betrayed and the Nazis ambushed them. Only one man survived--Jan Baalsrud. This is the incredible and gripping story of his escape.Frostbitten and snowblind, pursued by the Nazis, he dragged himself on until he reached a small arctic village. He was near death, delirious, and a virtual cripple. But the villagers, at mortal risk to themselves, were determined to save him, and--through impossible feats--they did.We Die Alone is an astonishing true story of heroism and endurance. Like Slavomir Rawicz's The Long Walk, it is also an unforgettable portrait of the determination of the human spirit.",

        "Authors": "By Zweig, Michael",
        "Description": "The United States is not a middle class society. Michael Zweig shows that the majority of Americans are actually working class and argues that recognizing this fact is essential if that majority is to achieve political influence and social strength. \"Class,\" Zweig writes, \"is primarily a matter of power, not income.\" He goes beyond old formulations of class to explore ways in which class interacts with race and gender.Defining \"working class\" as those who have little control over the pace and content of their work and who do not supervise others, Zweig warns that by allowing this class to disappear into categories of middle class or consumers, we also allow those with the dominant power, capitalists, to vanish among the rich. Economic relations then appear as comparisons of income or lifestyle rather than as what they truly are\u2014contests of power, at work and in the larger society.Using personal interviews, solid research, and down-to-earth examples, Zweig looks at a number of important contemporary social problems: the growing inequality of income and wealth, welfare reform, globalization, the role of government, and the family values debate. He shows how, with class in mind, our understanding of these issues undergoes a radical shift.Believing that we must limit the power of capitalists to abuse workers, communities, and the environment, Zweig offers concrete ideas for the creation of a new working class politics in the United States.",

For the first time in human history, he observes, \"more\" is no longer synonymous with \"better\"\u2014indeed, for many of us, they have become almost opposites. McKibben puts forward a new way to think about the things we buy, the food we eat, the energy we use, and the money that pays for it all. Our purchases, he says, need not be at odds with the things we truly value.McKibben's animating idea is that we need to move beyond \"growth\" as the paramount economic ideal and pursue prosperity in a more local direction, with cities, suburbs, and regions producing more of their own food, generating more of their own energy, and even creating more of their own culture and entertainment. He shows this concept blossoming around the world with striking results, from the burgeoning economies of India and China to the more mature societies of Europe and New England. For those who worry about environmental threats, he offers a route out of the worst of those problems; for those who wonder if there isn't something more to life than buying, he provides the insight to think about one's life as an individual and as a member of a larger community.McKibben offers a realistic, if challenging, scenario for a hopeful future. Deep Economy makes the compelling case that the more we nurture the essential humanity of our economy, the more we will recapture our own.",

        "Description": "In April 2002, Janine Latus's youngest sister, Amy, wrote a note and taped it to the inside of her desk drawer. Today Ron Ball and I are romantically involved, it read, but I fear I have placed myself at risk in a variety of ways. Based on his criminal past, writing this out just seems like the smart thing to do. If I am missing or dead this obviously has not protected me...   That same spring Janine Latus was struggling to leave her marriage -- a marriage to a handsome and successful man. A marriage others emulated. A marriage in which she felt she could do nothing right and everything wrong. A marriage in which she felt afraid, controlled, inadequate, and trapped.   Ten weeks later, Janine Latus had left her marriage. She was on a business trip to the East Coast, savoring her freedom, attending a work conference, when she received a call from her sister Jane asking if she'd heard from Amy. Immediately, Janine's blood ran cold. Amy was missing.   Helicopters went up and search dogs went out. Coworkers and neighbors and family members plastered missing posters with Amy's picture across the county. It took more than two weeks to find Amy's body, wrapped in a tarpaulin and buried at a building site. It took nearly two years before her killer, her former boyfriend Ron Ball, was sentenced for her murder.   Amy died in silent fear and pain. Haunted by this, Janine Latus turned her journalistic eye inward. How, she wondered, did two seemingly well-adjusted, successful women end up in strings of physically or emotionally abusive relationships with men? If I Am Missing or Dead is a heart-wrenching journey of discovery as Janine Latus traces the roots of her own -- and her sister's -- victimization with unflinching candor. This beautifully written memoir will move readers from the first to the last page. At once a confession, a call to break the cycle of abuse, and a deeply felt love letter to her baby sister, Amy Lynne Latus, If I Am Missing or Dead is an unforgettable read.",

The illusion seems part political hocus-pocus and also part wishful thinking, for among many Russians Stalin is again popular; the bloody dictator can boast a two-to-one approval rating. Decidedly better than that of Renko, whose lover, Eva, has left him for Detective Nikolai Isakov, a charismatic veteran of the civil war in Chechnya, a hero of the far right and, Renko suspects, a killer for hire. The cases entwine, and Renko's quests become a personal inquiry fueled by jealousy. The investigation leads to the fields of Tver outside of Moscow, where once a million soldiers fought. There, amidst the detritus, Renko must confront the ghost of his own father, a favorite general of Stalin's.

        "Authors": "By Dent, Harry S.",
        "Description": "For over fifteen years, New York Times bestselling author Harry S. Dent, Jr., has been uncannily accurate in predicting the financial future. In his three previous works, Dent predicted the financial recession of the early nineties, the economic expansion of the mid-nineties, and the financial free-for-all of 1998-2000.  The Next Great Bubble Boom -- part crystal ball, part financial planner -- offers a comprehensive forecast for the next two decades, showing new models for predicting the future behavior of the economy, inflation, large- and small-cap stocks, bonds, key sectors, and so on. In taking a look at past booms and busts, Dent compares our current state to that of the crash of 1920-21, and the years ahead of us to the Roaring Twenties. Dent gives advice on everything from investment strategies to real estate cycles, and shows not only how bright our future will be but how best to profit from it.  Dent gives us all something to look forward to, including:   The Dow hitting 40,000 by the end of the decade The Nasdaq advancing at least ten times from its October 2001 lows to around 13,500, and potentially as high as 20,000 by 2009 Another strong advance in stocks in 2005, with a significant correction into around September/October 2006 The Great Boom resurging into its final and strongest stage in 2007, and even more fully in 2008, lasting until late 2009 to early 2010   Dent's amazing ability to track and forecast our financial future is renowned, and here he takes that ability to the next level, showing not only what our economy will look like but also how it will affect us as individuals, as organizations, and as a culture. From the upcoming wealth revolution to the essential principles of entrepreneurial success, the book describes a new society where economic and philanthropic development go hand in hand.  In The Next Great Bubble Boom, Dent shows not only how the economic growth of the late 1990s was a prelude to the true great boom right around the corner but how all of us can reap its benefits.",

        "Description": "Although George Bush and Dick Cheney appear on the cover of this book in obvious reference to their scare-mongering considering terrorism and the nonexistent threat of Iraq, Catherwood (a historian affiliated with Churchill College Cambridge and Homerton College in the UK) and DiVanna (a UK-based economist and business consultant) argue that fear is an underlying characteristic of the American culture that has always been present as a legitimized mechanism for government control and economic activity. They connect the post-9/11 era of fear to previous fear-creating events like McCarthyism, the launching of Sputnik, and the Cold War and examine the similar role played by the media in exploiting fear in each of these cases. They present evidence that the United States has been involved in a historical cycle in which fear is used to justify armed interventions at times when the economy is slumping and warn against the decay in the American social fabric that has resulted from this cycle. Finally, they look to the example of the rise and fall of the British Empire and other great powers to consider the possible trends in this continuing use of fear to promote political, military, and economic objectives.

        "Description": "Sixty-million years ago dinosaurs were driven to extinction by global climatic changes, making way, in the process, for the small, more adaptable, warm-blooded mammals. Similarly, in the new economic climate of the 1980s and '90s, small business owners and entrepreneurs are quickly becoming the dominant business species. While the floundering corporate giants continue to lay off workers at a rate of 400,000 annually, small businesses create millions of new jobs each year - a trend, most experts agree, that will continue well into the 21st century.In The Portable MBA in Entrepreneurship, you'll find out how top business schools are preparing students to meet the challenges of the entrepreneurial-driven business climate of the 1990s and beyond. William Bygrave, a successful entrepreneur and Director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at Babson College, has brought together an all-star team of thinkers and doers to offer both established and aspiring entrepreneurs this comprehensive, highly practical guide. They include professors, consultants, and entrepreneurs - most of them successful business people, in addition to being first-class academics. Over the course of fourteen chapters, these experts cover all the angles, including how to tell if you've got the \"right stuff\" to be a success; start-up strategies; spotting market opportunities, marketing, and advertising; getting financing and managing debt; preparing business plans; managing a growing business and strategies for growth; legal and tax issues every small business person and entrepreneur should know; protecting intellectual property; and much more.Amazingly, while The Portable MBA in Entrepreneurship brings you the collective wisdom of some of the top guns in the academic and business worlds, it requires no background or academic prerequisites. Featuring solid, substantive information written in an interesting and engaging style, this book is your golden opportunity to get a state-of-the-art education in entrepreneurship in your spare time and at a tiny fraction of the cost of an MBA program.",

        "Description": "In a recent Gallup Poll, 50 percent of CEOs surveyed consider service/quality to be the single most important business issue their organizations face. North American businesses confront fierce competition from abroad and continue to lose market share. A growing number of companies, governments, and institutions are turning to service/quality improvement, or total quality management, to succeed in these turbulent times. But many organizations are floundering and failing to effectively implement these powerful new management methods.Firing on All Cylinders gives you a practical map for improving service and quality within your organization. You'll find thought-provoking questions that help you analyze what components are amiss within your organization so you and your management team remove quality improvement roadblocks. Jim Clemmer provides essential implementation checklists, \"how-to\" tips, and deployment processes so you can use Achieve International's Service/Quality System to guide your company's continuous quality improvement journey.Achieve's Service/Quality System is used by dozens of health care, public and private sector organizations, such as American Express, IBM - Canada, and Black & Decker. It combines three formerly separate organizational performance fields - customer service, organization development, and quality improvement - to help management teams take a broader, system-wide approach to long-term performance improvement.At the heart of this highly effective system are 12 key service/quality improvement areas or \"cylinders\" that include skill building, signaling commitment, systems and process management, standards and measures, listening to internal/external customers, reward and recognition, education and awareness, marketing strategies, and hiring and orienting. Clemmer outlines the fundamental steps for improving performance for each cylinder and incorporates a number of brief, \"real-life\" examples of what numerous organizations have done to achieve top performance. He also outlines how to avoid common implementation pitfalls and traps.Firing on All Cylinders also answers such fundamental deployment questions as: who should be involved?, how does your organization build the commitment of the vital frontline people who will ultimately carry out the improvement plans?, and how can you ensure that the Service/Quality System doesn't become just another \"program of the month\"?This comprehensive, clearly organized strategy for implementing a continuous quality improvement process will help you and your management team fine tune your organizational engine and increase performance!",
