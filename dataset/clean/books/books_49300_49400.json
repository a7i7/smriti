        "Title": "The Trouble With Perfect: How Parents Can Avoid the Over-Achievement Trap and Still Raise Successful Children",
        "Authors": "By Matthews, Kathy and Guthrie, Elisabeth, M.D.",
        "Description": "As competitive parenting has been on the rise since the 1980s, so have rates of teen suicide, eating disorders, depression, and drug use. Yet the cycle of \"push parenting\" doesn\u2019t show signs of slowing down. Our children today are competing with classmates who began listening to Mozart in utero and were enrolled in educational classes at ages two and three.  Under these circumstances, parents feel that they cannot afford to opt out, or let their children opt out.  What might become of them if they did?Alarmed by the high numbers of unmotivated, burned-out youngsters seeking her psychiatric treatment, Dr. Elisabeth Guthrie set out to uncover not just the sources of their distress but also the factors that drive parents to pressure their children. Dr. Guthrie explores our confounding culture of overachievement and takes a sympathetic look at the pervasive guilt that accompanies raising children today.Drawing on more than fifteen years of clinical experience, Dr. Guthrie outlines why the very intentions behind competitive parenting actually produce the opposite of the desired effect.  For the parent who expects a barely potty-trained toddler to begin learning a second language or a first grader to excel at a nightly battery of extracurricular activities, The Trouble with Perfect presents evidence that placing unreasonable expectations on children can actually deter their chances for success later in life. Such pressure can snuff out crucial qualities such as curiosity, spontaneity, and resourcefulness. When children are pushed, the message parents send to them on a daily basis is that they are not capable of making responsible choices by themselves, that appearances are more important than authenticity, that it is less important for them to own their experiences than to hold a significant title.  Helping parents discover the fine line between good parenting and pressure parenting, Dr. Guthrie also cites clear ways to address the guilt and societal issues that define the average child (by definition the majority!) as \"less-than-perfect\" or a \u201closer.\u201d With tips for enhancing the development of every child\u2019s unique set of talents, the book is a vital reality check for anyone concerned about what\u2019s really best for kids.",

        "Authors": "By Kagan, Donald and Kagan, Frederick W.",
        "Description": "In While England Slept Winston Churchill revealed in 1938 how the inadequacy of Britain's military forces to cope with worldwide responsibilities in a peaceful but tense era crippled its ability to deter or even adequately prepare for World War II.In While America Sleeps, historians Donald and Frederick W. Kagan retrace Britain's international and defense policies during the years after World War I leading up to World War II, showing how self-delusion and an unwillingness to face the inescapable responsibilities on which their security and the peace of the world depended cost the British dearly. The Kagans then turn their attention to America and argue that our nation finds itself in a position similar to that of Britain in the 1920s. For all its emergency interventions the U.S. has not yet accepted its unique responsibility to take the lead in preserving the peace. Years of military cutbacks\u2014the \"peace dividend\" following the buildup and triumph over Communism of the Reagan years\u2014have weakened our armed forces and left us with too few armed forces to cover too many possible threats. This has caused us to bank everything on high tech \"smart\" weapons\u2014some of which have not yet been invented and others that we are not acquiring or deploying\u2014as opposed to the long-term commitment of money, fighting men and women, and planning that the deterrence of a major war would require. This failure to shape a policy and to commit the resources needed to maintain peace has cost valuable time in shaping a peaceful world and has placed America's long-term security in danger. The policies of the Bush and Clinton administrations have left us in a position where we cannot avoid war and keep the peace in areas vital to our security. Neither have the post-Cold War policies sent clear signals to would-be aggressors that the U.S. can and will resist them. Tensions in the Middle East, instability in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan, the development of nuclear weapons and missile by North Korea, and the menacing threats and actions of China, with its immense population, resentful sense of grievance and years of military buildup, all hint that the current peaceful era will not last forever. Can we make it last as long as possible? Are we prepared to face its collapse?While America Sleeps is a sobering work of history that poses a thoughtful challenge to policy-makers.",

Penetrating, for the first time, the incredible web of half-truths and sexual blackmail used by Orsini to stay - for months and months - a half step ahead of the law, Lyons adds a compelling character to the annals of criminal reporting.This is a story that once started cannot easily be put down.",

Where did our sense of determination go?Our political, journalistic, and cultural leaders have mounted a campaign to oppose and impede the war on terror that seemed so vital in that rare moment of clarity. This book is my personal cri du coeur about deception in politics, journalism, and business\u2014especially when it stops us from following through on the work 9/11 has left for us all to do.This book takes on some pretty sacred cows, but it's about time they became fair game.\u2014from the IntroductionAre you appalled by the antiwar tone the news media has taken since the war on terror began\u2014especially \"objective\" news outlets like the New York Times and the network news?Are you wondering when liberal celebrities like Barbara Streisand, Sean Penn, and Susan Sarandon suddenly became geopolitical oracles whose advice we're supposed to value above the wisdom of tenured experts?Are you at a loss to decide who has betrayed us more outrageously: the French who abandoned us in our time of need, or our own elected officials, who tapped our 401(k) savings and the tobacco-settlement windfall with equal abandon?In Off with Their Heads, syndicated columnist and Fox News Cannel political analyst Dick Morris points an accusing finger at the many ways the public has been lied to and misled, pickpocketed and endangered. Whether it's Bill Clinton, who ignored mounting evidence of impending terrorist catastrophe throughout the 1990s, or the members of Congress, who quietly sold our democracy down the river in exchange for lifetime incumbency, Morris rips the cover off the cowardly and duplicitous figures who have sacrificed America's interests for their own.From private corruption to public treachery, even longtime political buffs will marvel at the astonishing behavior Morris reveals at every level of society\u2014and at how it threatens to compromise the American way of life.",

Summoned back to Saigon, Wingo is ordered to kill a local bar girl suspected of spying for the North - and make it look like the routine murder of a prostitute.Right from the start, he suspects that there is far more to this mission than he is being told. Why, in a city where every other citizen may have ties to the North, is one young woman such a threat? Why not simply turn her over to the local authorities? And, perhaps most important, why assign this brutal task to him? He's a soldier, not an assassin.War may be hell, but, as Wingo struggles to uncover answers amidst the lies and corruption of wartime Saigon, he soon learns that even darker and more tortuous trials await him - and that the price of holding onto his soul may be more than any one man can endure.",

Behind the takeover is an odd, yet frighteningly effective, alliance of international governments and inner-city gangs.Lining up against the tyrannical forces are three men, each committed to exposing the fifty-year-old conspiracy, and together capable of mounting an undeniably formidable resistance. If they succeed, the world has a chance. If they fail, the world is doomed to the prospect of a \"Fourth Reich.\" The key to the world's future is The Thor Conspiracy.Previously published by Nelson Books, The Thor Conspiracy has sold 50,000 copies.",

This is a book of hope, a guide to aging without fear or anxiety. Using the same inspired structure of alternating voices, Chris and Harry have recast  material specifically for women, who already live longer and take better care of themselves than men. New material covers menopause and post-menopause, as well as cardiac disease, osteoporosis, sexuality, and more. This is the book that can show us how to turn back our biological clocks\u2014how to put off 70% of the normal problems of aging (weakness, sore joints, bad balance) and eliminate 50% of serious illness and injury. The key to the program is found in Harry's Rules: Exercise six days a week. Don't eat crap. Connect and commit to others. There are seven rules all together, based on the latest findings in cell physiology, evolutionary biology, anthropology, and experimental psychology. Dr. Lodge explains how and why they work\u2014and Chris Crowley, who is living proof of their effectiveness (skiing better today, for example, than he did twenty years ago), gives the just-as-essential motivation.Both men and women can become functionally younger every year for the next five to ten years, then continue to live with newfound vitality and pleasure deep into our 80s and beyond.",

And how are you supposed to be an artist in this world if you don't have a vision? Bob trades in his artist's palette for a minivan full of house paints, hammers, and nails, and sets about earning a little cash as a handyman.Although he turns out to be very bad at fixing the things he's hired to fix, Bob demonstrates quite a knack for fixing the lives of the people around him. In the midst of his jerry-built repairs and inspired home improvements, Bob meets an extraordinary cast of characters--rendered in all their delightful eccentricity and human frailty as only Carolyn See can-each of whom shows Bob the true scope of his own remarkable talent. There's Angela Landry, a housewife with far too much time on her hands, a sexpot of a stepdaughter, and a son in need of attention; Jamie Walker, whose allergy-prone and ADD-afflicted children keep a menagerie of scaly pets that far exceed Jamie's managerial skills; Valerie LeClerc, older, sadder, and certainly wiser than Bob; and Hank and Ben, who leave a narrow-minded Midwest only to find unremitting illness and isolation in the California of their dreams.Replete with stunning images and all of Carolyn See's trademark humor and wisdom,The Handyman depicts the countless ways in which our lives are intertwined and the profound effects we can have on one another. It is the kind of surprising and miraculously uplifting novel we have come to expect from the woman Diane Johnson has called \"one of our most important writers.\"From the Hardcover edition.",

But his praying was superficial, less than satisfying.Then Brown made some discoveries. He learned to go beyond formalities to \"the prayer of a child reaching out to a father. It was the cry of my soul for the intimacy with the God of my life.\"In Approaching God, Brown can help you experience the same kind of intimate relationship with God. Through warm, engaging stories and honest sharing of struggles he explores the essentials of prayer. For example, Brown found that God not only waits to hear us, he seeks us.Brown also discovered that prayer can be quite honest. We can come to God without fear and without a concern for \"sophistication and slickness.\" Brown explores the practical side of praying - the amount of time we give to it, the time of day, even the most helpful posture. And he helps us understand the \"deeper\" side of prayer - the awe and wonder of relating to a great God. Throughout Approaching God, Brown warmly invites us all to the richness of joyous, authentic prayer.",

        "Description": "Today&#39;s marketplace is seeing radical changes in the way companies do business with one another. New partnerships and alliances are constantly being forged, the lines between industries have blurred, and it has become difficult to tell one business from another, and who&#39;s competing with whom.   The Death of Competition helps managers make sense of this chaos. Using biological ecology as a metaphor, it reveals how today&#39;s business environment parallels the natural world, and how, just like organisms in nature, companies must coexist and coevolve within their own business ecosystems. Through numerous examples, he explains the radically new cooperative/competitive relationships like the one forged between IBM and Microsoft and provides a comprehensive framework businesses can use to enhance their own collaborations with their customers, suppliers, investors and communities.",

        "Description": "In nineteen minutes, you can mow the front lawn, color your hair, watch a third of a hockey game. In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five....In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge.Sterling is a small, ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens -- until the day its complacency is shattered by a shocking act of violence. In the aftermath, the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them, the lines between truth and fiction, right and wrong, insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier, the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case, could be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes. And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families.  Nineteen Minutes is New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult's most raw, honest, and important novel yet. Told with the straightforward style for which she has become known, it asks simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you? What does it mean to be different in our society? Is it ever okay for a victim to strike back? And who -- if anyone -- has the right to judge someone else?",
