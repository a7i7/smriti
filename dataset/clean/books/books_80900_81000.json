        "Title": "No Free Ride: From the Mean Streets to the Mainstream",
        "Authors": "By Mfume, Kweisi and Stodghill, Ron",
        "Description": "Courageous. Uplifting. Triumphant. The story of Kweisi Mfume is a classic American saga. Uprooted from the rural tranquillity of Turners Station and thrust upon the gritty streets of west Baltimore, the child born Frizzell Gray seemed fated to become another statistic of Black urban pathology. In a household shattered by domestic violence and emotional strife, Frizzell had only the strong arms of his loving mother to protect him and his three younger sisters. But when he was sixteen years old, his cancer-stricken mother died in his arms, and his world was shattered. To survive, he turned to the streets. He dropped out of school, worked odd jobs, and hustled for money. Torn apart by the rough code of street gangs and the Vietnam war that sent his best friends home in body bags, Frizzell had fathered five children out of wedlock by the time he was twenty-two.But fate stepped in. In a life-altering moment of revelation, Frizzell saw where he was headed and realized that everything about the old Frizzell Gray would have to die. As he embarked on the journey to transform himself, he affirmed his spiritual rebirth and took the name Kweisi Mfume, Ghanian for \"Conquering Son of Kings.\" Today, a quarter-century later, Kweisi Mfume is among the most respected and influential leaders in the United States. Mfume's journey into the nations power elite was as rocky as it was colorful: from night GED courses to college student activism to militant radio disc jockey, where his first philosophical battles were fought against James Brown, the \"Godfather of Soul.\" Mfume's emergence as a political figure broke every rule--he parlayed his burgeoning fame as a talk-radio provocateur to win a seat as a maverick member of the Baltimore City Council. He then took on the local political machine to represent a Congressional district that encompasses both the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich. Once he arrived in Washington, Mfume proved to be a bold political strategist, facing off against Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton on such issues as aid to the Nicaraguan contras, the Civil Rights Bill, Lani Guinier's embattled nomination for Attorney General, and sending U.S. armed forces into Haiti. As Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, he led the CBC through a period of unprecedented dynamism. And in international affairs, Mfume's relentless campaign to end apartheid has earned him the respect and friendship of Nelson Mandela.Far from a kiss-and-tell political memoir, No Free Ride illuminates the forces that helped shape a new wave of Black leaders left to carry the torch for Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. Mfume moves beyond the divisive rhetoric of white fear and Black anger generated by the assault on affirmative action, the O.J. verdict, and the Million Man March. He exposes the myth of arrogant, self-righteous values and affirms the real value of values. And while Mfume asserts that \" the government can't and won't solve every one of our problems,\" he doesn't hesitate to indict those who collude in the soul murder of America's poor and forgotten.In this candid and insightful memoir, Mfume reminds us that everything has a price, and that as citizens of a democracy, none of us can expect a free ride. His visionary blueprint for all Americans, white and Black, can guide us as we face the challenge of fashioning a society in which our two nations can at last become one.",

Everyone  falls from time to time; and the cause of the fall is not as important  as what we do while we are down and how we get back up. Be strong and  courageous.   Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the  Lord your God goes with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you  (Deuteronomy 31:6).    Learn some of these important life lessons:   Why  pride and selfishness will lead to destruction.  How to be content.   The temptation to be self-sufficient.    Like the woman in the  television commercial, we must put aside fear, pride, or embarrassment  and call out for help. We must learn not only how to ask for help, but  Whom to ask.     After all, help is just a breath away.",

So when his brother brings in Callie Robbins to protect him, Ben has a few issues. First, he doesn't need a bodyguard. Second, she's a 130-pound girl--more smoking hot than smoking gun. And third, what if his body wants her guarding the night shift?Callie has no problem brushing aside Ben's disbelief. She left the FBI to escape the boys' club, but she can be deeper undercover and twice as lethal as any beefy John Doe. As for whether someone's after Bennett or not, the death threats and car bombs look pretty convincing to Callie. Of course, she might get distracted, sitting inches from the sexiest judge in DC for ten hours a day. Keeping him safe is no picnic. Keeping it professional--that might be impossible.\"She's a delight!\"--Christina Dodd\"So smart, sexy and fast paced. I devour her stories.\"--Lori Foster",

When suburban Claudia Kincaid decides to run away, she knows she doesn't just want to run from somewhere, she wants to run to somewhere -- to a place that is comfortable, beautiful, and, preferably, elegant. She chooses the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Knowing that her younger brother Jamie has money and thus can help her with a serious cash-flow problem, she invites him along. Once settled into the museum, Claudia and Jamie find themselves caught up in the mystery of an angel statue that the museum purchased at auction for a bargain price of $225. The statue is possibly an early work of the Renaissance master, Michelangelo, and therefore worth millions. Is it? Or isn't it? Claudia is determined to find out. Her quest leads her to Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, the remarkable old woman who sold the statue, and to some equally remarkable discoveries about herself.",

It summarizes the results of a five-year study conducted in cooperation with the senior corporate planners at ABC, CBS, NBC, Time Warner, The New York Times, and the Washington Post.  The central question is whether the new electronic media and the use of personal computers in the communication process will lead to a fragmentation or \"demassification\" of the mass audience.    This study demonstrates, contrary to the opinion of some analysts,  that the movement toward fragmentation and specialization will be modest and that the national media and common political culture will remain robust.     W. Russell Neuman, directs the Communications Research Group of MIT's Media Laboratory. He has published widely and among his recent books are The Paradox of Mass Politics (1986) and the The Telecommunications Revolution (1991).

Suddenly Hope is both in love and deeply in doubt, and ultimately frightened of the man she loves. Is it possible that this adoring man is hiding something even worse? The spell cast by a brilliant sociopath has her trapped in his web, too confused and dazzled to escape, as he continues to tighten his grip on her.\u00a0Danielle Steel delivers an unforgettable tale of danger and obsessive love, as she explores the dark secrets that sometimes lurk just below the surface of ordinary lives, writing about men and women and their courage to prevail even in the face of evil.",

In a city of grandeur  and decadence, beauty and bloodshed, two boys, best friends, dream of glory in service  of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator. The  other is a bastard child. As young Gaius and Marcus grow to manhood, they are trained  in the art of combat\u2014under the tutelage of one of Rome\u2019s most fearsome gladiators.  For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier\u2019s proving ground.  For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield  where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary  slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win. But as Rome is  thrust into the grip of bitter conflict, as every Roman prepares to take sides in  the coming battle, Gaius and Marcus\u2019s friendship will be put to the ultimate test.\u2026",

        "Description": "In a magnificent land where myth mixes treacherously with truth, one woman is in   charge of telling them apart. Liu Hulan is the Inspector in China\u2019s Ministry of Public   Security whose tough style rousts wrongdoers and rubs her superiors the wrong way.   Now her latest case finds her trapped between her country\u2019s distant past and her   own recent history. The case starts at a rally for a controversial cult that ends   suddenly in bloodshed, and leads to the apparent murder of an American archaeologist,   which officials want to keep quiet. And haunting Hulan\u2019s investigation is the possible   theft of ancient dragon bones that might alter the history of civilization itself. Getting to the bottom of ever-spiraling events, Hulan unearths more scandals, confronts   more murderers, and revives tragic memories that shake her tormented marriage to   its core. In the end, she solves a mystery as big, unruly, and complex as China itself.Praise for Dragon Bones\u201cStays with you long after the conventional thriller is forgotten.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post Book World\u201cLisa  See is one of the classier practitioners of . . . the international  thriller. . . . She draws her characters . . . with convincing depth,  and offers up documentary social detail that reeks of freshly raked  muck. See\u2019s China is as vivid as Upton Sinclair\u2019s Chicago.\u201d\u2014The New York Times Book Review",
