Ken Blanchard and Marc Muchnick's The Leadership Pill provides the answer. Consider this tantalizing possibility: What if there were a pill that could actually stimulate the natural powers of the mind and body to provide leadership? In the story, an amazing new pill heightens one leader's powers, but contains the wrong ingredients, stimulating him in an obsessive and shortsighted direction with disastrous results. In contrast, the Effective Leader, working without a pill, proclaims that \"only through sustainability can our teams remain motivated and successful.\" An inspiring and supportive leader, he supplies the right ingredients, earning his team's respect and trust with a blend of integrity, partnership, and affirmation. The hard-won result is a highly motivated team producing consistent top performance and genuine success. Ultimately it is recognized that \"leadership for a lifetime\" is much easier to digest than a pill for leaders looking for a quick fix. Destined to be a transforming experience for countless readers, The Leadership Pill shows business managers at any level how to apply the right techniques for getting both results and the commitment of their people, even when the pressure to perform is high.",

        "Description": "\"Fifteen years ago, many questioned the wisdom of sequencing the human genome. There were concerns not only about the technical feasibility of such an effort, but also that its scientific worth would prove too modest to warrant the investment of human and financial capital that the project would require. This collection of essays stands as eloquent testimony to those who overcame such doubts to create, nurture, and finish the sequencing of the human genome in April 2003, a date that will forever stand out in human history. The wide and public availability of the human genome sequence and the other tools spawned by the Human Genome Project have helped to create an unparalleled era of biomedical discovery. It has opened up new avenues for the understanding of the biology of human health and disease. Many of these avenues remain to be fully explored, but this volume already demonstrates that information about genetics and genomics is increasingly permeating our clinical approach to patients.\"\u2014from the Foreword by Dr. Elias ZerhouniFor more than a century, knowledge about the role of genes has been gradually reshaping perceptions of our health and of ourselves. From Mendel's work with plants and Watson and Crick's model of DNA's double-helix structure to the recent decoding of the human genome, the tremendous advances in our ability to analyze and interpret gene sequences are revolutionizing many aspects of medicine. Genomic Medicine collects and updates an acclaimed series of articles published in the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine since November 2002 that together provide an authoritative and comprehensive overview of the latest developments in the field of medical genetics and an exploration of where these advances might take medicine over the next decade.Beginning with a fundamental primer and a useful glossary of terms, the book offers the latest information on the use of genetics to screen, diagnose, and treat a wide variety of diseases, including breast and ovarian cancer and cardiovascular, Alzheimer, and Parkinson disease. Also included are discussions of population screening, pharmacogenetics, and the ethical, legal, and social dimensions of genomic medicine. Edited by leaders in the field, written by experts from around the globe, and brimming with full-color illustrations, Genomic Medicine is an indispensable guide to the full potential of the DNA-based transformation of medicine.",

Yet Skip soon senses something big starting to unfold. Something rooted in corruption, resulting in violence--and motivated by that old demon . . . desire.Across town, Talba Wallis has a simple desire of her own--to find out what Russell Fortier's disappearance has to do with her. Wallis is a woman who leads three lives--poet, computer expert, and part-time detective once hired to spy on Fortier. But the private investigator she worked for can't help her out. He's lying in his office with a bullet in his chest.Reporter Jane Storey is also walking down that mean, sultry street--she's on the brink of the biggest story of her life. But she's got a bad feeling she's being played like a deck of cards.In fact, all three investigators--cop, private eye, and reporter--sense an unknown (and malevolent) presence pulling strings they cannot see.Smith's steamy masterpiece is a tale of desire running out of control . . . of corporate greed, a lust for power, and a legacy of misery that only now must be set right--at a cost measured in blood and heartbreak and lives.",

        "Title": "John Kenneth Galbraith: His Life, His Politics, His Economics",
        "Authors": "By Parker, Richard",
        "Description": "The life and times of America\u2019s most celebrated economist, assessing his lessons\u2014and warnings\u2014for us todayJohn Kenneth Galbraith\u2019s books\u2014among them The Affluent Society and American Capitalism\u2014are famous for good reason. Written by a scholar renowned for energetic political engagement and irrepressible wit, they are models of provocative good sense that warn prophetically of the dangers of deregulated markets, war in Asia, corporate greed, and stock-market bubbles. Galbraith\u2019s work has also deeply\u2014and controversially\u2014influenced his own profession, and in Richard Parker\u2019s hands his biography becomes a vital reinterpretation of American economics and public policy.Born and raised on a small Canadian farm, Galbraith began teaching at Harvard during the Depression. He was FDR\u2019s \u201cprice czar\u201d during the war and then a senior editor of Fortune before returning to Harvard and to fame as a bestselling writer. Parker shows how, from his early championing of Keynes to his acerbic analysis of America\u2019s \u201cprivate wealth and public squalor,\u201d Galbraith regularly challenged prevailing theories and policies. And his account of Galbraith\u2019s remarkable friendship with John F. Kennedy, whom he served as a close advisor while ambassador to India, is especially relevant for its analysis of the intense, dynamic debates that economists and politicians can have over how America should manage its wealth and power. This masterful chronicle gives color, depth, and meaning to the record of an extraordinary life.                                                                               Richard Parker is an Oxford-trained economist and senior fellow of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. A cofounder of the magazine Mother Jones, he writes extensively on economics and public policy. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife and children.                                                     A New York Times Notable Book\u00a0John Kenneth Galbraith is America's most famous economist for good reason. A witty commentator on America's political follies and a versatile author of bestselling books that warn prophetically of the dangers of deregulated markets, corporate greed, and inattention to the costs of our military power (among them The Great Crash: 1929, The Affluent Society, and The New Industrial State), Galbraith always makes economics relevant to the crises of the day. This first authorized biography is, in Richard Parker's hands, an important reinterpretation both of public policy and of how economics is practiced. Born in 1908 and raised on a small Canadian farm, Galbraith began to teach at Harvard in his twenties. In 1938 he left to work in New Deal Washington, eventually rising to become FDR's \"price czar\" during the war. Following his years as a writer at Fortune, where he did much to introduce the work of John Maynard Keynes to a wide audience, he returned to Harvard in 1949 and began writing the books that would make him famous. Over the years, Galbraith developed a distinctive way of \"doing economics,\" and it made him a critic both of conservatives and of many liberal economists. Parker's vibrant, nuanced portrait is enlightening on Galbraith's engagement with his fellow economists and the politics they influenced?from the \"Neoclassical Synthesis\" and the New Frontier to monetarism, supply-siders, and the conservative revolution of the 1980s and 1990s. It is also a dramatic narrative about public policies and the people who create them, for Galbraith was often at the very epicenter of politics in his time. From his acerbic analysis of the nation's \"private wealth and public squalor\" in the 1950s to his denunciations of the Vietnam War, Galbraith regularly challenged the \"conventional wisdom\" (a phrase he coined). Parker's account of Galbraith's friendship with John F. Kennedy, whom he served as ambassador to India, is filled with new insights and information about economic policy, about American policy in Asia, and about the heavy influence of the Pentagon's budget on every aspect of public affairs. Subsequent chapters, analyzing Galbraith's responses to the mistakes made by later administrations in managing America's wealth and power, offer a powerful critique of the Johnson, Nixon, Reagan, and Clinton years. But Parker gives equal attention to the warm, lively, and nourishing friendships that shaped the private life of Kenneth and Kitty Galbraith and their high-spirited family. This masterful chronicle gives color, depth, and meaning to the record of an extraordinary life.                  \"There was a time when John Kenneth Galbraith was the most famous economist in America, a man whose books regularly became best sellers. But today he is little honored in the economics profession, where, as Richard Parker remarks in his engaging and exhaustive biography, Mr. Galbraith is regarded as something of an outsider, a fine writer who never became comfortable with the detailed mathematical formulas that came to dominate economics.\"?Floyd Norris, The New York Times                               \"There was a time when John Kenneth Galbraith was the most famous economist in America, a man whose books regularly became best sellers.

It is also, thanks to Galbraith's longevity, his work in so many administrations, and his battles with so many other economic thinkers, a fine one-volume history of economic thought in the 20th century . . . I will confess that I was initially skeptical about the book's 820 pages of dense type, but every detail is justified and every digression fascinating . . . [A] comprehensive account of the 20th century's economic battles.\"?Thomas Frank, The New York Times Book Review\u00a0\"[Parker is] an engaging writer [who] does a good job covering all [the] episodes in [Galbraith's] busy life. At every point he is at pains to set the stage, making sure that the reader understands the characters and motives involved and the issues at stake.\"?Dan Seligman, The Wall Street Journal\u00a0\"With a strong grasp of complex economic issues that span some sixty years, Parker succeeds in placing Galbraith's economic contributions within the intellectual tradition?part Keynesian and part derived from the work of Thorstein Veblen?to which they belong . . . In tracing Galbraith's intellectual development, Parker has also written a much-needed history of American progressivism.\"?Jeffrey Madrick, The New York Review of Books\u00a0\"Doing justice to this life story requires an outsize biography, one that not only tells Mr. Galbraith's tale but sets it on the broader canvas of America's political and economic evolution. And Richard Parker's book does just that . . . He is a good writer, who is particularly deft at bringing to life and explaining economic ideas and policy debates.\"?The Economist\u00a0\"The story of this man's life and work, wonderfully rendered in this magnum opus, offers an antidote to the public ennui, economic cruelty, and government malfeasance that poison life in America today . . . Parker lifts up a single life as an image of how intelligence, compassion, and commitment remain the essence of social hope.\"?James Carroll, The Boston Globe\u00a0\"John Kenneth Galbraith towered?literally and figuratively?over twentieth-century America, afflicting the comfortable with searing wit and unassailable logic, and comforting the afflicted with compelling ideas for improving society to the benefit of all. To understand the ideals that propelled America from FDR's New Deal until Bush's Raw Deal, one must comprehend Galbraith's life, politics, and economics. Herewith, a stunningly lucid guide. Richard Parker gives to Galbraith the deep insight and sweeping perspective that Galbraith gives to America.\"?Robert B. Reich, Brandeis University\u00a0\"Parker's timely biography of Ken Galbraith and his brilliant career is an extraordinary gift to a nation grappling more than ever with the profound issues that Galbraith addressed so eloquently over so many years with his famed intellect and wit. Galbraith's passion for social justice, his skepticism about excessive power in the hands of either government or the private sector, and his indispensable contributions to progressive politics and economic thought shine through every page of this book, and they are still highly relevant to our twenty-first-century national debate on the great domestic and global challenges of our time. For all who care about a better world and a fairer reconciliation at home and abroad between what Galbraith called 'private affluence and public squalor,' this remarkable volume should be required reading. It is both an education and an inspiration.\"?Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u00a0\"This is a superb book, literate and fascinating, about one of the truly original minds of the century.

This saga of his life and thought presents a lively review of what has happened to our economy and to the profession of economics in the last seventy years.\"?Barbara Bergmann, author of The Economic Emergence of Women\u00a0\"John Kenneth Galbraith is the Harvard economist who became one of the most influential oracles of the contemporary world. An often searing critic of big business, he has been responsible for reshaping the anatomy of modern thought, extending his lively sanctions into the many branches of his eclectic intellect. In this thoughtful and highly readable volume, the Oxford-trained economist Richard Parker provides an essential guide to the man and his ideas. It captures an extraordinary life, extraordinarily well.\"?Peter C.

The book not only details the richly varied experiences of one of the great public intellectuals and social commentators of our time; it also offers a most interesting account of the evolution of economic thought from the era of John Maynard Keynes to the present day.\"?Derek Bok\u00a0\"An engaging and comprehensive review of the life and times of a brilliant, prolific twentieth-century thinker. Galbraith understands that the structural determinants, limitations, and consequences of markets have been largely ignored by economists?to the detriment of the discipline and of society. This is a poignant book with important messages for the twenty-first century.\"?David K. Foot, University of Toronto and co-author of Boom, Bust & Echo\u00a0\"[An] accessible, well-written approach to both Galbraith's life and the larger issues to which he has so effectively devoted his thought: an exemplary intellectual biography.\"?Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\u00a0\"[Galbraith] took on academic and political orthodoxies to transform the way informed people think about the economy, institutions, and social justice . . . Parker's biography is a model of clarity on these matters.\"?Publishers Weekly",

        "Authors": "By Lardy, Nicholas R.",
        "Description": "China's Unfinished Economic Revolution offers a fundamentally different interpretation of China's economic reform. The common view that China's gradualistic approach has served it well overlooks the fact that state-owned banks for the last two decades have channeled a large share of sharply rising household savings into what are mostly unreformed, money-losing companies. The result is that several of China's largest financial institutions now are insolvent. To avoid a major domestic banking crisis the book argues that China must recapitalize and restructure its domestic banking system and end the long-standing practice of making lending decisions based on political rather than economic criteria.Nicholas Lardy explains that this course will inevitably be costly in political terms, in part because it will lead for a time to a slower rate of economic growth. But the alternative is even less attractive&#151;permanently slower growth, continued macroeconomic instability, an inability to meet the expectations of the international community for the opening of its domestic financial markets, and insufficient resources to deal with severe environmental deterioration, growing water shortages, and a rapidly aging population.This timely book also analyzes the new reform initiatives China has launched in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, suggests additional steps that must be taken, and evaluates the implications for U.S. policy.",

Although learning experiences designed to actively teach self-management techniques are usually directed toward children with severe academic and behavior problems, these skills are also extremely beneficial for the general student population. An excellent resource for school-based practitioners who wish to address the needs of all school-aged children and adolescents, this book presents practical approaches for designing and implementing self-management interventions in school settings.",

After retiring from the force in 1985, Dietl went into business for himself as a security consultant and built an international company worth millions. Here, in his own inimitable style, Bo Dietl shows how, through smart networking, anyone can make it just as big as he did.  Using examples from his own vast experience in dealing with business friends and foes in a variety of situations-including his \"lunchatation situations,\" where personal connections and opportunity can come together in any setting-Dietl tells how knowing what to say, how to say it, when to say it, and who to say it to can count more than anything when it comes to success in the winner-take-all arena of big business.",

His father is an alcoholic who left his family. His sister is an overachieving Ivy League graduate. And Martin?  Martin is stuck in between--floundering.But during the summer after 7th grade, Martin meets a boy who will change his life forever. Jimmy Harker appears one night with a deceptively simple question:  Will you help?  Where did this boy come from, with his strange accent and urgent request? Is he a dream? It's the most vivid dream Martin's ever had. And he meets Jimmy again and again--but how can his dreams be set in London during the Blitz? How can he see his own grandather, standing outside the Embassy? How can he wake up with a head full of people and facts and events that he certainly didn't know when he went to sleep--but which turn out to be verifiably real?The people and the scenes Martin witnesses have a profound effect on him. They become almost more real to him than his waking companions. And he begins to believe that maybe he can help Jimmy. Or maybe that he must help Jimmy, precisely because all logic and reason argue against it.This is a truly remarkable and deeply affecting novel about fathers and sons, heroes and scapegoats. About finding a way to live with faith and honor and integrity. And about having an answer to the question: What did you do to help?",

That same day, Tucker resigned, and Huckabee would serve as governor of Arkansas until 2007, winning many national honors along the way.Character Makes a Difference is Mike Huckabee\u2019s biographical account of how he handled that potentially major constitutional crisis and why he believes character is the key issue in everyone\u2019s life, \u201cin the work you do, the candidates you vote for, the people who look to you for leadership.\u201d",

Before long, Bruno is thrashing and writhing out on the dance floor. Just one problem: he's not standing up, And soon, he's not even breathing.The newly late Mr. Huntley was poisoned, that's certain. But the number of suspects with a yen to send Bruno to the devil could fill an audition for extras in the next Quentin Tarantino flick. When Wesley is arrested for the murder because of a long-standing dispute with the maniacal mogul, Madeline knows he couldn't be guilty. But to prove it, she has to wade through the muck of a mudslinging family, outrun a pair of crazed canines, dodge a pair of well-aimed bullets, and expose a slew of secrets that could put a soap opera to shame. Somebody's cooked up a murder, and it's up to Madeline to find out who--before she faces a fadeout of her own.",
