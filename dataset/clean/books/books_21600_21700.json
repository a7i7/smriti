        "Description": "For years, the world saw the Internet as a creature of theU.S. Department of Defense. Now some claim that the Internet is aself-governing organism controlled by no one and needing nooversight. Although the National Science Foundation and othergovernment agencies continue to support and oversee criticaladministrative and coordinating functions, the Internet is remarkablydecentralized and uninstitutionalized. As it grows in scope,bandwidth, and functionality, the Internet will require greatercoordination, but it is not yet clear what kind of coordinatingmechanisms will evolve. The essays in this volume clarify these issues and suggest possiblemodels for governing the Internet. The topics addressed range fromsettlements and statistics collection to the sprawling problem ofdomain names, which affects the commercial interests of millions ofcompanies around the world. One recurrent theme is the inseparabilityof technical and policy issues in any discussion involving theInternet.ContributorsGuy Almes, Ashley Andeen, Joseph P. Bailey, Steven M.

From its cheerful, red cranberry bogs in the fall and the quiet desolation of winter to its profusion of daffodils in the spring and warm, sunny beaches in summer, Nantucket lends itself perfectly to the camera's lens. In this evocative volume, longtime resident and renowned photographer Cary Hazlegrove has captured the essence of Nantucket with a selection of her most memorable images of the island -- a breathtaking aerial view of a beach, a charming detail of cobblestones, the striking composition of a lighthouse, a heartbreaking sweep of the moors. Accompanied by poignant, often humorous quotes from Nantucket locals and a thoughtful introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and part-time resident David Halberstam, this book provides a constant source of dreams and inspirations.",

        "Title": "An Infinity of Little Hours: Five Young Men and Their Trial of Faith in the Western World's Most Austere Monastic Order",
        "Authors": "By Maguire, Nancy Klein",
        "Description": "In 1960, five young men arrived at the imposing gates of   Parkminster, the largest center of the most rigorous and   ascetic monastic order in the Western world: the   Carthusians. This is the story of their five-year journey   into a society virtually unchanged in its behavior and   lifestyle since its foundation in 1084.   An Infinity of Little Hours is a uniquely intimate portrait   of the customs and practices of a monastic order   almost entirely unknown until now. It is also a drama of   the men's struggle as they avoid the 1960s?the decade of   hedonism, music, fashion, and amorality?and enter an   entirely different era and a spiritual world of their own   making. After five years each must face a choice: to make   \"solemn profession\" and never leave Parkminster; or to   turn his back on his life's ambition to find God in solitude.   A remarkable investigative work, the book combines   first-hand testimony with unique source material to   describe the Carthusian life. And in the final chapter,   which recounts a reunion forty years after the events   described elsewhere in the book, Nancy Klein Maguire   reveals which of the five succeeded in their quest, and   which did not.",

        "Authors": "By Conrad, Peter",
        "Description": "A fresh, provocative look at one of the most enigmatic figures in the history of film by \"one of our most acute cultural critics\" (Paul Fussell)Orson Welles was a metamorphic man, a magical shape-changer who made up myths about himself and permitted others to add to their store. On different occasions, he likened himself to Christ--mankind's redeemer--and to Lucifer--the rebel angel who brought about the fall.  His persona compounded the roles he played--kings, despots, generals, captains of industry, autocratic film directors--and the more or less fictitious exploits with which he regaled other people or which they attributed to him. Hailed in childhood as a genius, he remained mystified by his own promise, unable to understand or control an intellect that he came to think of as a curse; and he ended his days shilling wine and performing magic tricks on talk shows. At times, he saw the collapse of his early ambitions as a tragedy; in other moods, he viewed his life as a humbling comedy, and settled down--like another favorite character, Shakespeare's Falstaff --to eat, drink and be irresponsibly merry.Rather than producing another conventional biography of Welles, Peter Conrad has set out to investigate the stories Welles told about his life--the myths and secret histories hidden in films both made and unmade, in the books Welles wrote and those he read. The result takes us deep into Welles' imagination, showing how he created, then ultimately destroyed himself.",

        "Title": "Sword of San Jacinto: A Life of Sam Houston",
        "Authors": "By De Bruhl, Marshall",
        "Description": "Sam Houston was one of the most remarkable figures in American history. He was a native of Virginia who as a soldier, statesman, and adventurer made his mark on the frontier in Tennessee and the Arkansas Territory and then went on to dominate the early history of Texas.Now, drawing on newly accessible archival material, in particular the more than five thousand letters and documents in the Andrew Jackson Houston Collection of the Texas State Archives, historian Marshall De Bruhl vividly re-creates the career of this larger-than-life hero. In a narrative brimming with fascinating details, De Bruhl captures Houston in all his complexity.A frontiersman who lived among the Cherokee Indians for many years - he was the adopted son of Chief Ooleteka and a full citizen of the Cherokee Nation - Houston became a passionate defender of Indian rights.As a soldier, Sam Houston served under Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812 - and ensured Texas independence in 1836 with his astonishing victory over Santa Anna and the Mexican army at San Jacinto.As a politician, Houston was a Tennessee congressman at age thirty and then governor at age thirty-six. He then went on to be the first elected president of the Republic of Texas and one of the first senators from the new state. Because of his ardent defense of the Union and his refusal to swear allegiance to the Confederacy, he was deposed as governor of Texas in 1861.Houston's personal life was as tumultuous as his political and military careers. He married three times, always to much younger women. The first marriage, to an eighteen-year-old, ended mysteriously when she left him only eleven weeks later, whereupon he resigned the governorship of Tennessee and fled to the west and exile among his old Cherokee friends. It was there he married Tiana, the beautiful niece of Chief Ooleteka. Years later, at age forty-six, he married a woman of twenty, who bore eight children during their devoted and happy marriageAlthough Houston died ignored and vilified by those whose independence he had ensured, the eclipse of his reputation was brief. His fellow Texans soon acknowledged his central place in their history, and he is revered today as the father of Texas and its greatest hero.Sword of San Jacinto is a magnificent bicentennial-birthday tribute to a great Texan and a great American.",

        "Description": "Infamous Scribblers is a perceptive and witty exploration of   the most volatile period in the history of the American   press. News correspondent and renonwned media historian   Eric Burns tells of Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton   and Sam Adams?the leading journalists among the   Founding Fathers; of George Washington and John Adams,   the leading disdainers of journalists; and Thomas   Jefferson, the leading manipulator of journalists. These   men and the writers who abused and praised them in print   (there was, at the time, no job description of \"journalist\")   included the incendiary James Franklin, Ben's brother and   one of the first muckrakers; the high minded Thomas   Paine; the hatchet man James Callender, and a rebellious   crowd of propagandists, pamphleteers, and publishers. It   was Washington who gave this book its title. He once wrote   of his dismay at being \"buffited in the public prints by a set   of infamous scribblers.\"   The journalism of the era was often partisan, fabricated,   overheated, scandalous, sensationalistic and sometimes   stirring, brilliant, and indispensable. Despite its   flaws?even because of some of them?the participants   hashed out publicly the issues that would lead America to   declare its independence and, after the war, to determine   what sort of nation it would be.",

        "Description": "With translation rights sold in twenty-five countries, Gordon Dahlquist\u2019s spectacular and extraordinary debut novel was one of the most-talked-about acquisitions of 2005. Now this monumental Victorian thriller is destined to be the publishing sensation of 2006.It began with a simple note: a letter of rejection from Miss Temple\u2019s fianc\u00e9, written on crisp Ministry paper and delivered on her maid\u2019s silver tray. But for Miss Temple, Roger Bascombe\u2019s cruel rejection will ignite a harrowing quest for answers, plunging her into a mystery as dizzying as a hall of mirrors\u2014and a remote estate where danger abounds and all inhibitions are stripped bare.\u2026Thus begins Gordon Dahlquist\u2019s debut novel of Victorian suspense\u2014at once a dazzling feast for the senses and a beguiling, erotic literary adventure.Nothing could have prepared Miss Temple for where her pursuit of Roger Bascombe would take her\u2014or for the shocking things she would find behind the closed doors of forbidding Harschmort Manor: men and women in provocative disguise, acts of licentiousness and violence, heroism and awakening. But she will also find two allies: Cardinal Chang, a brutal assassin with the heart of a poet, and a royal doctor named Svenson, at once fumbling and heroic\u2014both of whom, like her, lost someone at Harschmort Manor. As the unlikely trio search for answers\u2014hurtling them from elegant brothels to gaslit alleyways to shocking moments of self-discovery-- they are confronted by puzzles within puzzles. And the closer they get to the truth, the more their lives are in danger. For the conspiracy they face\u2014an astonishing alchemy of science, perverted religion, and lust for power\u2014is so terrifying as to be beyond belief.In a novel that shatters conventions and seethes with danger and eroticism, Gordon Dahlquist has made a spectacular literary debut. And in Miss Temple he has created an unforgettable guide through a disturbing, seductive, and all-too-real world. By turns brutal and tender, shocking and deliciously romantic, The Glass Books of The Dream Eaters is a novel for the ages, a bold and brilliant work of the imagination",

It is an intimate and revealing portrait of the animal kingdom engaged in life's most essential activity.Internationally-acclaimed illustrator Dugald Stermer presents this extraordinary visual essay on the rituals of courtship and seduction and, of course, the sex act itself. The book focuses on three stages of mating: Foreplay - the rituals of display, dispute and seduction; Mating - from engagement to exchange; and Procreation - waiting, watching, and protecting.Stermer's beautifully expressive watercolors and accompanying text offer a remarkable perspective on this world of dance, harems, group sex and cannibalism. It is a world where abstinence or chastity is never an option, except between humans.",

When Cordelia goes to investigate the mansion of her vision, she finds herself surrounded by baby products, portraits...and chased by a many-tentacled monster. When Angel arrives on the scene, he's shocked to discover that he recognizes some of the subjects of the portraits. Distant memories of a night spent with storytellers Mary and Percy Shelley recall an artist Darla, his longtime paramour and partner in crime, once favored. But can that artist still be alive today? An ancient evil is using a painting to keep its body alive and intact, and in the meantime is preying on a child. In the process of saving the child, Cordelia, Angel, Gunn, and Wesley are going to learn -- the hard way -- that looks aren't everything.",

Today, we understand that the changes set in motion five years ago have broadened as the struggle against terrorism continues.In this sequel, experts and activists including Alan Brinkley and Joseph Lelyveld, legal scholars Kathleen Sullivan and Stephen Schulhofer, and former government officials John Podesta and Bill Bradley report on the diverse actions, taken in the name of security, that will serve to undermine American liberties, and explain why the consequences of these actions are ultimately counterproductive in preventing future terrorism.Today, we clearly see a disturbing pattern of undermining the judiciary, intimidating the press, and invading personal privacy. At the same time, government  actions have fueled hostility to America in the world at large and in Islamic communities in particular. The terrorists threaten our liberty, but they are not the only ones.",

Some were downright dangerous. Nobody seemed to be able to stick with low-fat regiments for any length of time. And a diet is useless if you can't stick with it.So Dr. Agatston developed his own. The South Beach Diet isn't complicated and doesn't require that you go hungry. You'll enjoy normal size helpings of meat, poultry, and fish. You'll also eat eggs, cheese, nuts, and vegetables. Snacks are required. You'll learn to avoid the bad carbs, like white flour, white sugar, and baked potatoes. Best of all, as you lose weight, you'll lose that stubborn belly fat first!Dr. Agatston's diet has produced consistently dramatic results (8 to 13 pounds lost in the first 2 weeks!) and has become a media sensation in South Florida. Now you, too, can join the ranks of the fit and fabulous with The South Beach Diet.",

        "Title": "The Few: The American \"\"Knights of the Air\"\" Who Risked Everything to Fight in the Battle of Britain",
        "Authors": "By Kershaw, Alex",
        "Description": "By the summer of 1940 World War II had been under way for nearly a year. Hitler was triumphant and planning an invasion of England. But the United States was still a neutral country and, as Winston Churchill later observed, \"the British people held the fort alone.\" A few Americans, however, did not remain neutral. They joined Britain's Royal Air Force to fight Hitler's air aces and help save Britain in its darkest hour. The Few is the never-before-told story of these thrill-seeking Americans who defied their country's neutrality laws to fly side-by-side with England's finest pilots. They flew the lethal and elegant Spitfire, and became \"knights of the air.\" With minimal training and plenty of guts they dueled the skilled pilots of Germany's Luftwaffe in the blue skies over England. They shot down several of Germany's fearsome aces, and were feted as national heroes in Britain. By October 1940, they had helped England win the greatest air battle in the history of aviation. At war's end, just one of the \"Few\" would be alive. The others died flying, wearing the RAF's dark blue uniform-each with a shoulder patch depicting an American eagle. As Winston Churchill said, \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\"",

        "Title": "A Serious Way of Wondering: The Ethics of Jesus Imagined",
        "Authors": "By Price, Reynolds",
        "Description": "When renowned novelist and poet Reynolds Price, one of Christianity's most eloquent outlaws, was invited to deliver the annual Peabody Lecture at Harvard University Memorial Church in 2001, he chose to explore a subject that has produced fierce debate -- even wars and crusades -- and is still intensely relevant today: the ethics of Jesus. In two succeeding lectures at the National Cathedral and at Auburn Seminary, he continued the theme, exploring not only the apparently contradictory ethics that Jesus articulates in the Gospels but also constructing scenes that present Jesus with urgent dilemmas he never confronts there. In A Serious Way of Wondering, Price greatly expands those lectures and imagines Jesus in moments of confrontation with three problems of burning moral concern -- suicide, homosexuality, and the plight of women in male-dominated cultures and faiths.It was while teaching a university course on the Gospels of Mark and John that Price first explored the ancient idea of expanding upon the Gospel narratives with further encounters between Jesus and troubled persons. Price has previously documented his studies in Three Gospels, a book in which he not only translated Mark and John from the Greek -- and discussed them extensively -- but also provided a third gospel of his own making. Price based the third gospel closely on the earliest sources but imagined his way into some of their baffling omissions. He continued those explorations when he wrote provocative new scenes for the cover story on Jesus in one of Time magazine's millennium issues.Now, in this new book, Price offers a devoted and profoundly thought-provoking look at a subject that underlies vast areas of world civilization and has occupied the minds of many great thinkers. A sweeping view of the inescapable implications of Jesus' merciful life and all-embracing thought, and of the benefits of enlarging our notions of humane community, A Serious Way of Wondering is a significant contribution to Price's penetrating works of religious inquiry.",

Now, in Emma's Gift, the Wortham family is struck down by the deaths of two close friends, including their neighbor Wilametta Hammond, just days before Christmas 1931. Wila is the mother of ten children and the glue that holds the family together. In his grief, her husband, George, ignores the children and has no will to live. Sam and Julia step in to help, but how can they manage ten extra children when they barely have enough for themselves? Can George overcome his grief and become the father his children need? And if Emma's nephew takes ownership of her land, will the Worthams be allowed to stay?  Masterfully told from the perspective of both Samuel and Julia, Emma's Gift is an unforgettable story of God's faithfulness and peace and of the seasons of life that shape each of us.",

        "Description": "Through a series of letters from a father to his college-age daughter, Dr. Walter Orenstein traces the role and the history of women in the Torah and shows, through text and commentary, that in traditional Jewish society the status of women is equal to that of men, though their function is often quite different. Letters to My Daughter: A Father Writes about Torah and the Jewish Woman introduces the reader to the Oral Law, to the exciting realm of Halakhah, and to some of the essential principles of Jewish philosophy.Although this work is addressed to a college student, it is meant for all women and men regardless of their backgrounds. Those who have a limited background in Jewish studies and seek an understanding of the principles of Jewish belief and the way that these principles impact upon her or his life will find this book a useful beginning to the world of Jewish scholarship.Those students whose Jewish education has taken them far beyond the rudiments of Torah knowledge but who are concerned with the status of women in Orthodox Judaism and lack the training to probe the sources on their own will find this book enlightening.This book also addresses itself to the Jewish man or woman who was raised in the secular world but who now searches for truth, meaning, and purpose in the Torah, hoping that its words will provide spiritual guidance, personal insight, and divine wisdom.",

        "Title": "Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women",
        "Authors": "By Walker, Alice",
        "Description": "In her best-selling 1992 novel, Possessing the Secret of Joy, Alice Walker opened a painful door: she brought the issue of female genital mutilation, a practice that affects one hundred million of the world's women, to the attention of the reading public. For many readers, this first encounter with a subject previously unfamiliar to them was shocking and unforgettable.Alice Walker decided early in the process of writing her novel that she had not yet done enough to help stop this age-old practice. She resolved to make a documentary film that would further educate people about the harmful, sometimes deadly process of removing the clitoris - and often the remaining outer genitalia - as a means of maintaining tradition and ensuring a woman's \"cleanliness\" and fidelity. To make the film, Alice Walker teamed up with Indian-British filmmaker Pratibha Parmar, whose credits include several widely acclaimed documentaries focusing on issues of race, gender, and sexuality. This book chronicles their odyssey together.Warrior Marks describes a unique filmmaking journey, from Alice Walker's first letter to Pratibha Parmar proposing the idea of the film to the many journal entries and observations each of them made along the way. From California to England to Senegal, The Gambia, and Burkina Faso, Warrior Marks follows Walker and Parmar as they interview people who are concerned with and affected by the practice of female genital mutilation. The text includes transcripts of their interviews, three new poems by Alice Walker, and over fifty photographs offering a vivid and poignant portrayal of the people and places they visited.For its insights into the collaborative creative process, as well as its perceptions about the politics of filmmaking and the politics of feminism, Warrior Marks is an extraordinary volume. It is also the adventure of two remarkable women who together fulfilled a dream.",

Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a sublime and seductive reading experience.\u00a0\u00a0Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.",

        "Authors": "By Michon, Cathryn",
        "Description": "Do you have what it takes to be a Grrl Genius? Of course you do! You are a smart, funny, beautiful Grrl Genius -- just because you say you are. In The Grrl Genius Guide to Life, stand-up comic and Grrl Genius Club founder Cathryn Michon explains why she is a genius and demonstrates how you can become one, too, by following her easy twelve-step program.The first step in the program is the most important: Admit that you are a Grrl Genius. Acknowledge that you are beautiful, intelligent, and talented and that you are the only person in the world who can decide just how great you are. In subsequent steps, you will learn to embrace the domestic arts, love your Grrl Genius good looks, celebrate your sexuality, appreciate your Grrl Genius mother, and pass the Grrl Genius message on to others!Filled with little-known facts about such unacknowledged Grrl Geniuses as Mozart's younger sister Nannerl and Einstein's wife Mileva, as well as hilarious, embarrassing stories from Michon's own life, The Grrl Genius Guide to Life is a must-read for Grrl Geniuses and Enlightened Males everywhere. Michon shares her most humiliating memories -- singing show tunes at her aunt's funeral, crying uncontrollably in an airplane bathroom and holding up the flight -- as well as her moments of triumph, like attending the birth of her niece (a future Grrl Genius) and getting liposuction that not a single human being noticed. This is an uproarious roller-coaster ride through the life of a self-declared Genius -- in which Michon writes about everything from doughnuts to divorce, from physics to push-up bras -- and a comic inspirational guide for those aspiring to Grrl Geniushood.Cathryn Michon is a genius -- just because she says she is. Read her book, and you will become one, too. As with any twelve-step program, becoming a Grrl Genius takes work. All your life you have been telling yourself that your butt is too big, your ideas are too small, and your love for creme-filled doughnuts is inherently evil. With the help of The Grrl Genius Guide to Life, you will learn to recognize your own brilliance, shamelessly proclaim it to the rest of the world, and eat all the Krispy Kreme doughnuts you want. In case you need inspiration, Michon has included numerous Grrl Genius slogans and Little Pink Post-it Notes; in case you get hungry, she has included her recipe for the best chocolate chip cookies in the world. So go on -- take the first step. Read the book that is guaranteed to change your life forever (or at the very least to make you laugh yourself silly) -- and declare your Genius to yourself and the world!",

        "Description": "The untold life story of a novelist whose greatest fictional creation was his own identity.In a 1998 article in New York magazine, Dean King offered readers a small sampling of the secret history of Patrick O'Brian, the creator of the bestselling series of Aubrey-Maturin novels. O'Brian has always guarded the secrets of his personal history with a zealousness that has bordered on the obsessive. And for years his fanatical readers have speculated on the true story and spun myths about his past based on the lives of his characters.Dean King at last unveils the story of Richard Patrick Russ, a writer and intellectual who emerged from the Second World War as Patrick O'Brian, a persona created in his own imagination and later refined by decades of rumor and speculation. What motivated this radical change of identity? Was it connected to O'Brian's service during the war, or the messy divorce from his first wife? Or was it the inexplicable act of an eccentric genius?King has crisscrossed Europe to speak to long-lost relatives, friends, and colleagues of his famously reclusive subject and has fashioned this wealth of information into a dramatic narrative that will appeal to an audience far wider than O'Brian's already dedicated fans.",
