Sherman succeeded in large measure because he could plumb and enact his own rage with ruthless clarity. The inner nature of Sherman's genius for destruction forms the center of Citizen Sherman.But this biography is much broader than an analysis of war from Sherman's perspective, for Michael Fellman seeks to illuminate the emotional as well as the intellectual, ideological, and occupational lives of this extraordinary, but at the same time representative, American Victorian man.It was men like Sherman, statesmen of the sword, who beat the Confederacy and destroyed the Indian nations, and Michael Fellman examines, with both detachment and compassion, how such men equipped themselves to secure American nationalism.",

        "Authors": "By Cross, Elsie Y. (EDT), Katz, Judith H., Miller, Frederick A., and Seashore, Edith Whitfield",
        "Description": "All the talk, all the new laws, all the seminars on learning to live with each other's differences - and still the workplace remains a hostile environment for too many people. Many organizations are still in the grip of racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression, even after the Civil Rights Act, the Women's Movement, countless workshops, support groups, and organizational initiatives. Is it possible to truly eliminate discrimination? Why do some companies persist in their efforts to challenge the status quo? The answer: the promise that diversity can create powerful options for a highly productive, synergistic workplace. Forward-thinking executives and managers know that their workforces will only grow more diverse. The sooner the organization fosters an environment where individuals and teams learn to work well together, the faster it achieves a competitive edge in an increasingly challenging marketplace.The Promise of Diversity is a contemporary, future-focused business anthology that represents the views of over 40 leaders, researchers, and practitioners who are actively working to address issues of oppression and diversity in organizations. Their enlightening essays cover such topics as throwing away the \"melting pot\" idea and regarding diversity as a strength, optimizing the value of individual difference through an organizational systems approach, developing cross-gender partnerships, the white male's current position at the intersection of race and gender, sexual orientation as a workforce diversity issue, and the problems faced by white women and women of color.Here are the hopes, fears, and dreams of leading change agents regarding the promise (and perils) of true diversity in the workplace. Representing each author's voice, style, and point of view, this collection of insightful articles is itself a living example of diversity and is destined to become a classic reference in its field.",

        "Description": "Wildlife and nature films are a hugely popular entertainment genre: networks such as Animal Planet and Discovery are stars in the cable television universe, viewers flock to IMAX theaters to see jaw-dropping footage from the wild, and the venerable BBC still scores triumphs with series such as Planet Earth. As cinematic technology brings ever more breathtaking images to the screen, and as our direct contact with nature diminishes, an ever-expanding audience craves the indirect experience of wild nature that these films provide.But this success has a dark side, as Chris Palmer reveals in his authoritative and engrossing report on the wildlife film business. A veteran producer and film educator, Palmer looks past the headlines about TV host Steve Irwin\u2019s death by stingray and filmmaker Timothy Treadwell falling prey to his beloved grizzlies, to uncover a more pervasive and troubling trend toward sensationalism, extreme risk-taking, and even abuse in wildlife films. He tracks the roots of this trend to the early days of the genre, and he profiles a new breed of skilled, ethical filmmakers whose work enlightens as well as entertains, and who represent the future that Palmer envisions for the industry he loves.",

Whether you are already vegetarian or you simply want to reduce the amount of meat in your diet, making the right dietary choices to support you and your baby is the key to a safe, healthy pregnancy. Fulfilling every nutritional guideline recommended by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Your Vegetarian Pregnancy is the first authoritative guide to maintaining a healthy plant-based diet before, during, and after the birth of your child. Combining complete obstetrical information with sound nutritional guidance, this guide will educate you about: -Basic pregnancy issues, such as fetal development, changes within your body, and preparation for labor and delivery. -What to expect each month, and how to cope with the unexpected. -Key nutrients for your baby and you, with suggestions on how to obtain these through diet, vitamins, and supplements. -The myriad benefits to eating vegetarian during pregnancy, in an entire chapter comparing vegetarian and nonvegetarian nutrition. With this unique and accessible handbook, you can be confident that your vegetarian pregnancy will be wonderfully beneficial for both you and your baby.",

Now, along with a beautiful engineer, Savita Sajan, Koster must race to decode Franklin\u2019s journal before it falls into the hands of those who would do anything, kill anyone, to suppress it. But in a world of secret societies, ancient conspiracies, and Masonic puzzles, locating the prize is one thing \u2026 staying alive, another.For as Koster and Sajan are about to learn, the same key that unlocks the doorway to Heaven \u2026 could open the portals of Hell.",
