        "Description": "Throughout history there have been women, endowed with curiosity and abundant spirit, who stepped out of the cave, cast off the shackles of expectation, and struck out for new territory. In this ode to bold, brash, and sometimes just plain dangerous women, Barbara Holland reanimates those rebels who defied convention and challenged authority on a truly grand scale: they traveled the world, commanded pirate ships, spied on the enemy, established foreign countries, scaled 19,000-foot passes, and lobbied to change the Constitution. Some were merry and flamboyant; others depressive and solitary. Some dressed up as men; others cherished their Victorian gowns. Many were ambivalent or absentminded mothers. But every one of them was fearless, eccentric, and fiercely independent. Barbara Holland evokes their energy in this unconventional book that will acquaint you with the likes of Grace O\u2019Malley, a blazing terror of the Irish seas in the 1500s, and surprise you with a fresh perspective on legends like Bonnie Parker of \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d fame. With wit, wisdom, and irreverent flair, They Went Whistling makes a compelling case for the virtue of getting into trouble.",

        "Description": "When Rudolph Diesel invented his engine in the late nineteenth century, he envisioned a device that could run anywhere on a wide range of local fuels. A century later, Greg Pahl recalls that vision and shows us it is possible with Biodiesel: Growing a New Energy Economy.Biodiesel is:more biodegradable than sugar and less toxic than table salt.produced from domestic feedstocks, reducing the need for foreign oil while boosting the local economy and supporting the agricultural community.Biodiesel can:reduce net CO2 emissions by 78 percent compared with petroleum diesel fuel, cutting greenhouse gases that lead to global warming.be mixed with petroleum diesel at any level to produce a cleaner-burning biodiesel blend.be blended with No. 2 oil for home heating, usually without any retrofits required.As the politics of energy grow bleak, visionary entrepreneurs in the biofuels industry may very well become society's next great hope-heroes to today's energy insecurity the way astronauts were to the Cold War's space race. In Biodiesel, Greg Pahl delves into the history of the biofuels industry. He assesses its recent successes and current shortcomings, and stands well prepared to estimate its future. If the political, environmental, or financial woes of our current fuel industry have you concerned, it's time to take another look at biodiesel!",

Our government spends too much; our economy creates too little; and we aren't preparing our children to compete in a global marketplace. Yet our politicians - Republican and Democrat alike - just don't get it. While once-great cities fall into decay, Washington thrives, living off the hard work and tax dollars of the private sector. It's time for an American comeback -- and it starts with innovation.   Throughout its history, America's great innovators have been the drivers of our unsurpassed economic success. American innovation transformed a country of ragtag farmers into the epicenter of the world's technological progress. Innovation creates jobs, markets, and new industries where none existed before. Most importantly, innovation moves us forward as a nation, pushing us to succeed and strive for a better tomorrow. In short, innovation is the American Dream. In The Comeback, Gary Shapiro shows us how to return innovation to its rightful place at the center of America's economic policy. The Comeback is a new blueprint for America's success.",

It's not just some Polish bloke who wanted to get home.  It's about how we all struggle on every day.  Somehow or other we find a reason to keep on going and it's the same here but on an epic scale\".--Benedict Allen, explorer and bestselling author of Into the Abyss and Edge of Blue Heaven *** In 1941, the author and six fellow prisoners of war escaped a Soviet labor camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, and untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday feats. Their march\u2014over thousands of miles by foot\u2014out of Siberia, through China, the Gobi Desert, Tibet, and over the Himalayas to British India is a remarkable statement about man\u2019s desire to be free.   Written in a hauntingly detailed, no-holds-barred way, the book inspired the Peter Wier film The Way Back, due for release in late 2010. Previous editions have sold hundreds of thousands of copies; this edition includes an afterword written by the author shortly before his death, as well as the author's introduction to the book's Polish edition.   Guaranteed to forever stay in the reader's mind, The Long Walk will remain a testament to the strength of the human spirit, and the universal desire for freedom and dignity.   *** Six-time Academy Award\u2013nominee Peter Weir (Master and Commander, The Truman Show, and The Dead Poets Society) recently directed The Way Back, a much-anticipated film based on The Long Walk. Starring Colin Farrell, Jim Sturgess, and Ed Harris, it is due for release in late 2010.",

        "Description": "Break the manufacturing mold--and make new paths to phenomenal growth In a world of emerging markets, changing work forces, and accelerating innovation, manufacturing is once again a key corporate issue. Manufacturing expertise is a strategic competitive advantage, distinguishing winning companies (like Procter & Gamble, Lego, Toyota, Zara, and Tata) from those that have let their capabilities languish. It may not be easy to take back control of production, target sources for scarce (and environmentally sustainable) materials, and cultivate a motivated, talented labor force. But there are ways to do it; and successful companies will need to learn how. The thought leaders at Booz & Company and strategy+business magazine have collaborated to create an up-to-the-minute exploration of a new era in manufacturing and the requisite strategies for success. Chock full of profiles of the best manufacturing innovations in every business sector from pharmaceuticals to autos to consumer products, and revealing the most effective manufacturing innovations and strategies, Make or Break introduces you to the forces reshaping the industry. The secrets are in this book, including how to meet such interrelated challenges as:Labor relationships and modernization Material shortages Career development of your workforce Expansion of variety Competition on a global scale  Complexity solution Environmental issues Integration of resilience into your strategy Based on leading-edge research, Make or Break is a book for leaders of the manufacturing function, but it is also for any corporate executive who wants to lead his or her industry-and for students and researchers seeking to understand why making products will, once again, be seen as the most vital skill set for a vibrant economy.",

        "Title": "Passing On The Comfort : The War, The Quilts, and the Women Who Made a Difference",
        "Authors": "By Keuning-Tichelaar, An and Kaplanian-Buller, Lynn",
        "Description": "This is a story with many parts and pieces, quite scattered in the beginning. Amazingly, the many pieces have come together to form a design that none of us imagined at first. First there is An in Holland in the early 1940s, fighting to keep the War from taking over her young, promising life. Met with unspeakable horrors, she takes risks that would confound the bravest of souls. At the same time, groups of women across North America meet in sewing circles, making quilts&#151;and then bundling them up and sending them off to do their part to give comfort and courage and respite during the War.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I, Lynn, come 20-some years later, showing up in Amsterdam in the early 1970s, a little rebellious and tired of another war. I didn't know An, and quilts were not something I ever made. But my grandmother and aunts, and other older women in my childhood church, did. And I knew an immigrant's longing for the textures of home. We have scattered images of 19 quilts, which eventually emerge near the heart of this story, throughout the book. These quilts drew An and me to each other. We'll put this story together a little like a quilt top&#151;here a patch, there a patch, until the design emerges, startlingly cohesive. Terrible odds. Determined women. Quilts, well-worn from having been called into active duty.",

        "Title": "Morning Miracle: Inside the Washington Post A Great Newspaper Fights for Its Life",
        "Authors": "By Kindred, Dave",
        "Description": "An in-depth look at the Washington Post from a Pulitzer Prize\u2013nominated Post veteran. Morning Miracle definitively answers the question \u201cDo newspapers still matter?\u201d with a resounding yes.What The Kingdom and the Power did for the New York Times, Morning Miracle will do for the Washington Post. A reporter for more than forty years, Dave Kindred takes you inside the heart of the legendary newspaper and offers a unique opportunity to see what it really takes to produce world-class journalism every day. Granted unprecedented access to every nook and cranny of the paper, including candid exchanges with its most celebrated journalists, such as Bob Woodward, Sally Quinn, David Broder, and former executive editor Ben Bradlee (who gave the book its title), Kindred provides a no-holds-barred look at the twenty-first-century newsroom. As it becomes more difficult to maintain journalistic integrity, stay relevant in the age of blogs, and meet Wall Street\u2019s demands for profits, the newspaper\u2014more than any other medium\u2014also shoulders the tremendous responsibility of acting as a watchdog for democracy. Perhaps no one sums up the overwhelming challenges that face the Post and its power to endure better than the author himself: \u201cIt is still a miracle that you can put 700 overcaffeinated misfits in a newsroom, on deadline, adrenaline running, secrets to spill, and before midnight a messenger delivers a smoking-hot city edition to Don Graham\u2019s manse in Georgetown.\u201d",
