The Soviets feared another revival of German nationalism and sought to defend themselves against another German invasion. The U.S. and its allies created NATO to balance a Soviet military buildup, including the nuclear arms race. The first confrontation with Communist guerrilla action in Greece and Soviet threats against Turkey were followed by Communist party threats to overthrow democratic governments in France and Italy and later all around the world. The U.S. supplied vast military and economic assistance to thwart their efforts. The Soviet government, consequently, felt obliged to assist governments whom they considered threatened by the \"imperialists,\" principally the United States.",

        "Description": "Best Little Ironies, Oddities, and Mysteries of the Civil War is a collection of more than 100 stories of unusual and frequently surprising events that took place in connection with the Civil War. Organized by topics into seven sections, the stories include ironies that grew out of incidents that took place prior to the war, the unexpected consequences of events and the early days of the conflict, twists and turns of fate among soldiers, civilians and officers, and postwar happenings.  All of these stories are written from a journalistic history approach that looks for the \"feature story\" aspects in the war's events, including:   William \"Mudwall\" Jackson, who - as a lawyer, judge, and lieutenant governor of Virginia - would have been far better known than his cousin \"Stonewall\" Jackson had war not broken out. The man in charge of quelling John Brown's uprising at Harpers Ferry in 1859, surprisingly none other than Robert E. Lee. Jeff Greenwold of Anoka, Minnesota, who was the first volunteer of the first regiment to organize to fight for the Union. Brig. Gen. Robert Gannett, who was the first general officer of either side to be killed in battle. An unnamed Union soldier who broke down in tears following the battle of Williamsburg at the sight of a dead Confederate soldier, then kissed his enemy - his brother. John Taylor Wood, whose grandfather had been president of the United States, whose father was a 36-year veteran in the Union army, but whose aunt was married to Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Frank Crawford Armstrong, who served in both the Confederate and Union armies. Union officer Orton Williams - raised by Robert E. Lee and his wife at Arlington house after Williams had been orphaned - who later informed Mary Lee that Federal troops would be coming to occupy her home the next day.",

        "Title": "The Buddha from Brooklyn",
        "Authors": "By Sherrill, Martha",
        "Description": "In 1985, Catharine Burroughs was a Maryland housewife with two children\u2014and two failed marriages behind her\u2014running a New Age prayer group in her basement. Out of the blue, a monastery in India for which she had raised some money contacted Burroughs and asked her to host His Holiness Penor Rinpoche, one of the highest-ranking lamas of Tibetan Buddhism, on his first visit to America. After meeting Burroughs, and observing her and her followers for a period of five days, he told her that she was a \"great, great bodhisattva,\" and already, unbeknownst to her, practicing Buddhism. Later, in India,    he officially recognized this Jewish-Italian woman from Brooklyn as the reincarnation of a sixteenth-century Ti-betan saint, making her the first American woman to be named a tulku, or reborn lama. The Buddha from Brooklyn tells the complex and fascinating story of how Catharine Burroughs, now known as Jetsunma Ahk\u00f6n Lhamo, embarked on a journey to build the largest Tibetan Buddhist center in America. With boundless enthusiasm but precious little formal training in Buddhist practices and traditions, Jetsunma and her students bought an estate in Poolesville, Maryland, on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., and founded Kunzang Palyul Choling (Fully Awakened Dharma Continent of Absolute Clear Light). Under Jetsunma's tutelage, the group memorized sacred texts and held all-night prayer vigils. They asked venerable Tibetan lamas to visit and give them \"empowerments.\" Many took Buddhist vows and became monks and nuns. And as word of this remarkable place spread, others came to see the new lama for themselves and joined her community.Martha Sherrill, a writer at The Washington Post, heard about Jetsunma in 1993. She visited the center and was charmed by both its charismatic lama, the only Western woman in the male-dominated hierarchy of Tibetan Buddhism, and by the monks and nuns (all Americans) living there. They seemed, for the most part, like a remarkably happy group of people whose lives had been transformed by this exotic, imported faith\u2014and by Jetsunma. At the beginning of The Buddha from Brooklyn, as the group is breaking ground for a sacred monument called a stupa, Sherrill commences her own journey to   discover for herself what makes this unlikely lama\u2014who enjoys clothes shopping and manicures, Motown music and Star Trek reruns\u2014such a magnetic spiritual leader. And as the story unfolds, so do the secrets of this seemingly idyllic sanctuary. Compassionate and clear-eyed, Sherrill takes her readers on a breathtaking exploration inside the monastery at Poolesville, a place where idealistic but flawed human beings struggle with their devotion every day. She demystifies monastic life and Tibetan Buddhism, and amends   the simplified view that most Americans have of this 2,500-year-old faith. Weaving together the stories of the believers into a narrative structure that is as moving and beautiful as the stupa they are building, Sherrill has created a  brilliant work of investigative journalism that raises profound, provocative questions about religious faith and its price. The Buddha from Brooklyn is a monument to the miracles and failures that stem from the deepest human longings.",

        "Authors": "By Gherman, Beverly",
        "Description": "He was a pale, skinny boy with thick glasses, but Norman Perceval Rockwell knew that he could draw.  Beverly Gherman shows us how this awkward boy grew up to become a famous illustrator. As a boy, he sketched the characters from Charles Dickens's novels at the kitchen table. And although his mother discouraged him from pursuing a career in art, Norman knew early on that he could not ignore his talent. He dropped out of school at age fourteen to study art and begin the career that would eventually capture the heart of his entire nation.  The experiences of Rockwell's life became part of his paintings: a childhood trip to the country, his son's departure for the Air Force, the fire that destroyed his studio. He also depicted world events and people of his time: Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic Ocean, the soldiers of World War II, and the children involved in school integration, as well as more intimate American scenes, such as a family dinner or a trip to the doctor's office.  Beverly Gherman paints a colorful and engaging portrait of Norman Rockwell's life, enhanced by full-color reproductions of the artist's own paintings, which tell both his story and their own.",

        "Description": "Once in a great while, a book comes along that not only discusses a topic of interest, it changes the boundaries of that discussion forever. This is such a book. In How Israel Lost Richard Ben Cramer analyzes the four questions that have bedeviled Israel and Palestine for almost forty years:  I. Why Do We Care About Israel?  II. Why Don't the Palestinians Have a State?  III. What Is a Jewish State?  IV. Why Is There No Peace?  With personal observation and sharp and challenging argument, Cramer insists that Israel is losing her soul by maintaining her occupation of the lands conquered in the Six Day War. Israel has become a victim of that occupation no less than the Palestinians, who must have a nation of their own. Cramer makes clear for the first time why the occupation endures and how it corrupts and corrodes the societies of both Arab and Jew.  Cramer's portrait of those societies is both up to the minute and timeless, enlivened at every step by his trademark humor, by humane understanding of the people caught in the conflict, and by his astonishing gift for language, theirs and ours. Both his observations and arguments are drawn with startling clarity, informed by the fierce and fearless reporting that won him the Pulitzer Prize for Middle East coverage twenty-five years ago.  The result is a book destined to produce both heat and light -- it is both shocking and a delight to read. This is journalism so sharp that it will change the story it set out to tell.

        "Title": "Ally to Adversary: An Eyewitness Account of Iraq's Fall from Grace",
        "Authors": "By Francona, Rick",
        "Description": "Much has been written about the Iran-Iraq War, Desert Storm, and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, but until now no one has chronicled the perilous, spiraling course of U.S.-Iraqi relations from inside the highest military and diplomatic levels. In this revealing firsthand account, career intelligence officer and Arabic linguist Rick Francona takes the reader on an unforgettable odyssey from the battlefields of the Iran-Iraq War, to the top secret tactical decision-making meetings of the Desert Storm coalition forces, to the actual surrender at Safwan by Iraqi officials, many of whom he had worked with previously as allies.As the point man for the highly sensitive support the United States gave Iraq in 1987-1988, during its war with Iran, Francona walked the streets of Baghdad, toured military facilities, and established close relations with high-ranking Iraqis. Through these activities he gained a unique and valuable perspective of Iraq's military capabilities and doctrine, including its use of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons. Later, as General Norman Schwarzkopf's personal interpreter, he shared in the successes, failures, and frustrations of political and military planning and prosecution during Desert Shield and Desert Storm. From the author's sparkling, informative prose, the reader discovers how the delicate coalition of international forces was developed and maintained despite contentious parochialism that threatened to divide the force and even U.S. services. Francona sheds considerable new light on the strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. and coalition intelligence efforts and explodes myths surrounding their methods and results.Objective, revealing, and often humorous, this unprecedented peek inside the closed doors of U.S. and international military decision-making documents an important epoch of U.S. and Middle East history and offers many lessons and warnings for current and future relations.",

        "Description": "Spanning two thousand years of stirring religious, cultural and political events, this lavishly illustrated volume--the latest addition to the acclaimed Oxford Illustrated History series--provides the most authoritative and accessible history of Christianity ever published for the general reader.        The impact of Christianity on world civilization is almost incalculable, and in exploring this rich heritage, nineteen leading scholars range from the earliest origins to the present day to examine virtually every aspect of the faith. They discuss the apostle Peter and Roman Emperor Constantine, describe the role of Charlemagne in the expansion of the religion, and assess medieval scholasticism and the influence of Thomas Aquinas. The profound changes that occurred during both the Reformation and the Enlightenment are fully treated in chapters that offer revealing portraits of such key figures as Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, and Rousseau. Fully one third of the book covers Christianity since 1800--with special studies of the faith as practiced in Britain and Europe, North and South America, Africa, India, and the Far East--offering a compelling continuous narrative filled with insight into the enormously diverse Christian world. In the final chapters, the authors consider questions of contemporary Christian theology, conscience and belief, and explore new concepts of Christian community.       Over 350 beautiful illustrations--including 32 full color plates--grace the text, ranging from mosaics, paintings and sculptures, to architecture and modern art. There are also ten maps, a chronology of important events, and an annotated guide to further reading.       Throughout, the book reflects the changing world in which Christians have found themselves, and the many ways in which, individually and through the institutions of the church, they in turn have influenced history. Comprehensive, vividly narrated, and exquisitely produced, this magnificent book captures the richness and vitality of Christian thought and culture throughout the ages. It is hard to imagine a more meaningful holiday gift.",

But the greatest dream of the dragonriders was to find a way to eradicate Thread completely, so that never again would their beloved Pern be threatened with destruction.Now, for the first time, it looks as if that dream can come true. For when the people of Pern, led by Masterharper Robinton and F'lar and Lessa, Weyrleader and Weyrwoman of Bendon Weyr, excavate the ancient remains of the planet's original settlement, they uncover the colonists' voice-activated artificial intelligence system\u2014which still functions.

        "Description": "With over one million novels in print, New York Times best-selling author Joel C. Rosenberg has been called \u201ceerily prophetic\u201d and a \u201cmodern Nostradamus\u201d for his uncanny ability to write political thrillers that come true. In his first nonfiction book, this evangelical Christian from an Orthodox Jewish heritage takes readers on an unforgettable journey through prophecy and current events into the future of Iraq after Saddam, Russia after Communism, Israel after Arafat, and Christianity after radical Islam. You won't want to miss Joel's exclusive interviews with Israeli, Palestinian, and Russian leaders, and previously classified CIA and White House documents. Similar to the approach Joel takes in his novels, his desire is to draw readers into stories, anecdotes, and predictions in a way that builds confidence that allows Joel to share his faith in Jesus Christ and the reliability of Scripture as a guide to understanding the past and the future. Drawing on his experience in Washington, his own exclusive interviews with world leaders, and his astute political acumen, Joel makes sense of the events surrounding the Middle East. He connects information in a way that will make you understand and really care about the world's most important events and how they impact your life\u2014from gas prices to your bank account. Epicenter is about: Change\u2014big changes, dramatic changes, changes that will transform the world as we know it  Answers\u2014what the changes are underway in the world's most important countries Insight\u2014readers will understand the trajectory of world events by being taken inside the governments of Iran, Iraq, Russia, China, and more Accessibility\u2014aimed for a wide audience in both the general and Christian markets Faith\u2014Joel shares his faith in Jesus Christ and the reliability of Scripture Epicenter will answer questions like:  Will Iraq go from bad to worse?  Will Israel and her Arab neighbors find peace, or is another major Middle East war just around the corner?  If the new, post-Soviet Russia is our friend, why is the Kremlin creating a new class of thermonuclear weapons and building an alliance with radical Islam?",

        "Title": "Super Sexual Orgasm: Discover the Ultimate Pleasure Spot: The Cul-de-Sac",
        "Authors": "By Keesling, Barbara",
        "Description": "Imagine: An explosive vaginal orgasm that doesn&#39;t require a perfect sex partner. An orgasm without exhaustion or convoluted gymnastics. An orgasm that you control. Thanks to Barbara Keesling, Ph.D., this type of sexual fulfillment can now be any woman&#39;s reality. Dr. Keesling has identified the cul-de-sac -- an area of extreme sensitivity in the vaginal canal that enables any woman to have a Super Sexual Orgasm! Normally hidden beneath the uterus and just beyond the cervix, the cul-de-sac is so extraordinarily rich in sensitive nerve endings that the slightest contact can trigger a powerful, consuming, instantaneous orgasm.To reveal this secret and bring this ultimate sensation into your sex life, Dr. Keesling has devised a series of simple exercises designed to tighten the PC muscle, lift and flatten the uterus, and expose the usually hidden cul-de-sac. These exercises can work for all women -- from the highly orgasmic to the silent majority who have been suffering snoregasms. The cul-de-sac will become a woman&#39;s best-loved secret, for it will allow her to have consistent, euphoric orgasms that she can fully control. Dr. Keesling also includes sensual exercises for women to practice after they have mastered the Super Sexual Orgasm and exercises for couples to practice together, so that women can fully incorporate Super Sexual Orgasm into their lives in a mind-body-spirit approach.Barbara Keesling, Ph.D., is the author of Talk Sexy to the One You Love, How to Make Love All Night  &nbsp and  Sexual Pleasure. She has taught human sexuality and psychopathology at several southern California universities.\"What is the one word that is pivotal to female sexuality? Control.What I&#39;m saying is this: Women want to have control of their sexual energies. They want to fully enjoy every scintilla of their lovemaking, from sensual caressing to supersonic climaxes, and once you discover the magic of Super Sexual Orgasm, you will be able to decide if you want to have your explosive climax at the beginning of intercourse or wait till your partner is on the verge of orgasm or have multiple explosive orgasms or have it all! All of this is available to you. You will have the control. Isn&#39;t this what you want?\"  -- Barbara Keesling, Ph.D.",

It has become far too easy to ignore the hardships of millions of children plagued by poverty, poor health, illiteracy, violence, adult hypocrisy, and injustice. As founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman knows all too well the suffering of so many of our nation's children, who live every day with adversity most of us can barely imagine. In The Sea Is So Wide and My Boat Is So Small, Edelman asks difficult questions about what we truly value, and looks hard at what we can--and must--do to build a nation fit for all children. With the passion and conviction that have made her our leading child advocate, she calls us all to stand up for the future of America. What have we done and what have we left undone? What lessons can we learn from our past and our present to realize a just and peaceful national and world vision for our children and grandchildren? Marian Wright Edelman challenges all of us--our leaders, our teachers, the faith community, parents, grandparents, and future generations--to end the epidemic physical and spiritual poverty afflicting millions of our children. We can leave our children with a better, safer, and fairer world if we care enough. And we can--and must--do it now.",

But as this provocative, visionary book argues, this approach perpetuates a one-way, \"cradle to grave\" manufacturing model that dates to the Industrial Revolution and casts off as much as 90 percent of the materials it uses as waste, much of it toxic. Why not challenge the notion that human industry must inevitably damage the natural world?In fact, why not take nature itself as our model? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we do not consider its abundance wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective; hence, \"waste equals food\" is the first principle the book sets forth. Products might be designed so that, after their useful life, they provide nourishment for something new-either as \"biological nutrients\" that safely re-enter the environment or as \"technical nutrients\" that circulate within closed-loop industrial cycles, without being \"downcycled\" into low-grade uses (as most \"recyclables\" now are). Elaborating their principles from experience (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, William McDonough and Michael Braungart make an exciting and viable case for change.",

        "Title": "Danger's Hour: The Story of the USS Bunker Hill and the Kamikaze Pilot Who Crippled Her",
        "Authors": "By Kennedy, Maxwell Taylor",
        "Description": "In the closing months of World War II, Americans found themselves facing a new and terrifying weapon: kamikazes -- the first men to use airplanes as suicide weapons.By the beginning of 1945, American pilots were shooting down Japanese planes more than ten to one. The Japanese had so few metals left that the military had begun using wooden coins and clay pots for hand grenades. For the first time in 800 years, Japan faced imminent invasion. As Germany faltered, the combined strength of every warring nation gathered at Japan's door. Desperate, Japan turned to its most idealistic young men -- the best and brightest college students -- and demanded of them the greatest sacrifice.On the morning of May 11, 1945, days after the Nazi surrender, the USS Bunker Hill -- a magnificent vessel that held thousands of crewmen and the most sophisticated naval technology available -- was holding at the Pacific Theater, 70 miles off the coast of Okinawa.At precisely 9:58 a.m., Kiyoshi Ogawa radioed in to his base at Kanoya, 350 miles from the Bunker Hill, \"I found the enemy vessels.\" After eighteen months of training, Kiyoshi tucked a comrade's poem into his breast pocket and flew his Zero five hours across the Pacific. Now the young Japanese pilot had located his target and was on the verge of fulfilling his destiny. At 10:02.30 a.m., as he hovered above the Bunker Hill, hidden in a mass of clouds, Kiyoshi spoke his last words: \"Now, I am nose-diving into the ship.\"The attack killed 393 Americans and was the worst suicide attack against America until September 11. Juxtaposing Kiyoshi's story with the stories of untold heroism of the men aboard the Bunker Hill, Maxwell Taylor Kennedy details how American sailors and airmen worked together, risking their own lives to save their fellows and ultimately triumphing in their efforts to save their ship.Drawing on years of research and firsthand interviews with both American and Japanese survivors, Maxwell Taylor Kennedy draws a gripping portrait of men bravely serving their countries in war and the advent of a terrifying new weapon, suicide bombing, that nearly halted the most powerful nation in the world.",

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader&#39;s understanding of these enduring works. In her final novel, as in her earlier ones, Jane Austen uses a love story to explore and gently satirize social pretensions and emotional confusion. Persuasion follows the romance of Anne Elliot and naval officer Frederick Wentworth. They were happily engaged until Anne\u2019s friend, Lady Russell, persuaded her that Frederick was \u201cunworthy.\u201d Now, eight years later, Frederick returns, a wealthy captain in the navy, while Anne\u2019s family teeters on the edge of bankruptcy. They still love each other, but their past mistakes threaten to keep them apart. Austen may seem to paint on a small canvas, but her characters contain the full range of human passion and moral complexity, and the author\u2019s generous spirit renders them all with understanding, compassion, and humor.",

Warlord is the definitive chronicle of Churchill's crucial role as one of the world's most renowned military leaders, from his early adventures on the North-West Frontier of colonial India and the Boer War through his extraordinary service in both World Wars. Even though Churchill became one of the towering political leaders of the twentieth century, his childhood ambition was to be a soldier. Using extensive, untapped archival materials, D'Este reveals important and untold observations from Churchill's personal physician, as well as other colleagues and family members, in order to illuminate his character as never before. Warlord explores Churchill's strategies behind the major military campaigns of World War I and World War II\u2014both his dazzling successes and disastrous failures\u2014while also revealing his tumultuous relationships with his generals and other commanders, including Dwight D. Eisenhower. As riveting as the man it portrays, Warlord is a masterful, unsparing portrait of one of history's most fascinating and influential leaders during what was arguably the most crucial event in human history.",
