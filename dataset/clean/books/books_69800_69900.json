        "Authors": "By McLean, Bethany and Elkind, Peter",
        "Description": "The definitive volume on Enron's amazing rise and scandalous fall, from an award-winning team of Fortune investigative reporters.  There were dozens of books about Watergate, but only All the President's Men gave readers the full story, with all the drama and nuance and exclusive reporting. And thirty years later, if you're going to read only one book on Watergate, that's still the one. Today, Enron is the biggest business story of our time, and Fortune senior writers Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind are the new Woodward and Bernstein.  Remarkably, it was just two years ago that Enron was thought to epitomize a great New Economy company, with its skyrocketing profits and share price. But that was before Fortune published an article by McLean that asked a seemingly innocent question: How exactly does Enron make money? From that point on, Enron's house of cards began to crumble. Now, McLean and Elkind have investigated much deeper, to offer the definitive book about the Enron scandal and the fascinating people behind it.  Meticulously researched and character driven, Smartest Guys in the Room takes the reader deep into Enron's past-and behind the closed doors of private meetings. Drawing on a wide range of unique sources, the book follows Enron's rise from obscurity to the top of the business world to its disastrous demise. It reveals as never before major characters such as Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Andy Fastow, as well as lesser known players like Cliff Baxter and Rebecca Mark. Smartest Guys in the Room is a story of greed, arrogance, and deceit-a microcosm of all that is wrong with American business today. Above all, it's a fascinating human drama that will prove to be the authoritative account of the Enron scandal.",

        "Title": "Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gerhig",
        "Authors": "By Eig, Jonathan",
        "Description": "Lou Gehrig was the Iron Horse, baseball's strongest and most determined superstar -- struck down in his prime by a disease that now bears his name. But who was Lou Gehrig, really? What fueled his ferocious competitive drive? How did he cope with the illness that abruptly ended his career and drained him of his legendary power? Drawing on dozens of new interviews and hundreds of pages of Gehrig's personal and previously unpublished letters, this definitive biography gives us a deeper, more intimate understanding of the life of an American hero.  Lou Gehrig is regarded as the greatest first baseman in baseball history. A muscular but clumsy athlete, he grew up in New York City, the sole survivor among four siblings. He idolized his hardworking mother and remained devoted to her all his life. Shy and socially awkward, especially around women, Gehrig was a misfit on a Yankee team that included drinkers and hell-raisers, most notably Babe Ruth. Gehrig's wife, Eleanor, was an ambitious young woman who pursued him and persuaded him to embrace his growing stardom. For years, rumors have persisted that she and Ruth had an affair, and that this was the event that ended the friendship between the two ballplayers.  Gehrig and Ruth formed the greatest slugging tandem in baseball history. They were the heart of the first great Yankee dynasty. After Ruth's retirement, Gehrig and a young Joe DiMaggio would begin a new era of Yankee dominance. But Luckiest Man reveals that Gehrig was afflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) much sooner than anyone believed, as early as the spring of 1938. Despite the illness, he didn't miss a game that year, keeping intact his astonishing consecutive-games streak, which stood for more than half a century.  After he was diagnosed, Gehrig's doctors allowed him to believe he had a fifty-fifty chance of surviving what they knew to be a fatal illness. The same doctor who wrote him encouraging letters secretly wrote Eleanor Gehrig to tell her the terrible truth. But even as his body deteriorated and Gehrig realized he was dying, he never despaired. In his final months Gehrig proved himself truly to be the Iron Horse. The man who spoke spontaneously from the heart when he gave his great speech at his farewell in Yankee Stadium continued to sound the same themes: that he'd led a good life and had much to be thankful for.  In Luckiest Man Jonathan Eig brings to life a figure whose shyness and insecurity obscured his greatness during his lifetime. Gehrig emerges on these pages as more human and heroic than ever.",

        "Description": "Nothing evokes comfort, warmth, and mouth-watering hospitality like the dishes prepared by people who actually grow the food. From Susan Herrmann Loomis, author of The French Farmhouse Cookbook, The Italian Farmhouse Cookbook, The Great American Seafood Cookbook, and Clambakes & Fish Fries, Farmhouse Cookbook is the result of a 20,000-mile trek across rural America in search of the soul of the family farm. Passionate in her quest to taste the freshest corn, understand the basics of cattle ranching, and find out just how an artichoke grows, the author contacted legions of farmers who generously shared their time, their knowledge, their homes, and their recipes. Although Farmhouse Cookbook includes the best pot roast, meat loaf, and stew you're ever likely to encounter, it goes well beyond the expected meat-and-potatoes fare. Here is Chew Chang's Chicken and Mustard Green Soup, Lentil Salad with Smoked Turkey and Tarragon, Pork Loin with Coriander and Garlic Crust, a Basque Fourteen-Hour Leg of Lamb, Lemony Herbed Chicken Wings, Nate Pennell's Mulligan Stew with Blueberry Dumplings, Amish Corn Pudding, and Mary Navarette's Garlicky Enchiladas, from the Christopher Farm in Gilroy, California, the garlic capital of the world. Plus, extraordinary baking-Hot Pepper Corn Bread, Funny Cake, Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookies, Rhubarb Crunch, Sour Cherry Crumb Pie, and Best Ever Chocolate Cake. With profiles of farms and farmers, tips, lore, and an almond to zucchini lexicon, Farmhouse Cookbook is as irresistible as the ring of the dinner bell over the fields.

Mass arrests, feverish attempts to arm for self-defense, vigilante actions and irrational accusations became the order of the day. Far more than ideological or economic motives, it was this atmosphere, Steven Channing argues, that predisposed South Carolinians toward the great defiance that would end the Union. It provided the framework in which the radical politicians, at once exploiting the fear and dominated by it, were able to outmaneuver the Unionists and bring about secession.",

        "Description": "On the day Corbitt Wainwright's father is imprisoned for attacking a white man, the thirteen-year-old's adolescence is abruptly cut short. Dreams of success through good grades and hard work are wiped aside as white society shows him, out of both kindness and malice, that poor black kids in Mississippi don't have much of a hand in creating their own destinies. But Corbitt refuses to accept his allotted role, and after a deadly confrontation with his father's accuser, he sets out for California, the land of opportunity and racial equality.What he finds on arriving in West Oakland is another world altogether, a world populated by gangs and crack dealers, violent cops and street kids, where opportunity seems to run even thinner than it does back home. But when he falls in with some local home boys and helps them overcome one of their many predators, Corbitt discovers the power of his African heritage. He learns, finally, to trust his own strength.Peopled by a remarkable cast of characters and written with the gut-wrenching immediacy, cutting-edge street slang, and haunting lyricism that have marked Jess Mowry as a bold new voice in fiction, Six Out Seven is a brutally honest novel about what it means to be a black teenager in the United States today. Wryly funny, deeply committed, it is a portrait of America no reader should miss.",

        "Description": "The Bill of Rights, perhaps the single most important document in American history, has provided a strong and remarkably durable framework in which the limits of government, the scope of individual liberty, and the nature of our democratic system have been defined for more than two hundred years. In the past several decades in particular, the American Bill of Rights has been subject to virtually continual reinterpretation by the U.S. Supreme Court through a series of landmark cases, while its provisions also have exerted a powerful influence over the movement toward democracy and freedom worldwide. This third edition of The Bill of Rights, the Courts, and the Law serves to increase public understanding of the Bill of Rights and the American judicial process by presenting select cases and their underlying issues fairly. It allows readers to examine the various legal arguments with the help of expert commentary, offering the best, most accessible introduction to the Bill of Rights available to a nonscholarly audience.Contributors.
