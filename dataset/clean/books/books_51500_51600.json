        "Authors": "By Faux, Geoffrey P.",
        "Description": "Acclaim for The Global Class War\"\"You will never think about 'free trade' the same way after reading Jeff Faux's superb book. As Faux makes clear, the globalization debate is really about whose interests are served by global elites, and how we need to go about reclaiming a democracy that serves ordinary people. This book should transform public discourse in America.\"\"-Robert Kuttner, founding coeditor of the American Prospect and a contributing columnist to BusinessWeek\"\"Jeff Faux's astonishing story of how class works will scandalize the best names in Wall Street and Washington-especially the much admired Robert Rubin, who along with other elites colluded behind the backs of ordinary citizens in Mexico, Canada, and the United States. The most cynical Americans will be shocked by the sordid details. This really is an important book.\"\"-William Greider, author of The Soul of Capitalism and Secrets of the Temple\"\"Globalization is a cover for American imperialism, but the beneficiaries are not the American people at the expense of foreigners but corporate executives at the expense of working-class and poor people wherever they may be. Jeff Faux offers a comprehensive and devastating analysis.\"\"-Chalmers Johnson, author of The Sorrows of Empire",

She is The Confidante, a seasoned advice columnist whose practicality and good sense have guided two generations of American women in her syndicated daily column. Grace's daughter, Francine, and granddaughter, Sophie, manage the vast Dorian empire, overseeing Grace's speaking engagements, interviews, and demanding publicity schedules. But suddenly Grace does not seem right. Her razor-sharp mind is occasionally forgetful; her columns wander. Grace finds herself vehemently denying - but is clearly suffering from - the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.In a frantic struggle to regain control within the family and the business, Francine must step forth and fill her legendary mother's shoes. She must cope with Grace's mortal fear and inability to continue as The Confidante, as well as her own new role of writing her mother's column, answering her fan mail, and preserving the secret of her mother's health until Grace comes to terms with it herself. But Francine must also struggle to live her own life. Long divorced and existing in her mother's shadow, Francine battles her new role in the face of affections from Grace's doctor, a rugged and kind man whose interest leaves Francine torn between devotion to her mother and commitment to rebuilding her own life. And Francine must think of her daughter, Sophie, who at twenty-three needs Francine's guidance as much as, and perhaps more than, The Confidante's public does. Sophie watches the role reversal in her family and attempts to understand the drastic changes in a grandmother whom she has always loved but found overbearing.",

        "Title": "The Witches' Hammer",
        "Authors": "By Hitchcock, Jane Stanton",
        "Description": "Jane Stanton Hitchcock's second novel is a chilling and unpredictable story in which the powers of darkness and pathology lurk just beneath the surface of modern life.Her first novel, Trick of the Eye, was nominated for both the Edgar Award and the Hammett Prize for \"best first mystery novel.\" Now Hitchcock practices her narrative skills even more convincingly in this sinister thriller about a vulnerable young woman drawn deep into a web of evil who must unravel the coils of her own sexual identity and womanhood.Beatrice O'Connell's orderly life is shattered when her father, a gentle man preoccupied with rare-book collecting, is viciously murdered. Discovered missing from his library is a seemingly harmless fifteenth-century grimoire - a manual of black magic or, as some would believe, the \"work of the Devil.\" What is the secret of this apparently unprepossessing volume that powerful people are prepared to risk so much to possess? Does it contain a demonic spell? Or is the map for a hidden treasure buried within its timeworn pages? And so what begins with the casual acceptance of a book of black magic with obscene illustrations ends with the discovery of a vast contemporary witch-hunt.With the help of a chain-smoking occultist, a libidinous social worker in Spanish Harlem, and a remorseful ex-husband, Beatrice struggles to piece together the puzzle...in Oklahoma, where the book first surfaced; in upstate New York, home of an enormously wealthy foundation with strong ties to the Church; in London, where the daughter of a Nazi official sheds light on one corner of the dark Nazi past; in Italy, where a demented former Vatican official forces Beatrice to pay an uncompromisingly high price for a vital piece of the puzzle. And finally in Switzerland, where she must confront evil incarnate in the most direct way imaginable.Exposing evil that is at once centuries old and efficiently modern, and probing the dark paths of sexuality and madness, Jane Stanton Hitchcock has written a rich, complex, relentlessly suspenseful thriller.",

When self-styled impresario and former human cannonball Matthew Hayes rents a luxury villa on Palm Beach's famed South Ocean Boulevard, the locals roll their eyes. But when he scuttles the traditional backyard accoutrements of swimming pool and tennis court in favor of a grand garden hedge maze modeled after the one at Hampton Court, the South Florida smart set can't wait for their invitations -to the gala opening of the Amazin' Maze of Matthew Hayes.  The big night arrives and gasps of wonder and delight are replaced by those of horror, as Hayes's ladylove, Marlena Marvel, in the role of Venus, is discovered at the center of the maze, very dead indeed. Is the gruff but grieving widower somehow involved in his wife's demise? Or are there other forces-and more devious minds-at work? Hayes's carnival background and flair for the dramatic only complicate a mystery that has more false leads than his amazin' maze. It's up to Archy McNally to see through the scam and catch a killer.",

        "Authors": "By Moore, Christopher",
        "Description": "Christmas crept into Pine Cove like a creeping Christmas thing: dragging garland, ribbon, and sleigh bells, oozing eggnog, reeking of pine, and threatening festive doom like a cold sore under the mistletoe.'Twas the night (okay, more like the week) before Christmas, and all through the tiny community of Pine Cove, California, people are busy buying, wrapping, packing, and generally getting into the holiday spirit. It is the hap-hap-happiest time of the year, after all.But not everybody is feeling the joy. Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed; no, his dog hasn't run away from home. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer: Please, Santa, come back from the dead.But hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. (Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say \"Kris Kringle,\" he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen.Only Christopher Moore, the man who brought you the outrageous lost gospel Lamb and the hysterical fish tale Fluke could have devised a new holiday classic that tugs at the heartstrings and serves up a healthy slice of fruitcake to boot.Move over, Charles Dickens -- it's Christopher Moore time.",

        "Description": "Now available in trade paperback, the #1 bestselling New York Times author Glenn Beck tackles some of our country\u2019s biggest problems in this funny, outrageous, and entertaining book.Glenn Beck believes that the reason why some of our biggest problems never seem to get fixed is simple: the solutions just aren\u2019t very convenient. And as the host of a nationally syndicated radio show and a prime-time television show on CNN Headline News, Glenn Beck doesn\u2019t care much about convenience; he cares about common sense. Take the issue of poverty, for example. Over the last forty years, America\u2019s poorest cities all had one simple thing in common, but politicians will never reveal what that is (or explain how easy it would be to change). Global warming is another issue that\u2019s rife with lies and distortion. How many times have we heard that carbon dioxide is responsible for huge natural disasters that have killed millions of people? The truth is, it\u2019s actually the other way around: as CO2 has increased, deaths from extreme weather have decreased. But that would never be shown in an Al Gore slide show. Combining honesty with a biting sense of humor, An Inconvenient Book contains hundreds of these \"why have I never heard that before?\" types of facts that will leave readers wondering how political correctness, special interests, and outright stupidity have gotten us so far away from the common sense solutions this country was built on.",

        "Authors": "By Repcheck, Jack",
        "Description": "Nicolaus Copernicus gave the world perhaps the most important scientific insight of the modern age, the theory that the earth and the other planets revolve around the sun. He was also the first to proclaim that the earth rotates on its axis once every twenty-four hours. His theory was truly radical: during his lifetime nearly everyone believed that a perfectly still earth rested in the middle of the cosmos, where all the heavenly bodies revolved around it. One of the transcendent geniuses of the early Renaissance, Copernicus was also a flawed and conflicted person. A cleric who lived during the tumultuous years of the early Reformation, he may have been sympathetic to the teachings of the Lutherans. Although he had taken a vow of celibacy, he kept at least one mistress. Supremely confident intellectually, he hesitated to disseminate his work among other scholars. It fact, he kept his astronomical work a secret, revealing it to only a few intimates, and the manuscript containing his revolutionary theory, which he refined for at least twenty years, remained \"hidden among my things.\" It is unlikely that Copernicus' masterwork would ever have been published if not for a young mathematics professor named Georg Joachim Rheticus. He had heard of Copernicus' ideas, and with his imagination on fire he journeyed hundreds of miles to a land where, as a Lutheran, he was forbidden to travel. Rheticus' meeting with Copernicus in a small cathedral town in northern Poland proved to be one of the most important encounters in history.Copernicus' Secret recreates the life and world of the scientific genius whose work revolutionized astronomy and altered our understanding of our place in the world. It tells the surprising, little-known story behind the dawn of the scientific age.",

        "Title": "Feingold: A New Democratic Party",
        "Authors": "By Horwitt, Sanford D.",
        "Description": "Russ Feingold is a rarity in American politics. A staunch civil libertarian, he was the only member of the U.S. Senate who voted against the ill-conceived USA Patriot Act that was rushed through Congress in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. In 2002, while the Bush administration's fabrications and scare tactics persuaded an overwhelming majority of the Senate to vote for the Iraq war resolution, Feingold opposed it. Washington insiders thought such controversial votes could doom Feingold's 2004 reelection. But he won by a near landslide, far outdistancing his party's presidential candidate, John Kerry.   Sanford D. Horwitt writes in this timely, compelling independent biography that Russ Feingold \"represents the progressive side of the Democratic divide more clearly and authentically than any successful politician on the national stage.\" The third-term senator's willingness to take bold stands -- he was the first in the Senate to call for a timetable for redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq -- has inspired a growing number of rank-and-file Democrats across the country.   Drawing on scores of interviews and historical documents, Horwitt shows that Feingold's authenticity is deeply rooted in the old progressive tradition personified by one of his heroes, Robert M. La Follette, the legendary Wisconsin governor and U.S. senator. \"Fighting Bob\" and the other great reformers of the Progressive Era placed a high value on honest, efficient government, investment in public education, health and infrastructure, and curbs on corporate power and other wealthy interests in the political process.   Feingold became known to a national audience when he teamed up with Republican John McCain on campaign finance reform legislation. After a seven-year battle, the McCain-Feingold bill became the first major reform of the campaign laws since the Watergate era.   Feingold, who grew up in a small southeastern Wisconsin town, is a man of modest means and the grandson of Jewish immigrants. In this lively portrait, Horwitt evokes mid-century Janesville, a Republican stronghold on the banks of the Rock River, where a precocious Rusty Feingold absorbed lifelong lessons about the importance of community and personal integrity.   Beginning with his first election to public office, he has defied conventional political wisdom and long odds, Horwitt tells us, a pattern that has been repeated throughout his career. Feingold has shown how a new, reinvigorated Democratic Party can stand for progressive ideals, resist the corrupting influence of special interests and win elections.",

        "Description": "In her funny and wistful new book, Reeve Lindbergh contemplates entering a new stage in life, turning sixty, the period her mother, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, once described as \"the youth of old age.\" It is a time of life, she writes, that produces some unexpected surprises. Age brings loss, but also love; disaster, but also delight. The second-graders Reeve taught many years ago are now middle-aged; her own children grow, marry, have children themselves. \"Time flies,\" she observes, \"but if I am willing to fly with it, then I can be airborne, too.\" A milestone birthday is also an opportunity to take stock of oneself, although such self-reflection may lead to nothing more than the realization, as Reeve puts it, \"that I just seem to continue being me, the same person I was at twelve and at fifty.\" At sixty, as she observes, \"all I really can do with the rest of my life is to...feel all of it, every bit of it, as much as I can for as long as I can.\"Age is only one of many subjects that Reeve writes about with perception and insight. In northern Vermont, nature is an integral part of daily life, especially on a farm. Whether it is the arrival and departure of certain birds in spring and fall, wandering turtles, or the springtime ritual of lambing, the natural world is a constant revelation.With a wry sense of humor, Reeve contemplates the infirmities of the aging body, as well as the many new drugs that treat these maladies. Briefly considering the risks of drug dependency, she writes that \"the least we [the \"Sixties Generation\"] can do for ourselves is live up to our mythology, and take lots of drugs.\" Legal drugs, that is -- although what sustains us as we grow older is not drugs but an appreciation for life, augmented by compassion, a sense of humor, and common sense.And of course there is family -- especially with the Lindberghs. Reeve writes about discovering, thirty years after her father's death and two and a half years after her mother's, that her father had three secret families in Europe. She travels to meet them, learning to expand her self-understanding: \"daughter of,\" \"mother of,\" \"sister of\" -- sister of many more siblings than she'd known, in a family more complicated than even she had imagined.Forward from Here is a brave book, a reflective book, a funny book -- a book that will charm and fascinate anyone on the journey from middle age to the uncertain future that lies ahead.",

But what has she done?\u201d\u2014Rush Limbaugh, in an exclusive interview for Whitewash Amid all the discussion of Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s presidential prospects, the most important question is ignored: Why Hillary? How did the First Lady to a disgraced, impeached president become a presidential front-runner despite never having held elective office before 2001; her staggering number of personal, political, and financial scandals; and her leftist political agenda?The answer is that for two decades she has had the most powerful weapon in politics\u2014the national \u201cnews\u201d media\u2014shamelessly promoting her presidential aspirations.In Whitewash, L. Brent Bozell III and Tim Graham of the Media Research Center, America\u2019s preeminent media watchdog organization, expose the unprecedented media favoritism that is the real key to Hillary\u2019s political career. Marshalling stunning evidence compiled exclusively by the Media Research Center, the authors show how the media have relentlessly promoted Hillary from the moment Time magazine introduced her to the country as an \u201camalgam of Betty Crocker, Mother Teresa, and Oliver Wendell Holmes.\u201d To expose the truth about Hillary that the supposedly objective media have buried, Bozell and Graham have interviewed dozens of leading conservatives who are fighting to let Americans hear the whole story: Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, Mark Levin, Mary Matalin, Laura Ingraham, Cal Thomas, and many others.Whitewash reveals:\u2022 How the frequent claim that no one has been more investigated than Hillary Clinton is not just incorrect, but utterly absurd\u2022 How prominent female reporters admit that they\u2019re \u201crooting\u201d for Mrs. Clinton, their \u201cmascot\u201d\u2022 The surprising ways Hillary\u2019s media allies have tried to fend off Barack Obama\u2019s challenge \u2022 How the national media continue to promote Mrs. Clinton\u2019s socialist health care takeover as \u201cahead of its time\u201d\u2022 The network news anchor to whom Hillary gushed, \u201cThank you. Thank you. Thank you.\u201d \u2022 The Republican congressman who tells how the Clintons \u201cwent after\u201d him \u201cmercilessly\u201d for daring to investigate Hillary scandals\u2022 How the press ruthlessly attacks anyone in the alternative media who dares challenge HillaryMrs. Clinton\u2019s media flacks deride every negative charge against her as \u201cold news,\u201d but Whitewash shows that Hillary\u2019s pattern of deception, corruption, and overreaching political schemes has been repeated again and again precisely because the media ignore the scandalous behavior. And the pattern will be repeated in 2008 and beyond if Americans aren\u2019t exposed at last to the truth that the servile national media have obscured.",

A widower with two daughters, John was as conservative as Fiona was freewheeling, both amused and appalled by her world of high-strung designers, anorexic models, Fendi-stuffed closets, and Sir Winston, her snoring bulldog. But after Fiona impulsively invited John to the Paris couture shows, somewhere between the magic of the runway and the stroll along the Seine, she let him into her heart.

While flower sellers, costermongers, shopkeepers, and hansom drivers ply their trades, the London police watch over all. Or so people believe. . . .Early one morning, Thomas Pitt, dauntless mainstay of the Special Branch, is summoned to Long Spoon Lane, where anarchists are plotting an attack. Bombs explode, destroying the homes of many poor people. After a chase, two of the culprits are captured and the leader is shot . . . but by whom?As Pitt delves into the case, he finds that there is more to the terrorism than the destructive gestures of misguided idealists. The police are running a lucrative protection racket, and clues suggest that Inspector Wetron of Bow Street is the mastermind. As the shadowy leader of the Inner Circle, Wetron is using his influence with the press to whip up fears of more attacks\u2013and to rush a bill through Parliament that would severely curtail civil liberties. This would make him the most powerful man in the country.To defeat Wetron, Pitt finds that he must run in harness with his old enemy, Sir Charles Voisey, and the unlikely allies are joined by Pitt\u2019s clever wife, Charlotte, and her great aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould. Can they prevail? As they strive to prevent future destruction, nothing less than the fate of the British Empire hangs in precarious balance.From the first sentence to the last, Long Spoon Lane is a miracle of suspense, of plot and counterplot, bluff and counterbluff, in a take-no-prisoners battle between good and evil. It is possibly the very best of all the wonderful Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels.",

Unlike most\u00a0\u00a0writers' guides, this one had as much to do with how\u00a0\u00a0writers live as with mastering the tools of their\u00a0\u00a0trade. Rita Mae Brown begins with a very personal\u00a0\u00a0account of her own career, from her days as a young\u00a0\u00a0poet who had written a novel no publisher wanted\u00a0\u00a0to take a chance on, right up to her recent\u00a0\u00a0adventures as a Hollywood screenwriter. In a sassy style\u00a0\u00a0that makes her outspoken advice as entertaining as\u00a0\u00a0it is useful, she provides straight talk about\u00a0\u00a0paying the rent while maintaining the energy to\u00a0\u00a0write; and dealing with agents, publishers, critics,\u00a0\u00a0and the publicity circus; about pursuingj\u00a0\u00a0ournalisim, academia, or screen-writing; and about rejecting\u00a0\u00a0the Hemingway myth of the hard-living,\u00a0\u00a0hard-drinking genius. In addition Brown, a former teacher or\u00a0\u00a0writing, offers a serious examination of the\u00a0\u00a0writer's tool--language, plotting, characters,\u00a0\u00a0symbolism--plus exercises to sharpen the ear for dialogue,\u00a0\u00a0and a fascinating, annoted reading list of\u00a0\u00a0important works from the seventh century to the late\u00a0\u00a0twentieth.",
