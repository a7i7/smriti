        "Title": "Low-Fat Grilling: Fabulous Food from the Backyard Barbecue",
        "Authors": "By Barnard, Melanie",
        "Description": "Low-fat cooking and grilling two American passions, are combined in this book of more than one hundred recipes, with tempting results.  The grill is the perfect tool for cooking delicious and easy low-fat meals. Grilling brings out the natural flavors of foods, making the use of heavy sauces and time-consuming preparations unnecessary. In Low-Fat Grilling Melanie Barnard offers grilling recipes, for all occasions, that are tasty and low in fat. Scrumptious appetizers include Tomato and Basil Pizza and Honey Mustard Sweet Potato Thins; entr\u00e9es such as Tandoor-Style Chicken, Grill-Smoked Turkey with Curried Peach Salsa, Salmon with Dilled Cucumber Yogurt Sauce, and Steak and Charred Onion Sandwich; and vegetables like Carrots with Ginger and Honey Glaze, Grilled Corn Chowder, and Plantain Slices. Barnard cleverly includes recipes for pasta, soup, and sandwiches, as well as for other improbable candidates for grilling, like polenta, potato chips, and apples. Side dishes, accompaniments, and desserts that complement grilled foods will also provide satisfaction without the fat: marinades and salsas, coleslaw, baked beans, and strawberry shortcake. In addition to the recipes themselves, Barnard provides suggested menus for entertaining, ideas of getting the most from your grill, helpful nutritional analyses, and general hints on how to cut back on fat without compromising taste. Easy and delicious, Melanie Barnard&#39;s grilled foods belong on the dieter&#39;s table as much as on everyone&#39;s picnic bench.",

        "Description": "To restore men's rightful heritage, Denis Boyles and Gregg Stebben, the coauthors of A Man's Life: The Complete Instructions, have compiled a priceless treasury of forgotten lore and rustic hobbies that our forefathers possessed but that we have lost. Culled from turn-of-the-century publications and old scouting-type manuals, this guide is written in our grandfathers' language, with their sensibility and wisdom. Since the outdoors is one place where almost all good advice is old advice, the focus is on a man's life lived outdoors camping, hunting, and fishing. With these instructions and advice, man can once again learn how to build a fly fishing rod, shoot a rifle with both eyes open, hit a flying target, start a fire without matches, travel light - but right, keep cool when lost, splice a rope, catch a pig, predict the weather from the color of the sky, rescue someone drowning, send a smoke signal, track a bobcat or a moose, build a log cabin, buy and sort fishing hooks, make a canoe, choose the perfect tent, plan a one-day hike, play golf on a five-acre meadow ... and much, much more.With its mix of essential and extraordinary vintage wisdom, The Lost Lore of a Man's Life is a must for every man's back pocket and backpack.",

        "Title": "Taken on Trust",
        "Authors": "By Waite, Terry",
        "Description": "In his prison cell Terry Waite wrote his autobiography in his head. This is it, his own heart-rending account of how he survived for 1,763 days in captivity, almost four years of which were in solitary confinement. He reveals the inner strengths which helped him endure the savage treatment he received from his captors; and how he supported himself by his deeply held faith and his resolve not to have any regrets, any false sentimentality, or self-pity.Above all it was his recollection of times past, of his life from childhood onward, which gave him the will to keep going. He relives in his memory his humble upbringing as the son of the village policeman in Styal, Cheshire, his early career in the Church Army, his years in the dangerous role of advisor to the first African archbishop in Idi Amin's Uganda, his work in Rome as consultant to religious communities and - during his time as the Archbishop of Canterbury's envoy - his gradual emergence on the world stage as one of the most remarkable figures of his generation. A humanitarian in his own right, he became a negotiator over the plight of the hostages in Tehran and Libya - he describes his meetings with Colonel Gaddafi - and finally with the kidnappers of the Beirut hostages. He explains his ever-increasing involvement with others on all sides, including Oliver North and George Bush, until that fateful day in January 1987 when he himself was \"taken on trust\" and became a captive.This deeply moving autobiography, with its Kafkaesque sequence of events and taut narrative, is destined to become one of the classic accounts of man's survival at the limits of human endurance.",

        "Authors": "By Okrent, Daniel and Wulf, Steve",
        "Description": "In the 150 years since its humble birth, baseball has shown an infinite capacity for exhilarating triumphs, heart-breaking losses, amusing blunders, and awe-inspiring feats.  Willie Mays's amazing catch of Vic Wertz's monstrous drive in the 1954 World Series, Bobby Thomson's \"shot heard round the world,\" the \"Black Sox\" Scandal of 1919, DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, even the pitiful 1962 Mets, who finished 60 games (or two full months) out of first place--these are all part of baseball lore and part of its allure.   A banquet for baseball fans, Baseball Anecdotes offers a colorful and highly entertaining anecdotal history of America's National Pastime, from the founding of the first professional baseball team, Cincinnati's Red Stockings, by George Wright (the son of a famous English cricketer) and the forming of the first league (in a New York bar on St. Patrick's Day), to the miraculous comeback of the Mets in the Sixth Game of the 1986 World Series. Here you will meet the game's great innovators (from John Montgomery Ward, who invented the pitching mound--and also pitched the second perfect game in history--to Bill Veeck, who introduced the exploding scoreboard in Comiskey Park); the colorful eccentrics (such as King Kelly, who was accompanied off the field by a black monkey and a Japanese valet) and the self-effacing stars (such as Harmon Killebrew, who, when asked what his hobbies were, said, \"Well, I like to wash dishes\"); the penny-pinching owners (when Babe Ruth requested tickets for the Yankee's 1936 season opener at The House That Ruth Built, the team management said sure, just send in a check); and, most of all, the legendary players: Ruth, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Lefty Gomez, Sandy Koufax, Casey Stengel, Mickey Mantle, and countless others.  Along the way, readers are treated to instant replays of some of baseball's most memorable moments, such as Roger Maris' quest for Ruth's 61-home-run record, Don Larsen's perfect World Series game, and Ted Williams' final major league at bat (he hit a home run).   Okrent and Wulf, two highly regarded baseball writers, touch all the bases in this vividly written volume, capturing the whole human drama of baseball in a cascade of stories that offers a nostalgic feast (or, as Yogi Berra would put it, \"Deja vu all over again\") as well as a fascinating introduction to baseball lore for the newest generation of fans.",

The pictures revealed the Duchess of York enjoying a clandestine affair in St. Tropez with American Johnny Bryan - and the public who had been surprised by Sarah's groundbreaking separation was now stunned by the shocking new evidence of her dissatisfaction with her life as a royal. What behind-the-scenes events could possibly have driven the Duchess to rebel as drastically as she did?Chris Hutchins's and Peter Thompson's years of royal watching - with special attention to the Duchess - have culminated in this explosive account of the events preceding and during Sarah's fall from royal favor.Never before has the energetic, determined Duchess been revealed in such honest detail - from the plain, outdoorsy girl who liked to have a good time, to the bride who bested the odds to marry into a royal circle that promptly shut her out. This mesmerizing book offers not only the first candid view of Sarah herself, but also an astonishing look at what really goes on in the lives of today's young royals.",

You may proceed through the carefully planned sequence of over forty different pairs of reds, whites, roses, and sparkling wines, or follow the directions to the wines of a particular region or a particular class, such as Cabernets.Whichever route you opt for, Mastering Wine can provide you with an acquaintance with the major kinds and classes of dry dinner wines, a painless introduction to wine terms, and practice in the art of tasting and analyzing wine - of any kind. Anyone who would like an introduction to wine or a wider appreciation of the infinite variety of wines will find Mastering Wine the only practical, enjoyable, and affordable choice.",

        "Title": "Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution",
        "Authors": "By Hammer, Michael and Champy, James",
        "Description": "\"America's business problem is that it is entering the twenty-first century with companies designed during the nineteenth century.\" So write Michael Hammer and James Champy in this pioneering book on the most important topic in business circles today: reengineering - the radical redesign of a company's processes, organization, and culture. Reengineering the Corporation offers nothing less than a brand-new vision of how companies should be organized and managed if they are to succeed - indeed even survive - in the 1990s and beyond. Reengineering does not seek to make businesses better through incremental improvements - 10 percent faster here or 20 percent less expensive there. The aim of reengineering is a quantum leap in performance - the 100 percent or even tenfold improvements that can follow from entirely new work processes and structures.Building on their firsthand experiences, Hammer and Champy show how some of the world's premier corporations use the principles of reengineering to save hundreds of millions of dollars a year, to achieve unprecedented levels of customer satisfaction, and to speed up and make more flexible all aspects of their operations. The key to reengineering is abandoning the most basic notions on which the modern organization is founded. Today's workers and managers are prisoners of antiquated theories about organizing work - theories that date back to the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. These ideas - the division of labor, the need for elaborate controls, the managerial hierarchy - no longer work in a world of global competition and unrelenting change. In their stead, the authors introduce the notion of process orientation, of concentrating on and rethinking end-to-end activities that create value for customers.This book is about more than ideas, however. From their work with leading companies around the world, Hammer and Champy have learned how to make reengineering succeed. They lay out the approaches that have enabled such companies as Bell Atlantic, Taco Bell, and Hallmark Cards to reinvent themselves. They offer a vision of the reengineered corporation and a road map for companies to follow in getting there.",

With Battina as the lovely uncomplaining Ella and Fay as the evil stepmother, the story unfolds in true fairy-tale fashion. Cinderella's sooty rags are transformed by a fairy godmother into a glorious ball gown, and mice, lizards, and a rat become line attendants to transport Cinderella to the ball. After a grand entrance - no one, not even her stepsisters, recognizes Cinderella as the beautiful, mysterious latecomer - Cinderella meets her prince, then loses her glass slipper as she rushes to be home by midnight. To the surprise of the evil stepmother and lazy stepsisters, Cinderella is, of course, discovered to be the one true owner of the delicate slipper, and she is reunited with her prince to live happily ever after. With each page of this astonishing book, the timeless tale undergoes its own transformation. William Wegman's unique visual interpretation refreshes and renews its spirit, making Cinderella a classic for our time.",

        "Description": "The father of our country slept with Martha, but schlepped in the District. Now in the great man\u2019s footsteps comes humorist and twenty-year Washington resident Christopher Buckley with the real story of the city\u2019s founding. Well, not really. We\u2019re just trying to get you to buy the book. But we can say with justification that there\u2019s never been a more enjoyable, funny, and informative tour guide to the city than Buckley. His delight as he points out things of interest is con-tagious, and his frequent digressions about his own adventures as a White House staffer are often hilarious.In Washington Schlepped Here, Buckley takes us along for several walks around the town and shares with us a bit of his \u201cother\u201d Washington. They include \u201cDante\u2019s Paradiso\u201d (Union Station); the \u201cZero Milestone of American democracy\u201d (the U.S. Capitol); the \u201cAlmost Pink House\u201d (the White House); and many other historical (and often hysterical) journeys. Buckley is the sort of wonderful guide who pries loose the abalone-like clich\u00e9s that cling to a place as mythic as D.C. Wonderfully insightful and eminently practical, Washington Schlepped Here shows us that even a city whose chief industry is government bureaucracy is a lot funnier and more surprising than its media-ready image might let on.",

This is the first by Bob Knight---one of the most literate, candid, quoted, and outspoken men in American public life telling in this first-person account of his full, rich life. Much of that life has been in basketball, most of it because of basketball, but it also has brought him forward as a coach, who has proved academic responsibility and production of championship college athletic teams not only can coexist but should. His excitement as things start anew for him at Texas Tech is matched here by his characteristic frankness and remarkable recollection of a life he clearly has enjoyed.His Indiana teams also won NCAA titles in 1980--81 and 1986--87. The 1975--76 Indiana team was the last unbeaten team in college men's basketball. Knight's career includes six seasons as head coach at Army, where his teams won 102 games and lost 50. He is the only coach whose teams won championships in the NCAA tournament, the National Invitation Tournament, the Olympic Games, and the Pan American Games. During all that he has been at the heart of more controversies while running a winning and squeaky-clean program than any coach of any sport anytime or anywhere.His excitement as things start anew for him is matched here by his candor and remarkable recollection of a life he clearly has enjoyed. You'll see why, with story after story---some delightful, some hilarious, some poignant, none of them dull: the story of Bob Knight's life.",

But their lives are filled with secrets. Haunted by a past she has kept hidden even from her husband, Marielle secretly lights a candle each year for a child who died in a tragic accident when he was scarcely more than a baby. Consumed with guilt, Marielle is nevertheless a devoted wife and mother. Malcolm, stern and successful, is a man everyone admires.On the eve of little Teddy's disappearance, Marielle runs into her first love, American expatriate Charles Delauney. The ache of memory is instantly revived, their brief moments together bittersweet and explosive. And when Teddy is kidnapped, Charles is first blamed, then arrested. Suspicions and accusations mingle with terror and heartbreak as the Pattersons, the New York police, and the FBI turn the city and eventually the country, upside down, looking for Teddy.The inevitable parallels with the Lindberghs are drawn, and the fear that Teddy has been killed can't be ignored. Every threat, every failure, every terror, is remembered, examined, explored. Even Marielle is scrutinized by the FBI, and special agent John Taylor.The questions are inevitable: Who kidnapped Teddy Patterson? Did Charles Delauney? Someone else? Did Marielle conspire with them? Is the child dead or alive? Does Malcolm, the boy's father, have secrets of his own? John Taylor becomes obsessed with mother and child, and finding the elusive answers.A terrifying court drama seeks to put Charles Delauney behind bars as a series of revelations begins to unravel the truth about Marielle, Charles, and Malcolm. Piece by piece the uncovering of their past creates a complex mosaic of the motives and passions controlling their lives.Vanished is an intriguing tale of guilt, desire, and suspense, and people one can't easily forget, as they are drawn inexorably together, seeking the child that...vanished.",

        "Authors": "By Hellenga, Robert",
        "Description": "Chapter OneWhere I Want to BeI was twenty-nine years old when the Arno flooded its banks on Friday 4 November 1966. According to the Sunday New York Times the damage wasn't extensive, but by Monday it was clear that Florence was a disaster. Twenty feet of water in the cloisters of Santa Croce, the Cimabue crucifix ruined beyond hope of restoration, panels ripped from the Baptistry doors, the basement of the Biblioteca Nazionale completely underwater, hundreds of thousands of volumes waterlogged, the Archivio di Stato in total disarray. On Tuesday I decided to go to Italy, to offer my services as a humble book conservator, to help in any way I could, to save whatever could be saved, including myself.The decision wasn't a popular one at home. Papa was having money troubles of his own and didn't want to pay for a ticket. And my boss at the Newberry Library didn't understand either. He already had his ticket, paid for by the library, and needed me to mind the store. There wasn't any point in both of us going, was there?\"The why don't I go and you can mind the store?\"\"Because, because, because . . .\"\"Yes?\"Because it just didn't make sense. He couldn't see his way clear to granting me a leave of absence, not even a leave of absence without pay. He even suggested that the library might have to replace me, in which case . . .But I decided to go anyway. I had enough money in my savings account for a ticket on Icelandic, and I figured I could live on the cheap once I got there. Besides, I wanted to break the mold in which my life was hardening, and I thought this might be a way to do it. Going to Florence was better than waiting around with nothing coming up.My English teacher at Kenwood High used to say that we're like onions: you can peel off one layer after another and never get to a center, an inner core. You just run out of layers. But I think I'm like a peach or an apricot or a nectarine. There's a pit at the center. I can crack my teeth on it, or I can suck on it like a piece of candy; but it won't crumble, and it won't dissolve. The pit is an image of myself when I was nineteen. I'm in Sardegna, and I'm standing high up on a large rock\u2013a cliff, actually\u2013and I don't have any clothes on, and everyone is looking at me, telling me to come down, not to jump, it's too high.It's my second time in Italy. I spent a year here with Mama when I was fifteen, and then I came back by myself, after finishing high school at home, to do the last year of the liceo with my former classmates. Now we're celebrating the end of our examinations\u2013Silvia (who spent a year with us in Chicago), Claudia, Rossella, Giulio, Fabio, Alessandro. Names like flowers, or bells. And me, Margot Harrington. More friends are coming later. Silvia's parents (my host family) have a summer house just outside Terranova, but we're camping on the beach, five kilometers down the coast. The coast is safe, they say, though there are bandits in the centro. Wow!It's my birthday\u2013August first\u2013and we've had a supper of bluefish and squid that we caught with a net. The squid taste like rubber bands, the heavy kind that I used to chew on in grade school and that boys sometimes used to snap our bottoms with in junior high. Life is sharp and snappy, too, full of promise, like the sting of those rubber bands: I've passed my examinations with distinction; I'm going to Harvard in the fall (well, to Radcliffe); I've got an Italian boyfriend named Fabio Fabbriani; and I've just been skinny-dipping in the stinging cold salt sea.The others have put their clothes on now\u2013I can see them below me, sitting around the remains of the fire in shorts and halter tops and shirts with the sleeves rolled up two turns, talking, glancing up nervously\u2013but I want to savor the taste/thrill of my own nakedness a little longer, unembarrassed in the dwindling light. It's the scariest thing I've ever done, except coming to Italy in the first place.Fabio sits with his back toward me while he smokes a cigarette, pretending to be angry because I won't come down, but when I close my eyes and will him to turn, he puts his cigarette out in the sand and turns. Just at that moment I jump, sucking in my breath for a scream but then holding it, in case I need it latter, which I do. I hit the Tyrrhenian Sea feet first, generating little waves that will, in theory, soon be lapping the beaches along the entire western coast of Italy\u2013Sicily and North Africa, too. The Tyrrhenian Sea responds by closing over me and it's pitch, not like the pool in Chicago where I learned to swim, but deep and dark and dangerous and deadly.The air in my lungs\u2013the scream and I saved for just such an occasion\u2013carries me up to the surface, and I strike out for the cove, meeting Fabio before I'm halfway there, wondering if like me he's naked under the water and not knowing for sure till we're walking waist deep and he takes me by the shoulders and kisses me and I can feel something bobbing against my legs like a floating cork. We haven't made love yet, but it's won't be long now. O dio mio. The waiting is so lovely. He squeezes my buns and I squeeze his, surprised, and then we splash in to the beach and put on our clothes.What I didn't know at the time was that my mother had become seriously ill. Instead of spending the rest of the summer in Sardegna, I had to go back to Chicago, and then, after that, nothing happened. I mean none of the things I'd expected to happen happened. Instead of making love with Fabio Fabbriani on the verge of the Tyrrhenian Sea, I got laid on a vinyl sofa in the back room of the SNCC headquarters on Forty-seventh Street. Instead of going to Harvard, I went to Edgar Lee Masters College, where Mama had taught art history for twenty years. Instead of going to graduate school I spent two years at the Institute for Paper Technology on Green Bay Avenue; instead of becoming a research chemist I apprenticed myself to a book conservator in Hyde Park and then took a position in the conservation department of the Newberry Library. Instead of getting married and having a daughter of my own, I lived at home and looked after Mama, who was dying of lung cancer. A year went by, two years, three years, four. Mama died; Papa lost most of his money. My sister Meg got married and moved away; my sister Molly went to California with her boyfriend and then to Ann Arbor. The sixties were churning around me, and I couldn't seem to get a footing. I tried to plunge in, to get wet, to catch hold, to find a place in one of the boats tossing and turning on the white-water rapids: the sit-ins, the rock concerts, the freedom rides, SNCC, CORE, SDS, the Civil Rights Act, the Great Society. I spent a lot of time holding hands and singing \"We shall overcome,\" I spent a lot of time buying coffee and doughnuts and rolling joints, and I spent some time on my back, too\u2013the only position for a woman in the Movement.I'd had no sleep on the plane; my eyes were blurry so it was hard to read; and besides, the story I was reading was as depressing as the view from the window of the train\u2013flat, gray, poor, dreary, actively ugly rather than passively uninteresting. And I kept thinking about Papa and his money troubles and his lawsuits, and about the embroidered seventeenth-century prayer books on my work table at the Newberry that needed to be disbound, washed, mended, and resewn before Christmas for an exhibit sponsored by the Caxton Club.So I was under a certain amount of pressure. I was looking for a sign, the way some religious people look for signs, something to let them know they're on the right track. Or on the wrong track, in which case they can turn back. I didn't know what I was looking for, but I was trying to pay attention, to notice everything\u2013the faces of the two American women sitting opposite me in the compartment, scribbling furiously in their notebooks; the Neapolitan accent of the Italian conductor; the depressing French farmhouses, gray boxes of stucco or cinder block, I couldn't make out which.That's what I was doing\u2013paying attention\u2013when the train pulled into the station at Metz and I saw the Saint-Cyr cadet on the platform, bright as the Archangel Gabriel bringing the good news to the Virgin Mary.I'd better explain. Papa did all the cooking in our family. He started when Mama went to Italy one summer when I was nine\u2013it was right after the war\u2013to look at the pictures, to see for herself what she'd only seen in the Harvard University Prints series and on old three-by-four-inch tinted slides that she used to project on the dining room wall; and when she came back he kept on doing it. My sisters and I did the dishes and Papa took care of everything else, day in and day out, and whether it was Italian or French or Chinese or Malaysian, it was always wonderful, it was always special. Penne alla puttanesca, an arista tied with sprigs of rosemary, paper-thin strips of beef marinated in hoisin sauce and Szechwan peppercorns, whole fresh salmon poached in white wine and finished with a mustard sauce, chicken thighs simmered in soy sauce and lime juice, curries so fiery that at their first bite unwary guests would clutch their throats and cry out for water, which didn't help a bit. Those were our favorites, the standards against which we measured other dishes; but our very favorite treat of all was the dessert Papa made on our birthdays, instead of cake, which was supposed to look like the hats worn by cadets at Saint-Cyr, the French military academy. We'd never been to Saint-Cyr, of course, but we would have recognized a cadet anywhere in the world, if he'd been wearing his hat.That's why I was so startled when I looked out the window of the Luxembourg-Venise Express and saw my cadet standing there on the platform\u2013the young man Papa had teased me about, the Prince Charming who had never materialized. He was holding a suitcase in one hand and shifting his weight back and forth from one foot to the other, as if he had to go to the bathroom, and his parents were talking at him so intensely that I thought for a minute he was going to miss the train. And his hat! I couldn't believe it was a real hat and not a frozen mousse of chocolate and egg whites and whipped cream with squiggly Italian meringues running up and down the sides for braids. That hat stirred something inside me, made me feel I was doing the right thing and that I ought to keep going, that things would work out. Just to make sure I closed my eyes and willed him into the compartment, just as I had once willed Fabio Fabbriani to turn and watch me plunge feet first into the sea. As I was willing him into the compartment I was willing the American women out of it\u2013not making my cadet's appearance contingent on their departure, however, because I was pretty sure they weren't going to budge. I kept my face down in my book and waited, eyes closed lightly, listening to the noises in the corridor.I was, I suppose, still operating, at least subconsciously, on a fairy-tale model of reality: I was Sleeping Beauty, or Snow White, waiting for some prince whose romantic kisses would awaken my full feelings, liberate my story senses, emancipate my drowsy and constrained imagination, take me back to that last Italian summer.The train was already in motion when the door of the compartment finally opened. I kept my eyes closed another two seconds and then looked up at\u2013not my Prince Charming but the Neapolitan conductor, an old man so frail I'd had to help him hoist the American women's mammoth suitcases onto the overhead luggage rack. These suitcases were to luggage what Burberrys are to rainwear\u2013lots of extra pockets and straps and mysterious zippers concealed under flaps.I asked him about the Saint-Cyr cadet.\"The next compartment,\" he said. \"Not your type. Too young. You need an older man like me.\"\"You're already married.\"He shrugged, putting his whole body into it, arms, hands, shoulders, head cocked, stomach pulled in.\"Better tell your friends\"\u2013we were speaking in Italian\u2013\"that the dining car will be taken off the train before we cross the border. You need to reserve a seat early.\"I nodded.\"Unless,\" he went on, \"they have those valises stuffed with American food. Porcamattina.\" He glanced upward at the suitcases, tapped his cheekbone with an index finger and was gone.I felt for these American women some of the mixed feelings that the traveler feels for the tourist. On the one hand you want to help, to show off your knowledge; on the other you don't want to get involved. I didn't want to get involved. They weren't my type. These were saltwater women\u2013sailors, golfers, tennis players, clubwomen with suntans in November, large limbed, confident, conspicuous, firm, trim, sleek as walruses in their worsted wool suits. They reminded me of the Gold Coast women who used to show up around the edges of CORE demonstrations, with their checkbooks open, telling us how much they admired what we were doing, and how they wished they could help more. All fucked up ideologically, according to our leaders at SNCC: \"They think their shit don't stink.\"As far as they knew, I was a scruffy little Italian\u2013I hadn't spoken a word of English in their presence, and I was reading an Italian novel\u2013and it was too late to undeceive them. I had heard too much.I knew, for example, that they'd met the previous summer at some kind of writing workshop at Johns Hopkins University and that they'd both jumped into the sack with their instructor, a novelist named Philip. I knew that Philip was bald but well hung (\"like a shillelagh\"). I knew that neither of them had done it dog fashion BP (\"before Philip\") and that they were traveling second class because Philip had told them they'd get more material that way for the stories they were going to write now that they were divorced.Part of their agenda, I gathered, was to notice things, to pay attention. Maybe they were looking for signs, too, maybe not; in either case they seemed to be trying to impress the details of European railroad travel onto the pages of their marbled composition books by sheer physical force. Nothing escaped their notice, not even the signs, in French, German and Italian, warning passengers not to throw things out the window and not to pull the cord on the signal d'alarme. All the details went into their notebooks\u2013the fine of not less than 5,000 FF, the prison term of not less than one year. And when one noticed something, the other did, too: the instructions on the window latch, the way the armrests worked, the captions on the faded views of Chartres Cathedral that hung on the walls of the compartment above the backs of the seats. (I was tempted to look at them myself, but I didn't want to give myself away or interrupt their game.)I kept my nose in my book\u2013Natalia Ginzburg's Lessico famigliare. It was a strenuous hour, and I was glad when, simultaneously, panting like dogs after a good run, they closed their notebooks and resumed their conversation.",

It is a book about winning, leadership, mastery, change, and personal growth, based on understanding and controlling the shifting dynamics of a team - any team, whether it is a small company or a giant corporation, a family, a city, or a group of athletes.How does a struggling team form a covenant to work together instead of separately? How does a successful team battle complacency? How does any team overcome the thunderbolts that strike out of the blue?Drawing upon the great teachers and his own experiences in and out of sports, interweaving them with dozens of parallels and stories from business and society, Riley shows how to ride the cycles of team change, balance role players and stars, build solid foundations, break through self-imposed barriers, create change within continuity, and nurture cooperation within competition.\"All of my contacts and experiences have proved to me, over and over again, that the complex inner rhythms of teamwork - flows of ambition, power, cooperation, and emotion - are the keys to making dreams come true,\" says Riley, and in The Winner Within, he provides the tools, insights, and plan of action to help master those rhythms. It is a book of universal power and scope - a new classic of the literature.",

        "Description": "Whether he was good, bad, drunk, heroic, or just plain absent, chances are your father has left his stamp upon you. In this warmhearted, sometimes droll, often poignant collection, a host of men and women reminisce about their fathers - from wrathful patriarchs to incorrigible eccentrics to doting dads.Aissa Wayne offers a heartfelt account of John Wayne's final, heroic appearance at the Oscars. Arthur Ashe remembers his father's personal triumph over the injustices of racism. Sean Lennon wistfully recalls the brief five years of his life before John Lennon's murder when \"my dad and I were buddies, and there was no real sorrow.\" Candice Bergen tells about sitting on her father's knee next to Charlie McCarthy while the famous ventriloquist merrily squeezed their necks and spoke for both of them. And in the magnificent comic essay that opens the volume, Wilfrid Sheed fondly describes his unconventional father as \"a total irredeemable indoorsman.\" Here too are cameos of fictional fathers, with moving excerpts from Mona Simpson's The Lost Father and Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day, to name only two.As the chapter \"Daddy Dearest\" reveals, life with father cannot always be likened to one long idyllic game of catch in the park. Pat Conroy dreaded his father's temper. Antoinette Giancana was sternly admonished by her Mafioso father that she should \"never, never open the door to a stranger.\" And Laurence Olivier once wryly remarked that the only trouble between him and his father \"was that he couldn't see the slightest purpose in my existence.\" But more often these remembrances are affectionate and nostalgic. Perhaps it is true, as Nietschze tells us, that if you have not had a good father, it is necessary to invent one. This marvelously varied book celebrates fathers of all stripes, and offers moving testimony to the ways in which a father's legacy endures.",

Is he Charlie Hustle, the all-American kid who never grew up, who pushed and stretched himself to get the most out of his limited talent, who would do anything in his power to win and to be a part of the game he loved? Or is he the bloated ex-athlete who broke baseball's one absolute taboo, and who was willing to drag down the whole structure of the sport to save himself?In January 2004, Pete Rose publicly admitted to betting on baseball and began his controversial campaign to get himself off the ineligible list and into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
