        "Authors": "By Mountain Dreamer, Oriah",
        "Description": "A beautiful presentation of Oriah's signature prose poem, preceded by a chapter relating the full life story behind the poem and then followed by a chapter on the life of the poem and its remarkable effect on people's lives, including her own.   The prose poem The Invitation was originally passed from reader to reader over the internet and hand\u2013to\u2013hand; it was these readers who helped make the book a best\u2013seller.  This small, beautifully presented book, incorporating the poem and two short additional new chapters by Oriah, gives old and new readers the beloved poem in a fresh way, as a gift for others or oneself. The often moving and sometimes funny chapters give a fresh, full account of how the poem came to be, and then discuss the life of the poem after it was written and circulated to so many readers, via the internet, photocopies, and eventually the full book The Invitation. Artwork will accompany each paragraph of the poem.",

        "Title": "Unfit For Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry",
        "Authors": "By Corsi, Jerome R., Ph.D. and O'Neill, John E.",
        "Description": "\"What sort of combination of hypocrite and paradox is John Kerry?\" ask the authors in this heated critique of the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s Vietnam&#150;era military service and antiwar activism. O\u2019Neill, a lawyer and swift boat veteran, and Corsi, an expert on Vietnam antiwar movements, argue that Kerry misrepresented his wartime exploits and is therefore incompetent to serve as commander in chief. Buttressed by interviews with Navy veterans who patrolled Vietnam\u2019s waters, some along with Kerry, the book claims he exaggerated minor injuries, self-inflicted others, wrote fictitious diary entries and filed \"phony\" reports of his heroism under fire&#151;all in a calculated quest to secure career-enhancing combat medals. They also maintain that Kerry, whom they call a \"moral coward,\" committed atrocities that alarmed his peers and superior officers during his four-month tour of duty. Yet his activities on behalf of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War clearly raises the authors\u2019 hackles the most, and they present Kerry\u2019s post-war actions as additional, damning evidence of his \"total unfitness,\" claiming that his testimony against the war \"caused more deaths and prolonged the war in Vietnam by undermining support at home and contributing directly to a Vietnamese Communist victory.\" The battle that lies at the heart of this book is the decades-old feud between antiwar veterans and their my-country-right-or-wrong counterparts. The authors\u2019 conservative take on the war is palpable: the U.S. military failed to unleash \"massive, indiscriminate bombing\" to force North Vietnam\u2019s capitulation; the conflict was a struggle against communism, not a civil war; and the dissenting soldiers undermined homefront morale. Consequently, this overwrought and repetitive polemic seethes with a resentment that compromises the otherwise eyebrow-raising testimonies. Further, without access to Kerry\u2019s full military and medical records, the authors rely heavily on 35-year-old recollections and recent Kerry biographies by Douglas Brinkley and a Boston Globe reporting team. Those looking for a thorough, unbiased investigation into Kerry\u2019s wartime record would do best to wait for more objective, methodical chroniclers who have access to the relevant documents.",

For the past 13 years, he has been banned from baseball and barred from his rightful place in the Hall of Fame-- accused of violating MLB's one taboo. Rule 21 states that no one associated with baseball shall ever gamble on the game. The punishment is no less than a permanent barring from baseball and exclusion from the Hall of Fame.Pete Rose has lived in the shadow of his exile. He has denied betting on the game that he loves. He has been shunned by MLB, investigated by the IRS, and served time for tax charges in the U.S. Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois.But he's coming back.Pete Rose has never been forgotten by the fans who loved him throughout his 24-year career. The men he played with have stood by him. In this, his first book since his very public fall from grace, Pete Rose speaks with great candor about all the outstanding questions that have kept him firmly in the public eye. He discloses what life was like behind bars, discusses the turbulent years of his exile, and gives a vivid picture of his early life and baseball career. He also confronts his demons, tackling the ugly truths about his gambling and his behavior.MY PRISON WITHOUT BARS is Pete Rose's full accounting of his life. No one thinks he's perfect. He has made mistakes-- big ones. And he is finally ready to admit them.",

Never mind that she's never handled anything like this before. Having won nearly every civil and criminal case she's ever tried, the brilliant and unconventional Bennie has the guts, and she'll do what it takes to succeed. Even if that means wearing pantyhose and putting herself on a curse diet.Then her wallet goes missing. And Bennie's life goes crazy.It's not just that one of her associates has dyed her hair pink. Or that another's old-world Italian mother gives Bennie the evil eye. But someone posing as the outspoken, blue-eyed, blond attorney is wreaking havoc around town, apparently determined to destroy everything Bennie loves. Only one person can pull off this double deception -- Bennie's identical twin sister, Alice Connelly. But as far as Bennie knows, Alice left Philly long ago and never looked back.When events escalate into murder, the maverick lawyer realizes that the stakes are far greater than she feared. But Bennie Rosato refuses to be anyone's victim. To find the killer, she'll plunge head-first into a life-and-death investigation that will bring her face-to-face with evil darker yet more familiar than anything before.A riveting legal thriller set against the backdrop of a richly emotional family story, Dead Ringer is this author's most intriguing novel yet. According to USA Today, \"Scottoline's writing style is sharp, intelligent, funny, and hip. She gives fans of legal thrillers a good, twisty plot, lively characters, and an all-around fun read.\" With this book, Scottoline delivers a tour de force that is not to be missed.",

The authorities have reason to believe that he was not killed by the enemy, or by friendly fire; they suspect he was murdered.At first, Paul Brenner, himself a Vietnam vet, isn't interested in investigating the case. After his forced retirement from the army's Criminal Investigation Division, he has adapted to the life of a civilian with a comfortable pension. Then his old boss, Karl Hellmann, summons him to the Vietnam Memorial to call in a career's worth of favors.Hellmann tells Brenner of the circumstances surrounding the officer's death, and gives him this much to go on: The incident happened over three decades ago in Vietnam; the only evidence is a recently discovered letter written by an enemy soldier describing an act of shocking violence. The name of the North Vietnamese soldier is known, but not his present whereabouts, or even if he is alive or dead.Brenner's assignment: Return to Vietnam and find the witness. The addendum: The mission is very important ot the U.S. Army. Brenner's the ideal man for the job. And it's in his best interest that he doesn't know what this case is really about.Reluctantly, Brenner begins a strange journey that unearths his own painful memories of Vietnam and leads him down a trail as dangerous as the ones he walked a lifetime ago as a young infantryman. From sultry, sinful Saigon, where he meets beautiful American expatriate Susan Weber, to the remote, forbidding wilderness of up-country Vietnam, he will follow a trail of lies, betrayal, and murder ... and uncover an explosive, long-buried secret.",

        "Description": "It is often pointed out that \"for every bad borrower, and for every failed project, there is also a culpable lender or investor.\" This observation is particularly apt for the debate now raging in the capital markets: should private bankers and investment managers bear a greater share of the costs when financial crises erupt in emerging economies? Critics who have analyzed the \"plumbing\" of the world's financial architecture have thus far devoted enormous attention to the demand side\u2014structural weaknesses in emerging markets. They have excoriated the IMF for ineptitude and policy mistakes. But the authors of this study argue that financial leaders of the G-10 nations (industrial nations that were hardly affected by the crises of 1997-98) owe a responsibility\u2014both to their own citizens and the emerging markets\u2014to take a far more vigilant stance.Dobson and Hufbauer criticize the supply side of world capital markets and ask how G-10 capital suppliers can reform their own financial systems to make the world safe for large-scale international capital flows. They draw a comprehensive picture of international finance through an extensive review of capital flows, the major financial players behind these flows, and the balance between costs and benefits of international capital movements. The authors analyze the implications of changing the rules of the game and recommend specific policy measures.",

Now, with a surprising twist, he gives us his most audacious work yet.  In the final pages of Valhalla Rising, Dirk Pitt discovered, to his shock, that he had two grown children he had never known-twenty-three-year-old fraternal twins born to a woman he thought had died in an underwater earthquake. Both have inherited his love of the sea: the girl, Summer, is a marine biologist; the boy, himself named Dirk, is a marine engineer. And now they are about to help their father in the adventure of a lifetime.  There is a brown tide infesting the ocean off the shore of Nicaragua. The twins are working in a NUMA(r) underwater enclosure, trying to determine its origin, when two startling things happen: Summer discovers an artifact, something strange and beautiful and ancient; and the worst storm in years boils up out of the sky, heading straight not only for them but also for a luxurious floating resort hotel square in its path.  The peril for everybody concerned is incalculable, and, desperately, Pitt, Al Giordino, and the rest of the NUMA(r) crew rush to the rescue, but what they find in the storm's wake makes the furies of nature pale in comparison. For there is an all-too-human evil at work in that part of the world, and the brown tide is only a by-product of its plan. Soon, its work will be complete-and the world will be a very different place.  Though if Summer's discovery is to be believed, the world is already a very different place...  Filled with breathtaking action and suspense, Trojan Odyssey is Cussler at the height of his storytelling powers.",

The boy's father, professing to want the best for his son, breaks up their romance. The years roll forward. Long after the two teenage lovers last saw each other, they are reunited. They are still in love, but for them to marry would still cause great family discord. Will history repeat itself?Thus begins We Had a Dream, Howard Kohn's intricate morality tale about America one generation after the modern era of civil rights activism. Kohn brings us a true story that unfolds against a backdrop of racial politics, suburban culture, and fired-up emotions.

        "Description": "The Richardella-dulcisica, better known as the taste berry, is a unique fruit. When eaten, it causes the taste buds to experience all food eaten afterwards-even distasteful food-as sweet and delicious. Likewise, there are people who, through their love and compassion, make the lives of others better. Like the taste berry, these people can turn sour days into delightful, even joyful, ones. With all the confusion, turmoil and heartache that teens experience, they need \"taste berries\" more than any other group. The authors - a mother/daughter team sensitive to the special needs of teens- have collected a wide array of inspirational material, which they interweave with teens' comments and critiques. The book is divided into units on self-worth, self-respect and self-esteem; friendship; love and meaningful relationships; finding meaning, purpose and direction in life; giving, sharing and making a difference; encouragement and success; and coping with pressure, stress and tough issues. Real teens reviewed this book and the authors completed it with the collaborative feedback of those teens. This innovative approach enables Taste Berries for Teens to show teens - by means of the responses and reactions of their peers, rather than the rhetoric of adults - what it means to be a \"taste berry\" and to appreciate the \"taste berries\" in their lives. In addition, the authors offer their own suggestions and counsel to provide structure for the teen responses. Taste Berries for Teens--a unique combination of timeless and heartwarming narratives, teen responses and reactions, and the authors' own loving and wise commentary and advice--is sure to become every teen reader's constant guide and trusted companion.",

His scientific work has earned him international honors, including election to the Royal Astronomical Society. Yet Benford is also an awardwinning novelist, remarkable for communicating cutting-edge science with crystal clarity in stories that probe the human heart as well as the farthest reaches of space and time. Now Benford brings us a near future in which humanity's vaunted intellect and technology, its courage and imagination, will be put to the ultimate test against a godlike being billions of years old.Dr. Benjamin Knowlton heads the High Energy Astrophysics (enter, a prestigious research facility devoted to the interpretation of astronomical data. He stands at the apex of his profession, respected by his peers and involved in research with the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. But Benjamin has no cause to celebrate. His beloved wife and colleague, Charming, an ex-astronaut turned astronomer, is dying of cancer. She has only a few months to live.Then an anomalous signal from a remote probe alerts Benjamin to the presence of a wandering black hole beyond the orbit of Pluto. Though its trajectory will take it through the solar system, the singularity poses no threat to Earth-on the contrary, it may hold answers to the most fundamental questions of physics. But when an encoded message is received from the block hole, excitement turns to astonishment and apprehension. The thing is alive, intelligent, its mind residing in powerfully fluctuating fields of electromagnetic energies that radiate outward from its infinitely dense core. And it wants a (loser look at Earth...and its inhabitants.The entity -- dubbed the Eater for its habit of devouring everything in its path--proves eager to share its vast knowledge, accumulated in the course of explorations that began long before life arose on Earth.  In exchange, it seeks to learn about human art, culture, and science.  The world is charmed by the seemingly beneficent alien.  Even Channing is infused with fresh strength and purpose.But gradually a terrifying truth about the singularity emerges -- a truth almost too awful to comprehend.  Now, as the world waits, Channing volunteers to undertake a desperate gamble: a one-to-one confrontation with the Eater.Astrophysicist Benjamin Knowlton heads up a large research center while caring for his terminally ill ex-astronaut wife, Channing.  He and his team discover a black hole moving quickly through space, devouring everything in its path, and name it, the \"Eater.\"  There's no danger -- its orbit will miss Earth with room to spare.  Then the Eater speaks.  It is a life form, an intelligence built into an astrophysical field.  It seems benign enough: interested in human art, culture, and intelligence, and eager to share its vast knowledge of many previously unknown alien cultures.  But gradually, humans discover the terrifying truth: the Eater is lonely for companionship on its interstellar journeys, and plans to \"upload\" the personalities of Earth -- by destroying the planet and their physical beings.  Channing volunteers to sacrifice the little time she has left for a magnetic immortality, to become part of the creature and, perhaps, defeat it.Astrophysicist Benjamin Knowlton heads up a large research center while caring for his terminally ill ex-astronaut wife, Channing.

        "Description": "On the surface, Christa Worthington's life had the appearance of privilege and comfort. She was a descendant of prominent New Yorkers. Her sparkling journalism earned the fashion world's respect. But she had turned her back on a glamorous career and begun living in the remote Cape Cod town where she had summered as a child. When she was found murdered in Truro, Massachusetts, just after New Year's Day in 2002, her toddler daughter clinging to her side, her violent death brought to the surface the many unspoken mysteries of her life.Invisible Eden is the deeply felt story of a career woman's attempt to start over and reinvent her life away from the fashion circles of New York and Paris, only to have an out-of-wedlock child with a local fisherman, forge a life as a single mother, and meet a violent end. Portraying Christa's hunger for belonging and her struggle for survival as a first-time mother, Maria Flook searingly evokes her search for a safe haven, her many tumultuous relationships, and the evidence linking family, strangers, lovers, suspects, and innocents to the tragedy that both shocked a seaside town on Cape Cod and horrified the nation. Flook intricately maps Christa's charged life before her death and follows the first year of the murder investigation with the help of the district attorney who is in an election battle even as he searches for the killer. At the same time, Invisible Eden captures the Cape's haunted landscape, class stratifications, and never-ending battles between its wealthy summer residents and its hard-scrabble working families who together form a backdrop for a powerful chronicle of love and murder. An edgy and compelling portrait of a woman's tragic journey, Invisible Eden is a mesmerizing real-life mystery.",

Kate is known for many things within the ivy-covered walls of her esteemed university, but inside or out, the brilliant feminist professor is as renowned for her talent at crime solving as she is for her literary enthusiasms.When Kate Fansler and her husband, Reed, decide to teach a semester at Schuyler Law School, they meet an extraordinary secretary who calls herself Harriet and patterns her life after John le Carre's character George Smiley. Harriet reveals to Kate that this very proper institution of legal learning has some serious skeletons swinging in its perfectly appointed closets.Kate wanted this semester to be a quiet one, but she can't resist getting involved, especially when Harriet tantalizes her with some disturbing information about Schuyler's only tenured female professor. Then there's the faculty wife who has killed her husband. And if Kate doesn't have enough to tackle, she is also up against the men who comprise the faculty of Schuyler itself - a thoroughly unapologetic bastion of white male power, mediocrity, and misogyny.Although she has only a few months on campus, Kate refuses to let Schuyler's rigid ideals and insistence on secrecy suppress her indefatigable curiosity - or her obsession with the truth...",

        "Authors": "By Greif, Geoffrey L. and Hegar, Rebecca L.",
        "Description": "It is estimated that 350,000 children a year are abducted by a family member. What happens when a child is kidnapped from home? What are the emotional and psychological consequences for the child who must live in hiding for weeks, months, or even years? How does the parent left behind cope with having no knowledge of the child's whereabouts or well-being? And what could lead a parent to inflict such a painful existence on his or her own child? Until now, little systematic research has been undertaken to find answers, and the scope and consequences of parental abduction have remained largely unknown.Now, in When Parents Kidnap, Geoffrey Greif and Rebecca Hegar provide the most comprehensive look yet at the problem of the abduction of children by their parents. The authors capture the experiences both of the parents searching for their children and the abductors who have taken them. We see vivid depictions of life on the run and learn the painful details of how children who have been in hiding for months and sometimes years cope with moving from town to town and school to school. We also learn how reunion with the searching parent affects them.The phenomenon of parental abduction is part of a larger social context of changes in the family. Almost a quarter of U.S. children live with only one parent - more than five million of them children of divorce - and the growing prevalence of parental abductions has officials and professionals alarmed. Greif and Hegar point the way to improvements in public policy by showing precisely how changes in custody, divorce, and other laws could help to reduce abduction of children, or resolve it more quickly.Identifying five common scenarios that end in abduction, Greif and Hegar help the reader to understand a wide range of abduction situations, and they provide specific suggestions for mental health professionals involved with families who have experienced this trauma.",

        "Title": "Jolie Blon's Bounce: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Burke, James Lee",
        "Description": "James Lee Burke, acclaimed by critics as \"America's best novelist,\" \"the Graham Greene of the bayou,\" and \"a poet of the mystery novel,\" returns with his popular character, Dave Robicheaux, in a novel rich with atmosphere, ripe with menace, and filled with the kind of crackling dialogue that has made Burke a consistent New York Times best-selling author.  When a beautiful teenage girl is killed, the victim of a particularly savage rape, New Iberia, Louisiana, police detective Dave Robicheaux senses from the very start of the investigation that the most likely suspect, Tee Bobby Hulin, is not the actual killer. Though a drug addict and general ne'er-do-well, Hulin just doesn't fit the profile for this kind of brutal crime. But when another murder occurs -- this victim a drugged-out prostitute who happens to be the daughter of one of the local mafia bigwigs -- all clues once again point to Tee Bobby Hulin, and the cries for arrest become too loud to ignore. The dead girl's father, however, prefers to take matters in his own hands and sets out to find -- and punish -- the killer himself.  But before Robicheaux can solve these crimes and bring the killer or killers to justice, he is forced to battle his own inner demons, including a painkiller addiction, a habit that begins as the result of a brutal and humiliating beating he suffers at the hands of the mysterious and diabolical character known as Legion. A fixture in the area for years, Legion was once the overseer on a local sugarcane plantation and now gets by doing odd jobs. In temperament, however, he's still the malicious and malevolent bully he always was, a man defined by evil and seemingly possessed with supernatural skills of survival.  Added to the mix, and on the good guy side of the balance sheet, is Clete Purcel, a longtime buddy of Robicheaux's and a confirmed boozer and womanizer. Clete comes to New Iberia for a visit and is quickly drawn into the struggle between the various forces of evil in the town, including Jimmy Dean Styles, a black man intent on maintaining his empire of corruption; Joe Zeroski, a trailer park mafioso with palatial aspirations -- and of course, Legion Guidry, the devil incarnate, in whom Robicheaux finds himself facing a challenge and an enemy unlike any he has ever known. And soon, what began as a duel of wits has turned into a dance of death. Gothic, dense, brutal, touching, and always compelling, Jolie Blon's Bounce is classic storytelling from a writer who has been dubbed \"the",

        "Description": "At the heart of this panoramic, multidimensional narrative is the compelling struggle of a young woman to lift her body and soul out of the gutter. Faber leads us back to 1870s London, where Sugar, a nineteen-year-old whore in the brothel of the terrifying Mrs. Castaway, yearns for escape to a better life. Her ascent through the strata of Victorian society offers us intimacy with a host of lovable, maddening, unforgettable characters. They begin with William Rackham, an egotistical perfume magnate whose ambition is fueled by his lust for Sugar, and whose patronage brings her into proximity to his extended family and milieu: his unhinged, childlike wife, Agnes, who manages to overcome her chronic hysteria to make her appearances during \u201cthe Season\u201d; his mysteriously hidden-away daughter, Sophie, left to the care of minions; his pious brother, Henry, foiled in his devotional calling by a persistently less-than-chaste love for the Widow Fox, whose efforts on behalf of The Rescue Society lead Henry into ever-more disturbing confrontations with flesh; all this overseen by assorted preening socialites, drunken journalists, untrustworthy servants, vile guttersnipes, and whores of all stripes and persuasions.Twenty years in its conception, research, and writing, The Crimson Petal and the White is teeming with life, rich in texture and incident, with characters breathtakingly real. In a class by itself, it's a big, juicy, must-read of a novel that will delight, enthrall, provoke, and entertain young and old, male and female.",

        "Title": "The Betrayed Profession: Lawyering at the End of the Twentieth Century.",
        "Authors": "By Mayer, Martin and Linowitz, Sol M.",
        "Description": "Attacks on lawyers have been common in recent years - pundits and politicians from Rush Limbaugh to Dan Quayle have all had their say about lawyers, and virtually all the critics have stressed the same supposed vices of the profession that have been cause for complaint since Shakespeare's day and even earlier. But The Betrayed Profession, by Sol M. Linowitz, senior partner of Coudert Brothers and former general counsel and chairman of the board of Xerox, written with Martin Mayer, bestselling author of the classic The Lawyers, is a dissection of the faltering ethics of today's lawyers that comes from within the profession's own top ranks, and one that strikes at the heart of what has gone wrong with lawyers and lawyering within the past fifty years. It is the first searching examination of the decline of the legal profession to be written by one of the nation's leading lawyers, and in it Sol Linowitz offers guidelines to a renewed professionalism among attorneys.The Betrayed Profession criticizes not the mouthpieces and ambulance chasers who are the usual targets, but the leaders of the bar - the great New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., firms that have created a \"legal services industry\" and turned a public calling into an increasingly unprincipled business.Linowitz shows that most lawyers have lost their connection to the tradition that their is a public profession - that the lawyer's responsibility is not simply to the client, or to the highest fee obtainable, but to the court. Today, the bar association has become a trade union for lawyers, and the public is the loser.The Betrayed Profession offers specific recommendations to restore the practice of law to the respected position it once occupied in American life. Law schools must improve their teaching of ethics. To redress the inequity of the limited legal services available to the poor, Linowitz proposes requiring lawyers to devote at least a week a year to pro bono work or pay a dedicated tax on their fee income. He urges, as well, the construction of a formal code of ethics based both on the specifics of the specialty a lawyer practices and the obligations of citizenship. The Betrayed Profession is an urgent call to action that neither the legal profession nor the public it is meant to serve can afford to ignore.",

        "Description": "From his earliest memories in the desperate slums of Oldcity, Cat has hated the pretensions of the rich, the machinations of the powerful interstellar combines; for at every turn Cat has been used. He's been a thief, a hustler, a spy, a slave. Used as a pawn. As bait.But at this moment, Cat is a scholar, a university team xenologist doing field research on the planet Refuge, home of the enigmatic cloud-whales. Vast aerial creatures created by an unknown species, the telepathic whales are far more than uniquely beautiful. Their thoughts and dreams manifest, falling from the sky to form vast reefs of solid data comprised of pure, retrievable thought... data mined by the planet's all-powerful corporate owner, Tau Biotech.Refuge is also the home of the psionic Hydrans, Cat's lost alien half. Refuge had been theirs, like much of the galaxy, long before the ascendance of the human federation. Now they live like refugees amid the ruins of their past.For the first time in his troubled life, Citizen Cat has the chance to study, reflect, seek his roots.Until he hears a woman's scream...Suddenly, Cat plunges through the false serenity of Refuge society into a nightmare of brutality, bigotry, conspiracy, and corruption, where kidnapping and terrorism are stepping-stones to revolution - or genocide.Beneath the velvet glove of Tau Biotech's corporate state is the iron fist of a government willing to kill to protect its profits. For Tau can only profit by plundering dreams. The broken dreams of Hydrans, whales, and humans... the stolen dreams of the world.",
