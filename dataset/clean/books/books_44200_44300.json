Now that the Cape Light election is over, Mayor Emily Warwick can finally focus on her burgeoning relationship with Sara-the daughter she gave up for adoption twenty years ago. Seeing her after all these years has stirred up some conflicting feelings for Emily.  While she is grateful to have Sara back in her life, she can't help but regret their years apart. Typically she would turn to Reverend Ben for guidance, but turmoil within his own family has inspired a crisis of faith for the minister, making him question whether he is qualified to counsel his congregants. And then there's the fact that Emily is slowly falling for newspaper publisher Dan Forbes, who'd been all set to leave for an extended sailing trip until an accident dashed his plans-giving him and Emily more time to develop their bond.  But with two grown children of his own, would Dan ever want to start another family? Emily hopes so-because she's hoping for a second chance at life...",

Neither eldest son   Philip, headstrong daughter Priscilla, nor rebellious   young Jared seems to care for each other let alone   their father's faith in God. And Constance, Benjamin's   widow, is so overcome with loneliness that she can do   little to restore harmony. It appears that Drew's dream   of a strong Christian heritage, passing without fail from   one generation of Morgans to the next, is in   jeopardy.    When Daniel Cole, an unethical merchant, forces each   of the three children as well as their mother to points of   crisis and decision, God's Spirit sweeps through the   colonies in a dramatic revival. At last, Philip and his   siblings see the error of their divisiveness. But can their   newfound faith and unity withstand the unscrupulous   Cole, who has manipulated Constance into marriage   and who will stop at nothing to destroy a now-thriving   Morgan family business?    From the cobbled streets of Boston to a Narragansett   Indian village to the Atlantic's high seas, follow life in   colonial New England through the adventures of one of   America's first families of faith.",

In The Jaguar Smile, Rushdie paints a brilliantly sharp and haunting portrait of the people, the politics, the terrain, and the poetry of \u201ca country in which the ancient, opposing forces of creation and destruction were in violent collision.\u201d Recounting his travels there in 1986, in the midst of America\u2019s behind-the-scenes war against the Sandinistas, Rushdie reveals a nation resounding to the clashes between government and individuals, history and morality.",

His job is an all-consuming, round-the-clock obsession, propelling him through the underside of Chicago in search of homeless youths. As the founder of an organization called Father Found, Zale is fiercely devoted to a single mission in life: to track down deadbeat dads and hold them accountable to the children they've walked out on.  Though Zale's heart is in the right place, something is very wrong. The more his determination builds, the more he spirals out of control, ruining his most valued relationships, destroying his health, and jeopardizing his life. Now on the brink of undermining the very organization for which he's sacrificed everything, Zale is forced to take a step back and consider his behavior. But just as he finally begins to face the dark, long-repressed secrets motivating him, he is blindsided by a shocking revelation that challenges everything he holds true -- one that will change his life forever.  With the same passion and insight he brought to The Harris Men, RM Johnson weaves a stirring and deeply engaging novel of family and self-sacrifice. A testament to the power of forgiveness and trust, Father Found is an illuminating look at a pressing social emergency and a rare window into the contemporary male psyche.",

Orhan Pamuk was born in Istanbul and still lives in the family apartment  building where his mother first held him in her arms. His portrait of his city is thus also a self-portrait, refracted by memory and the melancholy\u2013or h\u00fcz\u00fcn\u2013  that all Istanbullus share: the sadness that comes of living amid the ruins of a lost empire.With cinematic fluidity, Pamuk moves from his glamorous, unhappy parents to the gorgeous, decrepit mansions overlooking the Bosphorus; from the dawning of his self-consciousness to the writers and painters\u2013both Turkish and foreign\u2013who would shape his consciousness of his city. Like Joyce\u2019s Dublin and Borges\u2019 Buenos Aires, Pamuk\u2019s Istanbul is a triumphant encounter of place and sensibility, beautifully written and immensely moving.",

        "Description": "Anne Fadiman is--by her own admission--the sort of person who learned about sex from her father's copy of Fanny Hill, whose husband buys her 19 pounds of dusty books for her birthday, and who once found herself poring over her roommate's 1974 Toyota Corolla manual because it was the only written material in the apartment that she had not read at least twice. This witty collection of essays recounts a lifelong love affair with books and language. For Fadiman, as for many passionate readers, the books she loves have become chapters in her own life story. Writing with remarkable grace, she revives the tradition of the well-crafted personal essay, moving easily from anecdotes about Coleridge and Orwell to tales of her own pathologically literary family. As someone who played at blocks with her father's 22-volume set of Trollope (\"My Ancestral Castles\") and who only really considered herself married when she and her husband had merged collections (\"Marrying Libraries\"), she is exquisitely well equipped to expand upon the art of inscriptions, the perverse pleasures of compulsive proof-reading, the allure of long words, and the satisfactions of reading out loud. There is even a foray into pure literary gluttony--Charles Lamb liked buttered muffin crumbs between the leaves, and Fadiman knows of more than one reader who literally consumes page corners. Perfectly balanced between humor and erudition, Ex Libris establishes Fadiman as one of our finest contemporary essayists.",

The University of Virginia is one of America's greatest architectural treasures and one of Thomas Jefferson's proudest achievements. At his request his headstone says nothing of his service as America's first Secretary of State or its third President. It says simply: \"Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia.\" For this political genius was a supremely gifted artist as well, and of all Jefferson's stunning accomplishments, the school he built in Charlottesville is perhaps the most perfect expression of the man himself: as leader, as architect, and as philosopher. In this engrossing, perceptive book, Garry Wills once again displays the keen intelligence and eloquent style that have won him great critical praise as he explores the creation of a masterpiece, tracing its evolution from Jefferson's idea of an \"academical village\" into a classically beautiful campus. Mr. Jefferson's University is at once a wonderful chronicle of the birth of a national institution and a deft portrait of the towering American who brought it to life. \"There is much auspicious history to explore here, and Wills does so with great narrative skills.\" \u2014Richmond Times-Dispatch \"His command of the subject is formidable.\" \u2014Los Angeles Times",

Dominick Falconetti, an agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, is charged with heading a task force to investigate. Details at the crime scenes point to a drug connection, and when a highly-placed gang member disappears, it reinforces Dominick's suspicions that these cops were all involved in something unsavory.  C. J. Townsend, the state prosecutor he has loved for the past three years-ever since they met on the infamous Cupid investigation-is getting the calls in the middle of the night as well. As the state attorney who put Florida's last serial killer behind bars, she's the logical choice to help stop this one. But before long, C.J. begins to suspect that she knows an even more terrible secret than Dominick does about why these cops are being murdered.  A tense, gripping crime drama set against the richly detailed background of the Miami legal system and police department,  Last Witness is an extraordinary novel.",

        "Description": "In this bold and visionary book, two leading Christian thinkers explore the \"alien\" status of Christians in today's world and offer a compelling new vision of how the Christian church can regain its vitality, battle its malaise, reclaim its capacity to nourish souls, and stand firmly against the illusions, pretensions, and eroding values of today's world. Hauerwas and Willimon call for a radical new understanding of the church. By renouncing the emphasis on personal psychological categories, they offer a vision of the church as a colony, a holy nation, a people, a family standing for sharply focused values in a devalued world.",
