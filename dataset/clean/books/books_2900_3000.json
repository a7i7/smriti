        "Description": "His destination Antarctica, his expectations high, veteran explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton set out, on the eve of the First World War, in pursuit of his goal to lead the first expedition across the last unknown continent. Instead, his ship, the Endurance, became locked in sea ice, and for nine months Shackleton fought a losing battle with the elements before the drifting ship was crushed and his crew marooned. Shackleton's gripping account of his incredible voyage follows him and his men across 600 miles of unstable ice floes to a barren rock called Elephant Island. It records how, with a crew of four, he crossed 850 miles of the worst seas in a twenty-two-foot-long open boat and how, after landing on South Georgia Island, they then had to traverse over twenty miles of mountainous terrain to reach the nearest outpost of civilization. Shackleton recounts, too, the efforts of his support party aboard the Aurora, who in temperatures of -50 [degree] and winds of 80 m.p.h. still managed to drop off supplies on the opposite side of the continent, little suspecting the fate of the Endurance and the ordeal of its crew. The harrowing experience recounted in Shackleton's memoir is also strikingly illustrated with eighty-eight diagrams and original photographs taken in the course of this incredible voyage.",

        "Description": "A bewitching tale of the loves that comfort and the longings that haunt us. With sly humor, exquisite dialogue, smooth narrative, and a cast of wholly original characters, this new book by the widely acclaimed novelist and Booker-Prize nominee A. L. Barker explores the legendary Cornish forest and examines the human heart. At the Belle Chasse, a dilapidated seaside hotel on the tip of magical Cornwall, chaos slinks behind the limited amenities, as its weekend guests soon discover - among them, a second-rate artist who's driven a malfunctioning car across England to present his ex-wife with a nude he painted of her years before; a lonely child in need of a friend; and a couple in their sixties, Elissa and Owen Grierson, long-married and now plagued by the painful longings of a no longer magical relationship. If these travelers have come to a world haunted by ancient myths of heroic quests and holy grails, they themselves pursue more ordinary dreams as they stumble over their own enigmas and eccentricities in a way that prompted Auberon Waugh to declare that A. L. Barker \"writes like an angel and I love her.\" \"It is a glorious occasion to read a new novel by an author born in 1918 and to find it startlingly fresh, daring and instructive.\" - Times Literary Supplement; \"Almost dauntingly fresh - glancing, mercurial, elusive.\" - The Observer; \"Marries the deadpan timing of Kingsley Amis at his driest with a tinge of eerie nature-mysticism that brings Iris Murdoch to mind.... Hot, sparkling, exciting.\" - The Independent.",

Despite the best intentions of a generation, children today are still learning the dangerous lessons of prejudice, hate and bigotry. Ultimately, the only way to rid our society of the evil of racism is to teach our children, while they&#39;re still impressionable, that color is not an indication of a person&#39;s worth. Unfortunately, many parents are at a loss as to how to do this effectively. 40 Ways to Raise a Nonracist Child is the perfect aid for these parents. Divided into five age-related sections, ranging from preschool age to the teenage years, it provides helpful and practical ways parents can teach these important lessons, and contains specific advice addressing the unique concerns of both white parents and parents of color. With topics ranging from how to select toys for toddlers to how to talk with teenagers about what they see on the evening news, 40 Ways to Raise a Nonracist Child is a book all concerned parents will want to have on their shelves.",
