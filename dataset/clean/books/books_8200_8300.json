        "Description": "The wind in your hair, the sun on your face, and the world at your wheels-there's nothing like the freedom and exhilaration of driving with the top down. Clark Gable drove a convertible. So did Elvis, Rita Hayworth, and Gary Cooper. Jay Gatsby drove one in the book, and Thelma and Louise rode off in one in the movie. On the road, and in film, art, and literature, the convertible is more than just a car -it's a state of mind, a way of life. Automotive expert Ken Vose traces the evolution of the convertible as car and cultural icon, from the earliest ragtop to the open car of the future. Vose knows that every car (and every driver) has a story, and he recounts the best ones about classic Pierce-Arrows, Packards, Speedsters, Roadsters, Dusenbergs, and Bugattis - as well as today's Corvettes, Miatas, BMWs, Mustangs, and Prowlers. This witty tribute includes more than 125 photographs, illustrations, and other memorabilia, including rare vintage shots and art created specifically for this volume. This fast-lane celebration of the glamour, allure, and style of the ultimate dream machine is as much fun as a summer spin on an open road. Almost.",

        "Description": "In the tradition of Under the Tuscan Sun and A Year in Provence, here is Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson\u2019s ode to his personal paradise\u2013his adopted home, New Zealand. After living in California, why did Masson settle\u2013 out of all the places on earth\u2013in such a faraway land? It turns out that while visiting a beautiful sandy beach just fifteen minutes from bustling Auckland, Masson and his family were utterly seduced by the exotic locale. There was little deliberation. This place, surrounded by lush forest on a bay dotted with volcanic islands, would be their new home.Masson takes readers on a remarkable journey to another world, as he and his family \u201cslip into\u201d the paradise that is New Zealand. For anyone who has ever dreamed of finding utopia, Masson reveals a country where neighbors talk to one another and provide a sense of real community\u2013rarely, outside of the big cities, locking their doors\u2013and where politics are as mellow as the weather. New Zealand is also a land of spectacular scenery, made even more famous for being the shooting location for the Lord of the Rings films. The flora is plentiful. Mangroves, banana plants, papaya trees, and more than ten thousand species of ferns grow wild and freely. The fauna is benign. There are no snakes, tarantulas, or scorpions. Children can walk to school barefoot without a care\u2013 there is nothing to sting them, bite them, or give them a rash. In the blue waters near the lush coastline, dolphins and orcas abound. While describing his love affair with the country and his affinity for its citizens, Masson reflects on the meaning of home, the importance of acting on intuition, and what happens when we lose our connection to the place we live in. Responding to an impulse, Masson reveals, he realized a dream.Featuring a its glossary of phrases used by New Zealanders and important Maori words, as well as the author\u2019s recommended travel itinerary, Slipping into Paradise is ideal for anyone planning a visit to this exquisite land. Full of photographs, delightful anecdotes, and little-known facts (jogging, for example, was invented in New Zealand), Slipping into Paradise is also a book for those who fantasize about dramatically changing their lives\u2013and who imagine something better for themselves. Jeffrey Masson\u2019s message: New Zealand awaits.",

The narrative moves from the sober industriousness of a Kentucky farm to the hippie lifestyle of the countercultural 1960s; from a New York fan magazine to the shock-therapy ward of a mental institution; from a county poorhouse to the set of a Hollywood movie; from a small rustic schoolhouse to glittering pop music concerts. In the process of recounting her own odyssey--the story of a misfit girl who dreamed of distant places--Mason depicts the changes that have come to family, to women, and to heartland America in the twentieth century. Ultimately,  Clear Springs is a heartfelt portrait of an extended family, and a profound affirmation of the importance of family love.",

        "Description": "A brilliant and original memoir of midlife-a writing life, a reading life, a woman's life-by the distinguished author of Parallel LivesPhyllis Rose, a biographer, essayist, and literary critic, finally got around to reading Proust in middle age. As Rose learned, you don't have to live through an unhappy childhood or celebrity adulthood to write an autobiography. You just need patience, candor, and a close-to-scientific passion for truth. She begins to learn how to navigate the intricacies of Proust's novels, at the same time reflecting on the course of her own life.With striking honesty, Rose writes about marriage, friendship, childbirth, and her own mortality. As she moves from daily experience to what she's read and back again, she illuminates how the close reading of her own life reveals truths for the rest of us and how such a subtle celebration of books can help us live.",

In the woods, where land mines still lie undetected, the fifteen-year-old Madge sneaks off after dark to tryst with a German P.O.W.

        "Description": "It has often been said that \"if white America has a case of the sniffles, Black America catches walking pneumonia.\" When this credo is applied to relationships, common problems such as inadequate communication, commitment fears, financial struggles and infidelity carry an even greater weight. Yet, with hundreds of relationship books on the market, virtually none has explored the specific circumstances impacting relationships between African-American men and women. In The Best Kind of Loving: A Black Woman's Guide to Finding Intimacy, renowned psychologist Dr. Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant addresses head-on the complex challenges in African-American relationships. \"In addition to the social dynamics affecting male-female communications in general, as African-Americans, we carry the added burdens of myths and stereotypes that grow out of our real history of slavery, second-class citizenship and economic disenfranchisement,\" Grant explains. In writing The Best Kind of Loving, Grant has provided an invaluable resource for Black women searching to understand the choices they make, the men they love and how to make the most of their strength, intelligence and wit. Compulsively readable, The Best Kind of Loving is unique in its scope and vision; women of all races and backgrounds will laugh, sympathize and nod their heads in recognition as they read about others not unlike themselves. Giving both pragmatic and realistic advice, Grant serves both as an advisor and confidant; she knows which situations may not work out, but also gives women ways to make the best of less-than-ideal circumstances.",

        "Title": "LETITIA BALDRIGES MORE THAN MANNERS : Raising Today's Kids to Have Kind Manners and Good Hearts",
        "Authors": "By Baldrige, Letitia",
        "Description": "American families are sick of rudeness, aggression, and unruly behavior. They are searching for ways to cool down society -- and bring up kids who win at life by peaceful, compassionate, and rational means, rather than the opposite. This is the book that casts out a new lifeline to them and speaks positively to their deepest needs and yearnings.  Explaining that kindness is the heart and core of civility and manners in any society, Letitia Baldrige, America's number one best-selling authority on manners, has finally written the book that millions have been waiting for: a road map to raising and guiding kids who succeed in life through decency and honor.  \"It all starts in the home,\" says Baldrige, as she shows parents and other concerned adults how to teach kids to:  Gain respect and become leaders -- at home, at school, and in the larger world -- without becoming wimps or bullies.  Defuse explosive situations with words and actions that turn hostility into harmony.  Use conciliation instead of confrontation with peers, authority figures, and others.  Be courteous and compassionate with family and friends and out in public while still standing up for themselves.  Learn behaviors that will make them liked and respected and will make the world around them a better place as they grow up.  And much more...  Baldrige accomplishes this using real-life examples of encounters between adults and young people and the day-to-day interactions between young peers -- at home, at school, and out in the world -- plus the compelling and often personal true stories and anecdotes that have made her other books so warm and conversational and loved by millions.  In his longtime best-selling Book of Virtues, William Bennett showed us the values we should strive for to get life back on track again. In her book, Letitia Baldrige shows us how to apply those principles in everyday life, twenty-four hours a day -- and get results!",

But if what you folks are about to read is any indication, we've all got a lot to worry about. The question that presents itself is whether the near pathological dizziness and irrationality in our society has so invaded this nation's marrow that, like a wild-infectious virus, even the Supreme Court is not immune.\"--from NO ISLAND OF SANITYNow, in the powerful premiere of the Library of Contemporary Thought, Vincent Bugliosi takes a timely swipe at the Supreme Court's decision in Paula Jones v. Bill Clinton. Famed as the prosecutor of Charles Manson and author of the classic bestseller HELTER SKELTER, Bugliosi argues that the high court has rarely been proved so wrong, so fast. NO ISLAND OF SANITY is only the beginning of an ongoing dialogue with some of the most original writers working today. Each month, the Library of Contemporary Thought will bring you a different voice on a hot-button topic in American life, politics, and culture. From Mickey Mouse to Tiger Woods, from how we age to how we read, no subject is too controversial or too unlikely for these powerful and provocative books.",

        "Title": "It Looks Like a President Only Smaller: Trailing Campaign 2000",
        "Authors": "By Achenbach, Joel",
        "Description": "It Looks Like a President Only Smaller is the hilarious, eviscerating diary of one of the most amazing contests in American political history -- from the presidential primaries in New Hampshire, to the fat-cat convention parties in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, to the bizarre vote-counting debacle in Florida. The diarist is a veteran Washington Post reporter, satirist, and explainer of the inexplicable.  This is his summary of the historic Supreme Court decision in Bush v. Gore: \"In keeping with the Court's ambition to provide an unambiguous and unanimous decision in Bush v. Gore and thereby legitimate the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, we present herein a majority opinion signed by Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, Thomas, O'Connor, and Kennedy, with a partial dissent to the majority by Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas, a full dissent by Justices Stevens, Souter, Breyer, and Ginsburg, a partial dissent to the full dissent by Justices Breyer and Souter, a needling, invective-filled dissent to the partial dissent to the majority opinion from Scalia, and a spitwad [attached] from Justice Stevens...The Court will note that it did manage on Tuesday afternoon to assemble a respectable 6-3 majority in favor of the Chinese take-out.\"  As Joel Achenbach trails Campaign 2000, he channels the unfocused rage of the street protesters, gleefully infiltrates celebrity-choked Hollywood bashes, and roams the remote highways of the battleground states. Whether ruminating on the Confederate flag controversy in South Carolina, rewriting breaking news in the form of a le Carr\u00e9 novel, or mimicking the dyspeptic voice of the editor of the (fictional) newsletter Chad Watch, Achenbach fashions a page-turning comedy that takes the measure of America at the millennium.",

Despite Tony's name, however, their decision to move to Chianti was not based on heritage, nor any knowledge of the Italian language or spirit that had failed to pass down the line to him.Hardly expecting things to be straightforward, Tony and Mira set about raising a loan to purchase Collelungo, the dilapidated property they had set their hearts on converting into an 'agriturismo' hotel. Complications and misinterpretations followed hot on the heels of each other, and before long they found themselves in trouble with the local bank which promised them one billion Lire and then withdrew.Attracting guests turned out to be a tougher task than they had anticipated, and it was not long before the Roccas realised that alternative avenues would have to be explored to increase their income. Keeping on the hospitality business, Tony was persuaded by Mira to experiment with the vines that had been part of the property purchase. Sceptical though he was about the investment involved, the success of these wines was unprecedented.",

        "Description": "In a natural follow-up to her national bestseller Front Row at the White House, the dean of the White House press corps presents a vivid and personal chronicle of the American presidency. Currently a columnist for Hearst and a former White House bureau chief for UPI, Helen Thomas has covered an astounding nine presidential administrations -- from Kennedy through George W. Bush -- endearing herself with her trademark \"Thank you, Mr. President\" at the conclusion of White House press conferences. Here, in a riveting chapter for each administration she has covered, Thomas delights, informs, spins yarns, and offers opinions on the commanders in chief and their families. She tells about Kennedy's love of sparring with the press, the memorable invitation LBJ extended to Hubert Humphrey to become his running mate, and Reagan's down-home ways of avoiding the press's tougher questions. As entertaining and compelling as Helen Thomas herself, Thanks for the Memories, Mr. President is a unique glimpse into presidential history.",

His visits are infrequent, and they know him only as \"the scribbling one.\" Bit by bit, however, he begins to share with them his poetry of star-crossed lovers, a jailed English king, a murderous moneylender, a fairy queen. By the edge of the River Avon, the twins devise games based on their father's wondrous poetry to entertain each other whenever he is away.Then, after a dark family tragedy, young Judith happens on a scrap copy of her father's newest play, left behind in his haste to return to London. She reads it, and is shocked to find it a comic treatment of her family's grief, especially her own.

But the city is a revelation to her, as is her father's world of the theater, and his new playhouse, the Globe.

But black parents face an even more challenging task: they must actively combat negative messages of racism while teaching their children to succeed in a white-dominated culture. \u00a0 In this thorough guide to parenting, two noted child psychiatrists, both African-American, focus on the special concerns of black parents.

At a time when much of America is yearning to recapture the spirit and feelings of a more innocent era, comes this exceptional new book from one of our most beloved actresses: a story of one woman's journey to reconnect with the landscape of her childhood.Though best known today as the star of the television series Once & Again and Sisters, Sela Ward considers herself first and foremost a small-town girl. The eldest of four children, she was raised by a father who helped her believe in herself, and by a mother who taught her a sense of the importance of virtues like self-respect, grace, and sacrifice. In her hometown of Meridian, Mississippi, within a tightly-knit community of neighbors and kin, Sela learned ways that would remain with her throughout life -- humble virtues that were \"forged in the hearth of a loving home.\" After graduating from the University of Alabama, Sela left the South in search of the excitement of cities like New York and Los Angeles, and the creative rewards of an acting career. But as she started her own family, she found herself pining for the comforts of her small-town childhood -- and searching for a way to balance her children's West Coast upbringing with a taste of a more natural way of life. She and her husband built a second home on a farm there, where she and her family could retreat several times each year, and became involved in several projects designed to restore the vitality of the hometown she remembered so fondly. Even as Sela was reconnecting with the rhythms of home, though, her world was rocked by a crisis the family had long anticipated but never quite prepared for -- the death of her mother. As her family gathered around her mama's bedside, Sela's simple journey home became something far deeper: a turning point in her own life, as she pondered her mother's complicated legacy, and came to terms with just what it was she herself was searching for.Filled with warmth, storytelling, and laughter, Homesick is a book to treasure: an exploration of the lessons we carry away with us from childhood, and a celebration of the bittersweet legacy of home.",

        "Description": "Calvin Trillin, the celebrated New Yorker writer, offers a rich and engaging biography of his father, as well as a literate and entertaining fanfare for the common (and decent, and hard-working) man.Abe Trillin had the western Missouri accent of someone who had grown up in St. Joseph and the dreams of America of someone who had been born is Russia. In Kansas City, he was a grocer, at least until he swore off the grocery business. He was given to swearing off things\u2014coffee, tobacco, alcohol, all neckties that were not yellow in color. Presumably he had also sworn off swearing, although he was a collector of curses, such as \"May you have an injury that is not covered by workman's compensation.\" Although he had a strong vision of the sort of person he wanted his son to be, his explicit advice about how to behave didn't go beyond an almost lackadaisical \"You might as well be a mensch.\" Somehow, though, Abe Trillin's messages got through clearly.The author's unerring sense of the American character is everywhere apparent in this quietly powerful memoir, Messages from My Father.",

        "Description": "Struggling to hold on to the illusion of youth, Friedan wrote, we have denied the reality and evaded the new triumphs of growing older. We have seen age only as decline. In this powerful and very personal book, Betty Friedan charted her own voyage of discovery, and that of others, into a different kind of aging.   Friedan found ordinary men and women, moving into their fifties, sixties, seventies, discovering extraordinary new possibilities of intimacy and purpose. In their surprising experiences, Friedan first glimpsed, then embraced, the idea that one can grow and evolve throughout life in a style that dramatically mitigates the expectation of decline and opens the way to a further dimension of \"personhood.\"   The Fountain of Age suggests new possibilities for every one of us, all founded on a solid body of startling but little-known scientific evidence. It demolishes those myths that have constrained us for too long and offers compelling alternatives for living one's age as a unique, exuberant time of life, on its own authentic terms.",

        "Title": "Lawrence and the Women: The Intimate Life of D.H. Lawrence",
        "Authors": "By Feinstein, Elaine",
        "Description": "D. H. Lawrence is recognized as one of the greatest novelists of this century. His work is taught in schools and universities all over the world. Yet, more than thirty years after the failure to ban Lady Chatterley's Lover in England fundamentally changed the moral climate of that country and of America, Lawrence remains a controversial figure. Regarded by many women during his lifetime as a sexual prophet, in recent years his supposed misogyny has drawn fierce condemnation from feminist critics.In this new biography of Lawrence, Elaine Feinstein explores his relationships with the women in his own life, many of whom have their counterparts in his novels. She traces the obsessive nature of his love for his mother, Lydia; his difficult relationship with his first sweetheart, Jessie Chambers; his pursuit of the bisexual Helen Corke; and the failure of his youthful engagement to Louisa Burrows. She gives a fascinating account of his long, battling marriage to Frieda von Richthofen; his friendships with women writers like Katherine Mansfield and Catherine Carswell; and the attachment to Lawrence of patronesses such as Lady Ottoline Morrell, Lady Cynthia Asquith and Mabel Dodge Luhan.Lawrence and the Women investigates the paradoxes of Lawrence's personality. He was considered to have a rare understanding of women's sexuality, yet his own sexual relationships were unusually difficult. He put all his faith in the energies of the body, yet his own was frail and sickly. He argued that women needed to submit to men, but he never succeeded in dominating his own wife, Frieda.With a novelist's eye for detail and uncanny intuition about character, Elaine Feinstein probes the sources of Lawrence's attitudes toward women with candor and compassion. Always responsive to the poetry and power of his writing, she offers a fresh and surprising portrait of one of the most misunderstood literary figures of our time.",

        "Description": "Five years after his everywhere\u2013acclaimed, brilliantly successful, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning book about God as portrayed in the Old Testament\u2014God: A Biography\u2014Jack Miles gives us his striking consideration of Christ. He presents Christ as a hero of literature based only in part on the historical Jesus, asking us to take the idea of Christ as God Incarnate not as a dogma of religion but as the premise of a work of art, the New Testament.As this story begins, God has not kept his promise to end the five-hundred-year-long oppression of the Children of Israel and return them to greatness. Under Rome, their latest oppressor, the Jews face a holocaust. This is God\u2019s supreme crisis. Astonishingly, God resolves the dilemma by becoming a Jew himself, Christ, inflicting upon himself in advance the very agony his people will suffer, revising in the process the meaning of victory and defeat. By dying and rising as Christ, God not only swallows up the historical defeat of the Jews but also offers the promise of a cosmic victory that will \u201cwipe away every tear\u201d for all mankind.In telling this remarkable tale, Miles offers the shock of the familiar reframed and reimagined:--When Christ undergoes a baptism of repentance at the Jordan, it is God who is repenting.--Since no one can kill God, the Crucifixion is actually a sacred suicide.--When after preaching \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d Christ refuses to defend himself against his own enemies, what he means to say is that God will never again come militarily to any nation\u2019s rescue.The story ends in joy. Having assigned himself the role of Passover lamb, Christ, God Incarnate, expands God\u2019s covenant with Israel\u2014the covenant of the original Passover\u2014to include all the children of Adam and Eve. In the final scene of the New Testament, this covenant becomes a marriage in heaven.A writer of exceptional eloquence and imagination, profound literary sensibility, Jack Miles has captured once again the lost, fierce, ecstatic power of the greatest work in our literature.",
