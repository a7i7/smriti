I got bored, so I thought I'd reestablish our relationship. Give us both something to do in our later years. Stay tuned. Spare Change  When a serial murderer dubbed \"The Spare Change Killer\" by the Boston press surfaces after three decades in hiding, the police immediately seek out the cop, now retired, who headed the original task force: Phil Randall. As a sharp-eyed investigator and a doting parent (\"You're smart. You're tough. You, too, are a paradigm of law enforcement perfection, and you're my kid\"), Phil calls on his daughter, Sunny, to help catch the criminal who eluded him so many years before.  Sunny is certain that she's found her man after interviewing just a handful of suspects. Though she has no evidence against Bob Johnson, she trusts her intuition. And she knows the power she has over him-she can feel the skittishness and sexual tension that he radiates when he's around her-but persuading her father and the rest of the task force is a different story.  When the killer strikes a second and third time, the murders take a macabre turn, as the victims each eerily resemble Sunny. While her father pressures her to drop the case, Sunny's need to create a trap to nab her killer grows.  In a compelling game of cat-and-mouse, Sunny uses all her skills to draw out her prey, realizing too late that she's setting herself up to become the next victim.",

His presence soon draws Gelis and their son Jodi to Scotland, as well as Nicholas's companions and subordinates in many a past endeavor - Dr. Tobias and his wife Clemence, Mick Crackbene, John le Grant, and Andro Wodman among them. Here, too, Nicholas meets again with others who have had an influence, for good or evil, in his life: King James III of Scotland and his rebellious siblings; the St. Pols: Jordan, Simon, and young Henry; Mistress Bel of Cuthilgurdy and David de Salmeton; Anselm Adorne and Kathi his niece. Caught up in, and sometimes molding, the course of great events, Nicholas exhibits by turns the fierce silence with which he masks his secrets, and the explosive, willful gaiety that binds men, women, and children to him. And as the secrets of his birth and heritage come to light, Nicholas has to decide whether he desires to establish a future in Scotland for himself and his family, and a home for his descendants.",

Beck and his associates set forth their seminal argument that depression arises from a \"cognitive triad\" of errors and from the idiosyncratic way that one infers, recollects, and generalizes. From the initial interview to termination, many helpful case examples demonstrate how cognitive-behavioral interventions can loosen the grip of \"depressogenic\" thoughts and assumptions. Guidance is provided for working with individuals and groups to address the full range of problems that patients face, including suicidal ideation and possible relapse.",

As a boy, he never knew what would set his father off--maybe the ice cubes had melted in his glass of Tab, maybe dinner was overcooked or undercooked or the gravy was too runny. Regardless, the beatings always came. As did the twisted games of cat and mouse--being thrown from a rowboat into frigid Lake Michigan, the middle-of-the-night moves to different states, or being left to dangle over a ten-story balcony while his father watched from inside. But one fateful night when the police answered the call, the truth came to light from the shadows, sparking national headlines: Chip St. Clair's entire life--his name, even his date of birth--had been a lie, and the man he called 'Dad' was an impostor, an escaped child killer who had been on the run for over two decades. The stunning revelation would send one of America's Most Wanted to justice and another on a quest for his true identity.With chilling detail and a riveting, lyrical narrative, The Butterfly Garden reveals St. Clair's struggle to piece together his haunted past before it consumes him and shares his inspiring metamorphosis from victim to victim's advocate. The Butterfly Garden is a timeless triumph, a reminder that hope can be the most powerful of all emotions, freeing us to soar despite the past and the odds against us.",

        "Title": "The Princes of Ireland: The Dublin Saga",
        "Authors": "By Rutherfurd, Edward",
        "Description": "From the bestselling author of London and Sarum\u2014amagnificent epic about love and   battle, family life and political intrigue in Ireland over the course of eleven centuries.    The Princes of Ireland brilliantly weaves impeccable historical research and mesmerizing   storytelling in capturing the essence of a place and its people. Edward Rutherfurd   has introduced millions of readers to the human dramas that are the lifeblood of   history.  From his first bestseller, Sarum, to the  international sensation London,   he has captivated audiences with gripping narratives that follow the fortunes of   several fictional families down through the ages.\u00a0The Princes of Ireland, a sweeping   panorama steeped in the tragedy and glory that is Ireland, epitomizes the power and   richness of Rutherfurd's storytelling magic. The saga begins in tribal, pre-Christian   Ireland during the reign of the fierce and mighty High Kings at Tara, with the tale   of two lovers, the princely Conall and the ravishing Deirdre, whose travails cleverly   echo the ancient Celtic legend of Cuchulainn.  From that stirring beginning, Rutherfurd   takes the reader on a powerfully-imagined journey through the centuries.  Through   the interlocking stories of a memorable cast of characters\u2014druids and chieftains,   monks and smugglers, noblewomen and farmwives, merchants and mercenaries, rebels   and cowards\u2014we see Ireland through the lens of its greatest city.  While vividly   and movingly conveying the passions and struggles that shaped the character of Dublin,   Rutherfurd portrays the major events in Irish history:  The tribal culture of pagan   Ireland; the mission of St. Patrick; the coming of the Vikings and the founding of   Dublin; the glories of the great nearby monastery of Glendalough and the making of   treasures like the Book of Kells; the extraordinary career of Brian Boru; the trickery   of Henry II, which gave England its first foothold in Medieval Ireland.  The stage   is then set for the great conflict between the English kings and the princes of Ireland,    and the disastrous Irish invasion of England, which incurred the wrath of Henry   VIII and where this book, the first of  the two part Dublin Saga, draws to a close,   as the path of Irish history takes a dramatic and irrevocable turn. Rich, colorful   and impeccably researched, The Princes of Ireland is epic entertainment spun by a   master.",

You were great. We want you.\" I can now trace my manic adult tendencies to this moment. It was the first time I felt deeply thrilled about something just a fraction of an instant after being completely crushed. I believe those three words \"We want you\" were enough to cause my brain to rewire itself, and from then on, I would require more than other people....- from Magical Thinking's \"Commercial Break\"A contest of wills with a deranged cleaning lady. The execution of a rodent carried out with military precision and utter horror. Telemarketing revenge. A different kind of \"roof work.\" Dating an undertaker who shows up in a minivan. This is the fabric of Augusten Burroughs's life:  a collection of true stories that are universal in their appeal yet unabashedly intimate, stories that shine a flashlight into both dark and hilarious places.

The third part, \"Like Beauty,\" evokes a New York 150 years into the future, when the city is all but overwhelmed by refugees from the first inhabited planet to be contacted by the people of Earth.Presiding over each episode of this interrelated whole is the prophetic figure of the poet Walt Whitman, who promised his future readers, \"It avails not, neither time or place . . . I am with you, and know how it is.\" Specimen Days is a genre-bending, haunting, and transformative ode to life in our greatest city, and a meditation on the direction and meaning of America's destiny. It is a work of surpassing power and beauty by one of the most original and daring writers at work today.",

In The Stakes: America and the Middle East, Shibley Telhami, one of America\u2019s most in-demand commentators on the Middle East, provides a concise and penetrating analysis that explains Arab and Muslim attitudes toward the United States and shows why there is much reason for concern. In an insightful, passionate, yet balanced analysis, Telhami provides new perspectives on the collapse of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the attending escalation of violence. He shows why the Arab-Israeli conflict remains central to the war on terrorism and to international stability, and considers American policy toward Iraq and the Persian Gulf. He demonstrates the need for political change in the region\u2019s oil states and suggests how best to achieve it. The Stakes provides a well-reasoned, calm analysis that will be essential reading for anyone who wonders where America should go from here, amid the dangers and opportunities in the ever-volatile Middle East.",

        "Description": "James Lilley's life and family have been entwined with China's fate since his father moved to the country to work for Standard Oil in 1916. Lilley spent much of his childhood in China and after a Yale professor took him aside and suggested a career in intelligence, it became clear that he would spend his adult life returning to China again and again. Lilley served for twenty-five years in the CIA in Laos, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taiwan before moving to the State Department in the early 1980s to begin a distinguished career as the U.S.'s top-ranking diplomat in Taiwan, ambassador to South Korea, and finally, ambassador to China. From helping Laotian insurgent forces assist the American efforts in Vietnam to his posting in Beijing during the Tiananmen Square crackdown, he was in a remarkable number of crucial places during challenging times as he spent his life tending to America's interests in Asia. In China Hands, he includes three generations of stories from an American family in the Far East, all of them absorbing, some of them exciting, and one, the loss of Lilley's much loved and admired brother, Frank, unremittingly tragic.China Hands is a fascinating memoir of America in Asia, Asia itself, and one especially capable American's personal history.",

It could have been for assault or petty larceny: by chance, it was for murder and rape. Native Son tells the story of this young black man caught in a downward spiral after he kills a young white woman in a brief moment of panic. Set in Chicago in the 1930s, Wright's powerful novel is an unsparing reflection of the poverty and feelings of hopelessness experienced by people in inner cities across the country and of what it means to be black in America.  \"This new edition gives us a Native Son in which the key line in the key scene is restored to the great good fortune of American letters. The scene as we now have it is central both to an ongoing conversation among African-American writers and critics and to the consciousness among all American readers of what it means to live in a multi-racial society in which power splits among racial lines.\" --Jack Miles, Los Angeles Times",

He also invented bifocals, a stove that is still manufactured, a water-harmonica, and the lightning rod. Franklin's extraordinary range of interests and accomplishments are brilliantly recorded in his Autobiography, considered one of the classics of the genre. Covering his life up to his prewar stay in London as representative of the Pennsylvania Assembly, this charming self-portrait recalls Franklin's boyhood, his determination to achieve high moral standards, his work as a printer, experiments with electricity, political career, experiences during the French and Indian War, and more. Related in an honest, open, unaffected style, this highly readable account offers a wonderfully intimate glimpse of the Founding Father sometimes called \"the wisest American.\"",

In this much anticipated sequel to his international bestseller Hegemony or Survival, Noam Chomsky turns the tables, charging the United States with being a \u201cfailed state,\u201d and thus a danger to its own people and the world. \u201cFailed states\u201d Chomsky writes, are those \u201cthat do not protect their citizens from violence and perhaps even destruction, that regard themselves as beyond the reach of domestic or international law, and that suffer from a \u2018democratic deficit,\u2019 having democratic forms but with limited substance.\u201d Exploring recent U.S. foreign and domestic policies, Chomsky assesses Washington\u2019s escalation of the nuclear risk; the dangerous consequences of the occupation of Iraq; and America\u2019s self-exemption from international law. He also examines an American electoral system that frustrates genuine political alternatives, thus impeding any meaningful democracy.Forceful, lucid, and meticulously documented, Failed States offers a comprehensive analysis of a global superpower that has long claimed the right to reshape other nations while its own democratic institutions are in severe crisis, and its policies and practices have recklessly placed the world on the brink of disaster. Systematically dismantling America\u2019s claim to being the world\u2019s arbiter of democracy, Failed States is Chomsky\u2019s most focused\u2014and urgent\u2014critique to date.",

To understand why the world has turned against the United States, the Pew Research Center, under the leadership of Andrew Kohut, has undertaken an unprecedented survey of world opinion\u2014more than 91,000 respondents in fifty nations. In America Against the World, Kohut and Bruce Stokes unveil the sobering and surprising findings.America\u2019s image is at a low ebb: where once it was considered the champion of democracy, America is now seen as a self-absorbed, militant hyperpower. More than 70 percent of non-Americans say that the world would be improved if America faced a rival military power, and about half the citizens of Lebanon, Jordan, and Morocco think that suicide attacks on Americans in Iraq are justified. Where does this anti-Americanism come from? Kohut and Stokes find that what pushed the world away is American exceptionalism\u2014our individualism and our go-it-alone attitude. And it doesn\u2019t help that Americans\u2019 pervasive religiosity and deep patriotism are often exaggerated by America\u2019s critics. Former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright argues in her foreword that we cannot stop the spread of anti-Americanism without truly understanding who we are. America Against the World provides the insight to take that step.",

Why buy a multi-billion-dollar satellite and go to extreme lengths to try to avoid governmental detection when you can just buy a bit of airtime and send one of several million messages going out at any given time?from Bombs and Bandwidth Information Technology (IT) has become central to the way governments, businesses, social movements and even terrorist and criminal organizations pursue their increasingly globalized objectives. With the emergence of the Internet and new digital technologies, traditional boundaries are increasingly irrelevant, and traditional conceptsfrom privacy to surveillance, vulnerability, and above all, securityneed to be reconsidered.

        "Description": "From the author of the prophetic national bestseller Blowback, a startling look at militarism, American style, and its consequences abroad and at home In the years after the Soviet Union imploded, the United States was described first as the globe\u2019s \u201clone superpower,\u201d then as a \u201creluctant sheriff,\u201d next as the \u201cindispensable nation,\u201d and now, in the wake of 9/11, as a \u201cNew Rome.\u201d Here, Chalmers Johnson thoroughly explores the new militarism that is transforming America and compelling its people to pick up the burden of empire.Reminding us of the classic warnings against militarism\u2014from George Washington\u2019s farewell address to Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s denunciation of the military-industrial complex\u2014Johnson uncovers its roots deep in our past. Turning to the present, he maps America\u2019s expanding empire of military bases and the vast web of services that supports them. He offers a vivid look at the new caste of professional warriors who have infiltrated multiple branches of government, who classify as \u201csecret\u201d everything they do, and for whom the manipulation of the military budget is of vital interest. Among Johnson\u2019s provocative conclusions is that American militarism is putting an end to the age of globalization and bankrupting the United States, even as it creates the conditions for a new century of virulent blowback. The Sorrows of Empire suggests that the former American republic has already crossed its Rubicon\u2014with the Pentagon leading the way.",

Here is their story as reimagined by Thomas Pynchon, in an updated 18th-century novel featuring Native Americans and frontier folk, ripped bodices, naval warfare, conspiracies erotic and political, and major caffeine abuse.Unreflectively entangled in crimes of demarcation, Mason and Dixon take us long on a grand tour of the Enlightenment's dark hemisphere, from their first journey together to the Cape of Good Hope, to pre-Revolutionary American and back to England, into the shadowy yet redemptive turns of their later lives, through incongruities in conscience, parallaxes of personality, tales of questionable altitude told and intimated by voices clamoring not to be lost.Along the way they encounter a plentiful cast of characters, including Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Samuel Johnson, as well as a Chinese feng shui master, a Swedish irredentist, a talking dog, and a robot duck. The quarrelsome, daring, mismatched pair - Mason as melancholy and Gothic as Dixon is cheerful and pre-Romantic - pursue a linear narrative of irregular lives, observing, and managing to participate in, the many occasions of madness presented them by the Age of Reason.",

Also used as a synonym for aborigine, it comes from a Greek word meaning sprung from that land itself.*Camorra: a secret society, usually one breaking the law. This word comes from the name of group that was active in Naples in the nineteenth century.*Snollygoster: a dishonest politician, especially a shrewd or calculating one. A connection has been proposed between this word and snallygaster, a mythical monster of Maryland, invented to frighten freed slaves. However, the first evidence for snallygaster follows snollygoster by about a hundred years, making a connection (in this direction, at least) unlikely.*Tigon: the hybrid offspring of a male tiger and a lioness. A liger is the offspring produced by a male lion and a tigress.",

        "Description": "In his acclaimed career as a perennial bestselling author, Richard North Patterson has established himself as one of our most important voices in fiction and a keeper of the American conscience. He consistently writes novels that are intensely dramatic and deeply thought provoking. Now, in Conviction, Patterson tackles one of the most emotional and complex of all legal debates: When, if ever, does the state have the right to exact the ultimate punishment\u2013and is the death penalty a crime unto itself? Fifty-nine days. That\u2019s how long Rennell Price has to live\u2013after spending fifteen years on death row for the horrifying sexual assault and murder of a girl whose body was found floating in San Francisco Bay. But attorney Terri Paget, who has fought her own way out of hopelessness and abuse, has dedicated her life to fighting for people like Rennell Price. This time, Terri has a client she believes may actually be innocent, which means that an unpunished killer may still be free.\u201cI didn\u2019t do that little girl\u201d is all Rennell Price has ever said in his own defense. In a trial, Rennell, along with his older brother, Payton, was found guilty of the heinous crime, and the conviction has been upheld through one appeal after another. But as Terri spends time with Rennell and re-creates the events that put him on death row\u2013beginning with the first minutes of the police investigation\u2013she starts to understand the forces that shaped Rennell and the reason he has never been able to defend himself adequately.As Terri prepares for a last appeal, she gets a new weapon for her battle\u2013fresh evidence suggesting that another man, not Rennell, helped Payton commit the atrocity. But the grim machinery of capital punishment is already in motion, involving precedent and politics reaching from California to the highest court in the nation. As more people are drawn into Terri\u2019s last-ditch battle, and as agendas and personalities clash while time is running out for Rennell Price, this much is clear: The serious doubts about Rennell\u2019s guilt may not be enough to save him.Conviction raises issues of ethics, political expediency, and personal trauma that will shake readers to their core. For here, in a novel of vivid characters on both sides of the law and profound tension on every page, Patterson illuminates the mysterious precincts between justice and truth\u2013where the fate of one man involves not only his own life and the lives he has affected but the moral life of a nation.",

        "Title": "I Know This Much Is True",
        "Authors": "By Lamb, Wally",
        "Description": "With his stunning debut novel, She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb won the adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap.Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control.Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful \"monkey\"; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle \"bunny.\" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it.But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched.",

        "Title": "Clash of Wings: World War II in the Air",
        "Authors": "By Boyne, Walter J.",
        "Description": "Clash of Wings is the first popularly written, comprehensive account of the role of air power over land and sea in World War II. Col. Walter J. Boyne, USAF (Ret.), brings extensive experience and an expert knowledge to this lively history.World War II was the first major war in history in which air power played a decisive role. Yet even today, fifty years after the events, there is still some disagreement about the lessons of the war. In this analysis of the major air powers, Col. Boyne offers some fascinating and surprising conclusions:Air superiority in Europe was not won until American bombers were used as bait to lure the German fighters up to be destroyed.The Soviet Union's Air Force has been terribly underrated; its key role in turning back the Nazi invasion is still not fully appreciated.The Japanese Air Force, while initially superb in equipment and training, was too small to engage in a world war; its initial successes derived from British and American unpreparedness. Later, the Japanese were reduced to futile, suicidal kamikaze tactics.The Germans did not realize the huge number of aircraft they needed until it was too late.The Allies were slow to use air power effectively, but when they did, they changed the course of the war. The Axis powers never altered their fundamental strategies, even as those strategies failed.Boyne carefully analyzes the important technological breakthroughs, such as radar, which gave the RAF the decisive advantage in the Battle of Britain, and the jet plane, which came too late to save Germany. He sheds new light on the controversies over the strategic bombing of Germany and Japan and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Clash of Wings also profiles the important, often colorful figures who directed the major air campaigns, among them Generals Arnold, Spaatz, LeMay, and Doolittle in the U.S.; Air Marshals Dowding and Harris in Britain; Reichsmarschall Goring and Generalleutnant Adolf Galland in Germany; Admiral Yamamoto in Japan; and General Balbo in Italy. Boyne discusses the principal air campaigns, including the invasions of Poland and Western Europe, the long hard fights in the desert, the mammoth campaign in Russia, and the day and night bombing campaigns, as well as the violent carrier battles that transformed war at sea from Pearl Harbor to Okinawa and beyond. In the process he applies his vast knowledge to critically evaluate all of the famous planes, both fighters and bombers, that made history, among them the Spitfire, Mustang, Hellcat, Fortress, Liberator, Messerschmitt, Thunderbolt, Zero, Shturmovik, and the B-29. He also analyzes lesser-known planes as well, including the Gladiator, Falco, Helldiver, Owl, and Oscar.Authoritatively researched and vividly written, Clash of Wings is a fresh, comprehensive look at pivotal events of World War II in the air.",

        "Authors": "By Masters, Brooke A.",
        "Description": "The rise to power of Eliot Spitzer, the scourge of Wall Street and one of America\u2019s most controversial politicians, by the reporter who knows his crusade bestFew politicians have burst onto the American scene with as much impact as Eliot Spitzer. He has exposed wrongdoing by stock analysts, mutual fund managers, and insurance brokers, and he has investigated corporations that have misled or defrauded investors and consumers. When federal regulators have fallen down on their responsibilities, Spitzer has stepped in to protect ordinary, middle-class Americans. His actions as the New York State attorney general have made companies change the way they do business, which in turn affects every American with a retirement plan, an insurance policy, or a prescription to fill. No reporter has had better or more complete behind-the-scenes access to Spitzer\u2019s operation\u2014and to the strategies that have underpinned his crusade against these powerful forces in the American economy\u2014than Brooke A. Masters of The Washington Post. In Spoiling for a Fight, she presents a portrait that is at once dramatic and revealing, raising the question of whether Spitzer\u2019s way of conducting government business is good or bad for America.Combining passion and zeal with a savvy understanding of the press, Spitzer has brought down some of the biggest names in American finance and now has his sights set on higher office. This revelatory book shows Americans how Spitzer has transformed their lives and what his crusade could mean for the future.",
