Harlan Coben published his first Myron Bolitar thriller, Deal Breaker, in 1995, introducing a hero that would captivate millions. Over the years we have watched Myron walk a tight rope between sports agent, friend, problem solver and private eye, his big heart quick to defend his client's interests so fiercely that he can't help but jump in to save them, no matter the cost. When former tennis star Suzze T and her rock star husband, Lex, encounter an anonymous Facebook post questioning the paternity of their unborn child, Lex runs off, and Suzze - at eight months pregnant - asks Myron to save her marriage, and perhaps her husband's life. But when he finds Lex, he also finds someone he wasn't looking for: his sister-in-law, Kitty, who along with Myron's brother abandoned the Bolitar family long ago. As Myron races to locate his missing brother while their father clings to life, he must face the lies that led to the estrangement - including the ones told by Myron himself. If we thought we knew Myron Bolitar, Coben now proves we didn't. An electric, stay-up-all night thriller that unfolds at a breakneck pace, Live Wire proves that Harlan Coben still has the ability to shock us anew. *Associated Press",

        "Description": "\u201cAmerican success or failure in Iraq may well depend on whether the Iraqis like American soldiers or not.\u201dThe U.S. military could certainly have used that bit of wisdom in 2003, as violence began to eclipse the Iraq War\u2019s early successes. Ironically, had the Army only looked in its own archives, they would have found it\u2014that piece of advice is from a manual the U.S. War Department handed out to American servicemen posted in Iraq back in 1943.The advice in Instructions for American Servicemen in Iraq during World War II,presented here in a new facsimile edition, retains a surprising, even haunting, relevance in light of today\u2019s muddled efforts to win Iraqi hearts and minds. Designed to help American soldiers understand and cope with what was at the time an utterly unfamiliar culture\u2014the manual explains how to pronounce the word Iraq, for instance\u2014this brief, accessible handbook mixes do-and-don\u2019t-style tips (\u201cAlways respect the Moslem women.\u201d \u201cTalk Arabic if you can to the people. No matter how badly you do it, they will like it.\u201d) with general observations on Iraqi history and society. The book\u2019s overall message still rings true\u2014dramatically so\u2014more than sixty years later: treat an Iraqi and his family with honor and respect, and you will have a strong ally; treat him with disrespect and you will create an unyielding enemy.With a foreword by Lieutenant Colonel John A. Nagl reflecting on the manual\u2019s continuing applicability\u2014and lamenting that it was unknown at the start of the invasion\u2014this new edition ofInstructions for American Servicemen in Iraq will be essential reading for anyone who cares about the future of Iraq and the fate of the American soldiers serving there.",

        "Description": "In this extraordinary bestseller, Steven Pinker, one of the world's leading cognitive scientists, does for the rest of the mind what he did for language in his 1994 book, The Language Instinct. He explains what the mind is, how it evolved, and how it allows us to see, think, feel, laugh, interact, enjoy the arts, and ponder the mysteries of life. And he does it with the wit that prompted Mark Ridley to write in the New York Times Book Review, \"No other science writer makes me laugh so much. . . . [Pinker] deserves the superlatives that are lavished on him.\"  The arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates some unfashionable ideas, such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection, and challenges fashionable ones, such as that passionate emotions are irrational, that parents socialize their children, and that nature is good and modern society corrupting.

        "Title": "Java Message Service (O'Reilly Java Series)",
        "Authors": "By Monson-Haefel, Richard and Chappell, David A.",
        "Description": "This book is a thorough introduction to Java Message Service (JMS), the standard Java application program interface (API) from Sun Microsystems that supports the formal communication known as \"messaging\" between computers in a network. JMS provides a common interface to standard messaging protocols and to special messaging services in support of Java programs. The messages exchange crucial data between computers, rather than between users--information such as event notification and service requests. Messaging is often used to coordinate programs in dissimilar systems or written in different programming languages.Using the JMS interface, a programmer can invoke the messaging services of IBM's MQSeries, Progress Software's SonicMQ, and other popular messaging product vendors. In addition, JMS supports messages that contain serialized Java objects and messages that contain Extensible Markup Language (XML) pages.Messaging is a powerful new paradigm that makes it easier to uncouple different parts of an enterprise application. Messaging clients work by sending messages to a message server, which is responsible for delivering the messages to their destination. Message delivery is asynchronous, meaning that the client can continue working without waiting for the message to be delivered. The contents of the message can be anything from a simple text string to a serialized Java object or an XML document.Java Message Service shows how to build applications using the point-to-point and publish-and-subscribe models; how to use features like transactions and durable subscriptions to make an application reliable; and how to use messaging within Enterprise JavaBeans. It also introduces a new EJB type, the MessageDrivenBean, that is part of EJB 2.0, and discusses integration of messaging into J2EE.",

        "Description": "When we start with the wrong question, no matter how good an answer we get, it won\u2019t give us the results we want. Rather than joining the throngs who are asking, When will this economic crisis be over? Jim Wallis says the right question to ask is How will this crisis change us?  The worst thing we can do now, Wallis tells us, is to go back to normal. Normal is what got us into this situation. We need a new normal, and this economic crisis is an invitation to discover what that means. Some of the principles Wallis unpacks for our new normal are . . . \u2022 Spending money we don\u2019t have for things we don\u2019t need is a bad foundation for an economy or a family. \u2022 It\u2019s time to stop keeping up with the Joneses and start making sure the Joneses are okay. \u2022 The values of commercials and billboards are not the things we want to teach our children. \u2022 Care for the poor is not just a moral duty but is critical for the common good. \u2022 A healthy society is a balanced society in which markets, the government, and our communities all play a role. \u2022 The operating principle of God\u2019s economy says that there is enough if we share it. \u2022 And much, much more . . . In the pages of this book, Wallis provides us with a moral compass for this new economy\u2014one that will guide us on Wall Street, Main Street, and Your Street. Embracing a New Economy  Getting back to \"the way things were\" is not an option. It is time we take our economic uncertainty and use it to find some moral clarity. Too often we have been ruled by the maxims that greed is good, it\u2019s all about me, and I want it now. Those can be challenged only with some of our oldest and best values\u2014enough is enough, we are in it together, and thinking not just for tomorrow but for future generations.  Jim Wallis shows that the solution to our problems will be found only as individuals, families, friends, churches, mosques, synagogues, and entire communities wrestle with the question of values together.",

        "Authors": "By Kohlenberger, John R., III",
        "Description": "When you want to get a firm understanding of God's grace, where do you start? You could consult your concordance for every appearance of \"grace\" in the Bible. But what about those Scripture passages that don't use the word grace, yet are vital to understanding it? Reach for the NIV Compact Nave's Topical Bible. It broadens your scope beyond word-searches to topical studies. Now you're ready to deal not just with key words, but with concepts. Based on the award-winning Zondervan NIV Nave's Topical Bible, this compact edition omits biblical text while retaining virtually all of its topical muscle. All the entries are here, all the reference, all the definitions and notes. And like its full-sized counterpart, the NIV Compact Nave's Topical Bible improves on the original, King James Version-based Nave's Topical Bible by adding more than 500 headings, 2,000 subtopics, and 1,300 cross-references. You'll find entries addressing contemporary issues such as abuse, ecology, homosexuality, and abortion -- all keyed to the best-selling New International Version, and easily usable with translations as well. So when you're ready to dig deeper into the Scriptures, it's time to add this book to your library. Its thoroughness will bring new dimensions to your Bible studies, and its portable size makes it easy to use any time, anywhere. Keep the whole set within reach on your desktop. Grab a volume or two volumes and take them with you anywhere. Each NIV Compact book packs a lot of information in a small package \u2014 one that fits where other books won\u2019t and travels light when larger volumes tip the scales. And the price is as compact as the size \u2014 but don\u2019t let the modest cost fool you. There\u2019s a lot of knowledge here, condensed to provide the most salient information in an efficient format. For a hand-sized reference library that does more than scratch the surface, this 4-volume series is the route to take: big on insight, small in size, and easy on the pocketbook.",

Centered around a character study of John, the beloved apostle, it develops the tie between intimacy with God and the corresponding grace of hearing his voice. Being a prophetic generation, the author explains, is not so much about giftedness as it is about people who have spent intimate time with the Lord Jesus and declared faithfully what they have heard from the mouth of God. Ruthlessly yet graciously, Goll exposes common misconceptions from his own personal journey with prophetic ministry, as well as through the successes and failures of gifted people throughout church history. A great tool--more than instruction, but wisdom from the trenches--for pastors who grapple with the real-life issues of working with prophetic people. The Coming Prophetic Revolution casts the vision that will take us from a fragmented body of Christ to the great revolutionary army of God on earth.",
