        "Authors": "By Back, Kurt W.",
        "Description": "Sensitivity training, T-Groups, and encounter groups have become a way of life. Beyond Words traces the history of this movement, the background of its successes, its varieties, and its failures. Dr. Back's approach is neither one of wide-eyed admiration nor hostility. Instead, he has written a book that provides the first long, hard look at sensitivity training as a social phenomenon. From its fortuitous beginnings the movement is followed through its developments at Bethel, its growth across the country, its new centers in California, its spread to Europe. The novelty of this movement, an almost religious exercise based on the scientific ethos, is related to the peculiar conditions of the last quarter century. The movement has acquired its own mythos. Dr. Back examines the interplay of the conflicting aims of self-expression and change, and shows how these contradictory aims have affected the ramifications of the movement in theory, in management, in recreation, and in education. Results emerging from studies on effects of sensitivity training indicate a recurrent pattern of great immediate emphasis followed by little permanent beneficial effect. Finally, Beyond Words assesses the overall impact of the movement, its relation to science, its possible changes, and its portent as a symptom of the state of society. Dr. Back examines the interplay of the conflicting aims of self-expression and change, and shows how these contradictory aims have affected the ramifications of the movement in theory, in management, in recreation, and in education.",

Out of that experience cameRussia, a book that probed beneath the usual surface observations, stereotypes, and official rhetoric to present a subtle, multi-layered depiction of the tenor of the country behind the Soviet fa\u00e7ade. In 1989, Shipler returned to write an updated edition, retaining his focus on the durable features of Russian life and spirit, while taking into account the changes wrought by Gorbachev and glasnost at the end of the Cold War. The result is a memorable, incisive, and emininetly human portrait of the Russian people that remains as vital as ever amid increased tensions between Russia and the United States.",

With the aircraft exploding around him, O'Grady desperately grabbed his ejection handle and pulled. Five miles up and traveling at 350 miles per hour, O'Grady had escaped certain death. But his ordeal was just beginning.Return with Honor is the incredible true-life thriller of one man's fierce struggle to survive in the hostile territory of war-torn Bosnia, told in his own words. For six days and nights Scott O'Grady eluded the Bosnian Serbs who relentlessly hunted him. At times his pursuers stood five feet from his hiding places, guns at the ready, listening for the slightest sound. Yet O'Grady never gave in, relying on his survival training, cunning, and deep faith in God to evade capture and establish contact with the comrades-in-arms who could pull him out.Here, in never-before-revealed detail, is the amazing story of how O'Grady managed to live through a missile impact at 27,000 feet, the techniques he used to survive in a barren and hostile landscape, and the real story behind the daring daylight rescue mission carried out by the U.S. Marines.",

        "Description": "While walking through a cliff-top graveyard in the village of Morwenstow on the coast of Cornwall, the author encounters a wooden Scottish maiden trimmed with emblems and a shield. At first, Seal presumes the maiden is merely an elaborate headstone. But upon closer inspection, he realizes that the maiden, now a guardian for the graves she overlooks, was once the figurehead of a merchant ship. He learns that she adorned the Caledonia, a ship wrecked on the English coast in 1842, and that the crew had been benevolently buried there by the villagers. Further investigation leads Seal to suspect those villagers, and chiefly the village's parson, Robert Hawker, for the Caledonia's sudden demise. Though no one has ever been brought to court for \"wrecking\"--luring ships ashore to loot the cargo--it's a commonly held belief that this did take place. But, is that what happened in Morwenstow, a village cruelly perched above a jagged, inhospitable shore? Having meticulously researched maritime logs and burial registers, broadsides of the day, diary entries, and other first-hand documents, Seal weaves history, travelogue, and imaginative narrative into this marvelous piece of detective work, bringing us a mystery of the best kind--the sort that really did happen.",

But as he sifts the evidence and comes across old photographs of the victim's earlier life in Tangier after the war, he finds that he too is dragged back into the past. Falc\u00f3n himself had been brought up in Tangier. His father had become famous there. A Spanish artist of world reknown, Fransisco Falc\u00f3n, had died recently leaving a large inheritance and a set of journals which his son starts reading.

        "Description": "A first novel by an acclaimed American poet, House Under Snow is a story of mothers and daughters, of sexual identity, of a family slowly disintegrating after the premature death of its patriarch. Anna Crane, soon to be married, reflects back on her childhood in Ohio during the 1960s and '70s with her two sisters and Lilly, her charismatic, self-destructing mother. Lilly is endlessly consumed by memories of her late husband and spends her days dreamily creating paper menageries or preparing for dates with a stream of suitors. Evoking the claustrophobia of small-town life, Anna's first passionate love affair with a troubled boy who works as a groom and trainer at a horse track and she and her sisters struggle toward adulthood, the novel races toward a chilling conclusion when Anna is betrayed by the two most important figures in her young life.   Not since Alice McDermott's That Night has there been such a telling portrait of first love. And not since Mona Simpson's Anywhere But Here have we witnessed the destructive, seductive nature of a mother who insists on competing with her children. Illuminating the price of loss and survival, House Under Snow is an unforgettable and brilliantly told debut accomplishment.",

In London, Brigadier Charles Ferguson, head of the prime minister's personal action unit, has learned of the existence of a copy of the mysterious Chungking Covenant. This document, long thought lost, was signed in China in 1944 by Mao and by Lord Mountbatten on behalf of Winston Churchill. In return for arms and assistance in his war with the Japanese, Mao agreed to extend the Hong Kong Treaty by one hundred years if he ever came to power in China.Halfway around the world, sinister Hong Kong business interests have also learned of the newly discovered document. If the Chungking Covenant were to become public, the delicate balance of power among the Chinese, British, and Americans would be destroyed. Dillon and Ferguson, on direct orders from the prime minister, must stop the document from coming to light at all costs. The story accelerates with deadly momentum, climaxing in a shocking display of violence at the Scottish castle of a mysterious American billionaire, a castle known as Loch Dhu, or \"Place of Dark Waters.\"On Dangerous Ground is a virtuoso performance.

War, deadly viruses, economic upheaval, and mass destruction fill the newspaper headlines and have many questioning if these are the signs of the approaching Armageddon. Paul Crouch, minister, television personality, and founder of Trinity Broadcasting Network, provides answers as he reveals the shattering truths found in the hidden prophecies of the Bible. Many prophecies concerning our modern era were precisely foretold throughout various portions of the Holy Scriptures, and many others are yet to come. However, the most overwhelming and fearful Last-Day prophecies are beginning to cast their shadows on an unsuspecting world.  As the Bible gives a vivid and detailed analysis of the past, present, and future of all things, it also acts as a spiritual map for precise direction and clear understanding of what life is all about. In spite of all the dark and frightening events that seem to point to the end of the world, the Bible also promises that a Blessed Hope is waiting to reveal Himself, that there is Pure Light at the end of the tunnel. Paul Crouch offers an opportunity to find meaning in current world events and reminds us that everything ultimately leads to the Second Coming. His practical and lifesaving insights provide the chance to make life-changing decisions as the End Times approach.  In the tradition of The Late Great Planet Earth, The Shadow of the Apocalypse is timely, alarming, and yet ultimately filled with great hope. It is an urgent and inspirational clarion call to people all over the world.",

You'll read about the curiosities and cons of the most notorious hornswogglers and flimflam men of the nineteenth century; you'll be astounded at the impostors, pretenders, carnies, and tricksters of the twentieth.  Learn how Edgar Allan Poe got away with an astonishing literary deception. Or how P. T. Barnum turned hoaxing the public into big business. It's all here, from the origin of April Fools' Day to the Taco Liberty Bell, from Bigfoot to the War of the Worlds to recent Internet hoaxes. There's also a Gullibility Test that challenges readers to answer the question: \"Would these hoaxes have fooled YOU?\"  Written with both humor and historical insight, and complete with photographs and illustrations, The Museum of Hoaxes will be the gift book of choice for anyone who has ever been duped, deceived, tricked, or trumped . . . or just likes watching the pros in action.",

        "Description": "Readers may be shocked to discover that America's most provocative (and conservative) satirist, P. J. O'Rourke, was at one time a raving pinko, with scars on his formerly bleeding heart to prove it. In Age and Guile Beat Youth, Innocence, and a Bad Haircut, O'Rourke chronicles the remarkable trajectory that took him from the lighthearted fun of the revolutionary barricades to the serious business of the nineteenth hole. How did the O'Rourke of 1970, who summarized the world of \"grown-ups\" as \"materialism, sexual hang-ups, the Republican party, uncomfortable clothes, engagement rings, car accidents, Pat Boone, competition, patriotism, cheating, lying, ranch houses, and TV\" come to be in favor of all of those things? What causes a beatnik-hippie type, comfortable sleeping on dirty mattresses in pot-addled communes - as P. J. did when he was a writer for assorted \"underground\" papers-to metamorphosize into a right-wing middle-aged grouch? Here, P. J. shows how his Socialist idealism and avant-garde aesthetic tendencies were cured and how he acquired a healthy and commendable interest in national defense, the balanced budget, Porsches, and Cohiba cigars. P. J. O'Rourke's message is that there's hope for all those suffering from acute Bohemianism, or as he puts it, \"Pull your pants up, turn your hat around, and get a job.\" \"From the fictionalized accounts of his career as a hard-drinking hippie to the Benchley-in-the-age-of-macho lampoon of fly fishing, Mr. O'Rourke shows an incorrigible comic gift and an eye for detail that keeps the wild stuff grounded.\" - The New York Times Book Review",

        "Authors": "By Johnston, David C.",
        "Description": "Now updated with a new prologue!\u00a0Since the mid-1970s, there has been a dramatic shift in America's socioeconomic system, one that has gone virtually unnoticed by the general public. Tax policies and their enforcement have become a disaster, and thanks to discreet lobbying by a segment of the top 1 percent, Washington is reluctant or unable to fix them. The corporate income tax, the estate tax, and the gift tax  have been largely ignored by the media. But the cumulative results are remarkable: today someone who earns a yearly salary of $60,000 pays a larger percentage of his income in taxes than the four hundred richest Americans.Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter David Cay Johnston exposes exactly how the middle class is being squeezed to create a widening wealth gap that threatens the stability of the country. By relating the compelling tales of real people across all areas of society, he reveals the truth behind:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\"Middle class\" tax cuts and exactly whom they benefit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How workers are being cheated out of their retirement plans while disgraced CEOs walk away with millions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How some corporations avoid paying any federal income tax.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How a law meant to prevent cheating by the top 2 percent of Americans no longer affects most of them, but has morphed into a stealth tax on single mothers making just $28,000.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Why the working poor are seven times more likely to be audited by the IRS than everyone else.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How the IRS became so weak that even when it was handed complete banking records detailing massive cheating by 1,600 people, it prosecuted only 4 percent of them.Johnston has been breaking pieces of this story on the front page of The New York Times for seven years. With Perfectly Legal, he puts the whole shocking narrative together in a way that will stir up media attention and make readers angry about the state of our country.",

        "Description": "With each new novel, Anne Perry adds striking dimensions to the architecture of her fiction, building with inspired imagination a many-layered world of rich and poor, nobility and degradation. \"She lifts the lace curtain from Victorian society,\" Sharyn McCrumb has said, \"to reveal its shocking secrets.\" Like her last William Monk novel, this one brilliantly evokes England's nineteenth-century legal justice system and builds to a heart-stopping courtroom drama.In a sunny garden, in a pleasant London suburb, a young woman is brutally raped. In a London hospital, another young woman, a talented nurse who had been one of Florence Nightingale's angels of mercy in the Crimean War, meets a sudden, fearful death by strangulation.William Monk, no longer a policeman but a private inquiry agent, is engaged to investigate these horrific crimes. The first is readily, if tragically, resolved. The murder of Nurse Prudence Barrymore, however, presents greater difficulties. Even the victim's mother agrees that a rebellious young woman who flouts the traditional roles of marriage and motherhood to work in a filthy hospital must expect a bad end. In the brutal squalor of a Victorian hospital, death in any shape, even murder, can be no surprise.But Monk's intuition tells him that Prudence Barrymore's murder is no random stroke of violence by a madman.Greatly helped by Hester Latterly, a nurse who knew Prudence on the battlefield, Monk assembles the portrait of a remarkable woman. He also discerns the shadow of a tragic evil that darkens every level of society, and a frightening glimmer of his own eclipsed past. It all leads Monk, and the reader, to a denouement that ranks with Anne Perry's best, as a packed audience waits breathlessly in the Old Bailey for the outcome of a sensational trial.",
