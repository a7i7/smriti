The Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest presents the very best of what people are cooking today for their family and friends - for everyday dinners, special occasion desserts and mouthwatering breads. Now, for the very first time, more than 350 of the most sought after prize-winning recipes from this famed cooking contest are gathered in one book, complete with gorgeous color photographs and stories about the people and the inspiration that led to their award-winning recipes.Best of the Bake-Off Cookbook is a sweet and savory record of how American cooking has evolved over the years, illustrating how home cooks have captured their ethnic heritages in dishes adapted from their grandparents' countries to modern kitchens and busier times. The stories are as inspiring as the recipes themselves, from 1955 winner Rosemary Sport's prize - a new pink range - which provided her family with the motivation to become proud new homeowners to 1996's Grand Prize-winner, Kurt Wait, a single parent, who with the help of his son developed his $1,000,000-winning recipe Macadamia Fudge Torte.Hundreds of the very best recipes are accompanied by enticing color photographs and organized by category: Soups, Sandwiches and Snacks; Main Dishes; Side Dishes and Salads; Breads; Sweet Rolls and Coffee Cakes; Cookies and Bars; Cakes and Tortes; Pies and Tarts; and Other Desserts. Each chapter is filled with personal profiles highlighting the people who created the recipes plus the wonderful and oftentimes humorous behind-the-scenes stories from the Bake-Off Contest events: One contestant accidentally sat on her cake entry; another was notified that she was a lucky contestant via a citizens-band message broadcast by her town's postmistress.",

American GIs pour into Father Darragh's neighborhood, and with them comes a reminder of the atrocities abounding nearby. Determined to shun hypocrisy, the earnest priest finds himself constantly at odds with his superiors, who frown on his efforts to rescue an errant black soldier and pay deathbed visits to the wayward. But Frank Darragh persists, becoming his parish's most popular confessor, particularly among wives of Australian servicemen who confront an array of temptations while their husbands are away.One such parishioner, Kate Heggarty, turns the tables of temptation on young Darragh, challenging his spiritual beliefs and stirring a vulnerable place in his heart. When Kate is found murdered, his anguish is only compounded by accusations that he caused her death. Poignantly depicting the conflicts between the secular and the holy and between the family of Darragh's birth and the brotherhood of priests, Office of Innocence is a tale set in the most compelling of circumstances. Drawing on his own experience studying for the priesthood in his youth, Thomas Keneally has created a protagonist who speaks to the conundrums of our age while paying tribute to quiet heroes of the past.",

        "Description": "Part love story, part murder mystery, set on the cusp of the Second World War, Russell Banks's sharp-witted and deeply engaging new novel raises dangerous questions about class, politics, art, love, and madness\u2014and explores what happens when two powerful personalities, trapped at opposite ends of a social divide, begin to break the rules.Twenty-nine-year-old Vanessa Cole is a wild, stunningly beautiful heiress, the adopted only child of a highly regarded New York brain surgeon and his socialite wife. Twice married, Vanessa has been scandalously linked to any number of rich and famous men. But on the night of July 4, 1936, at her parents' country home in a remote Adirondack Mountain enclave known as The Reserve, two events coincide to permanently alter the course of Vanessa's callow life: her father dies suddenly of a heart attack, and a mysteriously seductive local artist, Jordan Groves, blithely lands his Waco biplane in the pristine waters of the forbidden Upper Lake. . . .Jordan's reputation has preceded him; he is internationally known as much for his exploits and conquests as for his paintings themselves, and, here in the midst of the Great Depression, his leftist loyalties seem suspiciously undercut by his wealth and elite clientele. But for all his worldly swagger, Jordan is as staggered by Vanessa's beauty and charm as she is by his defiant independence. He falls easy prey to her electrifying personality, but it is not long before he discovers that the heiress carries a dark, deeply scarring family secret. Emotionally unstable from the start, and further unhinged by her father's unexpected death, Vanessa begins to spin wildly out of control, manipulating and destroying the lives of all who cross her path.Moving from the secluded beauty of the Adirondack wilderness to the skies above war-torn Spain and Fascist Germany, The Reserve is a clever, incisive, and passionately romantic novel of suspense that adds a new dimension to this acclaimed author's extraordinary repertoire.",

At the height of his career, a British surgeon has found success in both the hospital and at home. He and his wife have everything they want out of life, except the child she longs for, the child Dr. Woodruff secretly believes he may never be ready to parent. Suddenly, the delicate equilibrium of their relationship is blown apart by the arrival of shocking news. Deep in the desolate sub-Arctic wilderness of Canada where Woodruff lived and worked years before, a woman claims he is the father of her thirteen-year-old twins. Woodruff knows it cannot be true -- but DNA tests don't lie.To make sense of the impossible, he must return to that frozen wilderness, where no rules and few laws apply. Leaving his shattered relationship behind, he finds that his well-guarded secrets have even deeper and more sinister layers. But the people he once knew in that godforsaken place guard secrets of their own, and no one -- least of all the ruthless woman at the dark core of this maelstrom -- will help him uncover the truth. The past quickly gains a stranglehold, threatening to unravel everything Woodruff has built -- his marriage, his career. And a man who has made one mistake may pay dearly for another -- and risk destroying his entire future....

        "Title": "The Most Democratic Branch: How the Courts Serve America (Institutions of American Democracy)",
        "Authors": "By Rosen, Jeffrey",
        "Description": "Many critics attack federal judges as anti-democratic elitists, activists out of step with the mainstream of American thought. But others argue that judges should stand alone as the ultimate guardians of American values, placing principle before the views of the people. In The Most Democratic Branch, Jeffrey Rosen disagrees with both assertions. Contrary to what interest groups may claim, he contends that, from the days of John Marshall right up to the present, the federal courts by and largehave reflected the opinions of the mainstream. More important, he argues that the Supreme Court is most successful when it defers to the constitutional views of the American people, as represented most notably by Congress and the Presidency. And on the rare occasion when they departed from the consensus, the result has often been a disaster.To illustrate, Rosen provides a penetrating look at some of the most important Supreme Court cases in American history--cases involving racial equality, affirmative action, abortion, gay rights and gay marriage, the right to die, electoral disputes, and civil liberties in wartime. Rosen shows that the most notorious constitutional decisions in American history--the ones that have been most strenuously criticized, such asDred Scott or Roe v. Wade--have gone against mainstream opinion. By contrast, the most successful decisions--fromMarbury v. Madison to Brown v. Board of Education--have avoided imposing constitutional principles over the wishes of the people. Rosen concludes that the judiciary works best when it identifies the constitutional principles accepted by a majority of Americans, and enforces them unequivocally as fundamental law. Jeffrey Rosen is one of the most respected legal experts writing today, a regular contributor toThe New York Times Magazine and the Legal Affairs Editor of The New Republic. The provocative arguments that he puts forth here are bound to fuel heated debate at a time when the federal judiciary is already the focus of fierce criticism.",

The main strategy behind it involves using the latest in conservation science along with the desires of local communities to protect the places where people live and work. In this way, each small success moves conservationists closer toward creating huge protected landscapes large enough to support animals like bison and wolves. Only with freedom to roam through and between these lands, using wilderness corridors, can such large animals flourish.Adams provides numerous examples of how this new conservation is succeeding around the country: cooperative ranchers work together to preserve wilderness in Arizona; activists fight the encroachment of big business on the Florida Everglades; and a maverick scientist struggles to create safe passageways for pumas in California\u2019s overpopulated Orange County. Each example proves the benefits of combining the latest scientific studies with practical community organizing and sound economic planning. Through these examples and important conservation history, Adams shows how we can realistically protect wildlands despite our growing numbers.The Future of the Wild is a much needed, accessible book full of fascinating stories, unforgettable characters, and, ultimately, a powerful new vision for conservation in America.\u201cAdams profiles ecologists and activists, as well as grassroots and national conservation organizations, in a seamless flow of readable prose to make his point that sustainable human activity and sustainable populations of wildlife must not be mutually exclusive.\u201d \u2014Ted Levin, OnEarth\u201cAn engaging, well-written book with a real feel for wildlife, wild places and the fascinating cast of characters\u2014scientists, environmentalists and ranchers\u2014whose idealism and dedication are contributing to a radically different kind of conservation.\u201d \u2014Paul Evans, BBC Wildlife\u201cJonathan Adams lays out a bold road map for how to bind together the scattered remnants of this continent\u2019s wild places\u2014and for knitting up the mingled fates of the wild and human communities that inhabit them, envisioning a better, more sustainable future for both.\u201d \u2014Scott Weidensaul, author of Return to Wild AmericaJonathan S.

        "Description": "From two of America\u2019s most prominent and accomplished journalists, an impassioned investigation of an endangered species, good journalism.Leonard Downie Jr. and Robert G. Kaiser\u2014both reporters and editors at the Washington Post for nearly four decades\u2014take us inside the American news media to reveal why the journalism we watch and read is so often so bad, and to explain what can be done about it.They demonstrate how the media\u2019s preoccupation with celebrities, entertainment, sensationalism and profits can make a mockery of news. They remind us of the value of serious journalism with inside accounts of how great stories were reported and written\u2014a New York Times investigation of Scientology and the IRS, and a Washington Post expos\u00e9 of police excesses. They recount a tense debate inside their own newsroom about whether to publicize a presidential candidate\u2019s long-ago love affair. They also provide surprisingly candid interviews with Dan Rather, Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw. The authors explain why local television news is so uninformative. They evaluate news on the Internet, noting how unreliable it can be, and why it is so important to the future of the news business.Coverage of the terrorist attacks on America in the fall of 2001 demonstrated that the news media can still do outstanding work, Downie and Kaiser write, but that does not guarantee a bright future for news. Their book makes exceedingly clear why serious, incorruptible, revelatory reporting is crucial to the health of American society if we are to be informed, equipped to make decisions and protected from the abuse of power. And it allows all of us to feel like insiders in one of America\u2019s most powerful institutions, the media.",

For in vice-ridden Whitechapel, three female paupers of dubious morals have been murdered, their bodies hideously defiled. And in taunting letters their killer announces his intention to strike again\u2014and signs his name \"Jack the Ripper.\"As conceived by the award-winning mystery writer Michael Dibdin, The Last Sherlock Holmes Story is a brilliantly inventive updating of the Holmes legend. Pitting master detective against archfiend, steely rationalism against satanic depravity, Dibdin gives us a Holmes who is more complex, more human, and ultimately more fascinating than the one imagined by Arthur Conan Doyle. Here is a riveting combination of history and fiction that confirms Dibdin's reputation as one of the most imaginative and atmospheric crime writers now at work.",

It's almost five o'clock. Where the hell are you?  Losing Julia has become a constant in Cindy Carver's life. The first time Julia disappeared, she was five years old and vanished at the playground. That inspired motherly paranoia. The second was when, at age fourteen, Julia decided to move in with her father. That broke Cindy's heart. But when twenty-one-year-old Julia disappears without a trace after a promising audition with one of Hollywood's most powerful and influential directors, Cindy begins a frantic search. Secrets are revealed, lives are forever altered, and Cindy is forced to acknowledge the disturbing truth about the young woman she realizes she never really knew.

A man with plenty of secrets, he won\u2019t tell her anything, much less let her help, and she isn\u2019t having any more luck with her old friends at the Boston PD.

        "Description": "Innovative, original ideas are a company&apos;s most powerful competitive advantage. Nathan Mhyrvold, former chief technology officer at Microsoft, has said that a great employee is worth 1,000 times more than an average one simply because of his or her ideas. In Ideaship, the sequel to his bestselling book, How to Get Ideas, Jack Foster shifts from how individuals spark their new ideas to how to unleash the creative genius of an entire organization. To create an idea-prone workforce, Foster proposes a totally new concept of leadership: \"ideaship.\" Leaders shouldn&apos;t be spending their time obsessing over profits or sales or quality or service. Instead, they should devote most of their energies to making the office a place where creative ideas flow, where the workforce truly believes in its ability to brilliantly solve any problem put before it. Above all, where it&apos;s fun to work. With energy and humor, Foster draws on over thirty-five years as creative director of major advertising agencies-organizations whose only purpose is to constantly generate ideas-to offer dozens of fun, fast, often surprising nuggets of practical advice on how to create an environment where innovation and fresh thinking thrive. He reveals why you should only hire people you like, insist employees take vacations whether they want to or not, why efficiency is sometimes inefficient, and how sometimes you can accomplish more by playing the fool instead of the capital L \"Leader.\" Ideaship spells out proven ways to encourage creativity, simply and clearly and cogently, without a lot of charts and graphs and formulas and acronyms and statistics and fillers. It flips traditional leadership on its head and shows how simple acts of compassion, trust, and generosity of spirit, as well as some seemingly zany actions, can unleash unexpected, vital bursts of creativity.",

        "Description": "What's the best way for you to find out what a prospective customer needs? Ask! It sounds simple enough, but many salespeople get so tangled up in nerves, benefits-hawking and making a \"pitch\" that they forget to ask customers questions - or to ask them the right questions. This quick-to-read guide offers precise guidance on asking prospects appropriate and effective sales questions. You'll learn how to formulate questions that generate meaningful dialogue and uncover opportunities; channel a prospect from an opportunity to a sale; determine a client's true motivation; pace a conversation, gain and keep client interest, and maintain control of the conversation; present solutions; and deal with a prospect who won't \"follow the script\"",

The Iranian-American Sami and Ziba Yazdan, with Ziba's elegant and reserved mother, Maryam, in tow, wait quietly while brash and all-American Bitsy and Brad Donaldson, plus extended family, are armed with camcorders and a fleet of balloons proclaiming \"It's a girl!\" After they decide together to throw an impromptu \"arrival party,\" a tradition is born, and so begins a lifelong friendship between the two families. As they raise their daughters, the Yazdan and Donaldson families grapple with questions of assimilation and identity. When Bitsy's recently widowed father sets his sights on Maryam, she must confront her own idea of what it means to be other, and of who she is and what she values.",

Dateable pulls no punches in telling teens the truth about dating while also directing their passion toward a greater purpose in life.  Teen relationships seldom last, the authors point out, so why should teens invest so much of themselves emotionally, physically, and spiritually? The answer? They shouldn't. Instead, they can protect their hearts, live with excitement, and enjoy relationships in a way that enhances rather than detracts from those they'll have in the future. With Justin and Hayley \"telling it like it is,\" teens will learn how to be dateable and how to evaluate the dateability of their latest crush. And they'll get some much-needed perspective on sex, his/her communication, clothes, God-even \"chick flicks.\" Dateable also includes sidebars, quizzes, callouts, and more.",

        "Authors": "By Rendell, Ruth",
        "Description": "At first there was no reason to link the killings. The first one, months earlier, seemed totally random: a lump of concrete pushed off an overpass onto a passing car. By contrast, the gruesome bludgeoning death of Amber Marshalson, returning home late from a night out clubbing with friends, was obviously calculated. The killer had been seen waiting for the girl in a nearby wood. But when Chief Inspector Wexford discovers that Amber had been the driver right behind the crushed car\u2014and that she\u2019d been driving a silver Honda, while the car in front of her was a gray Honda\u2014he knows that someone wanted the teenager dead badly enough to kill twice to get the job done. And as it turns out, this murderer\u2019s plans are only just getting underway. Can Wexford unravel the complex knots that connect these murders in time to save future victims? Or is he, as he begins to fear, losing his touch and fast becoming a relic of another time?Long beloved by readers for her deft weaving of wonderfully meticulous characterization, dark humor, and trenchant social commentary into gripping and fast-paced plots, Ruth Rendell is in top form with End in Tears. Taking off from the first page with back-to-back murders and ending with one of Wexford\u2019s own officers in mortal danger, End in Tears touches on issues of class, race, parenthood, aging, and gender roles as it brings the traditional British whodunit into the twenty-first century.Also available as a Random House AudioBook, Large Print edition, and eBook",

A raw document crafted from diaries, notebooks, and letters, this deeply personal yet universally appealing story astonishes with its candor. Young Margaret moves with ease between the seemingly trivial concerns of hairstyles and boys to more profound questions of faith and meaning. By turns funny and poignant, heartbreaking and profound, she tackles all of the decade's issues--desegregation, drugs, the sexual revolution, the rise of feminism, and the spread of charismatic evangelical Christianity--with humor, frankness, and unexpected insight.Miss American Pie reminds us what it feels like to grow up, offering a true and honest look at a teenager grappling with the timeless questions of sex, friendship, God, love, loss, and the meaning of family. The introduction and epilogue, written by Sartor from an older perspective, reflect on those turbulent and life-shaping years, revealing how the girl in the diary turned out after all, and demonstrating that childhood--both its joys and traumas--reverberate deeply in our adult lives.",
