        "Title": "From Botswana to the Bering Sea: My Thirty Years With National Geographic",
        "Authors": "By Canby, Thomas Y.",
        "Description": "National Geographic has been called a window on the world and a passport to adventure. Each month an estimated forty million people in 190 countries open its pages and are transported to exotic realms that delight the eye and mind. Such widespread renown gives the magazine&#39;s writers an almost magical access to people and happenings, as doors that are closed to the rest of the journalistic world open wide.Thomas Y. Canby was fortunate to be a NationalGeographic writer and science editor from 1961 to 1991, a time during which the Society&#39;s ventures and size grew by leaps and bounds and the resources available to staff were seemingly limitless. In From Botswana to the Bering Sea, he gives readers an on-the-ground look at the life of a National Geographic field staffer and an insider&#39;s view of the fascinating dynamics within the magazine&#39;s editorial chambers.Canby&#39;s assignments dealt largely with issues of global concern, and his travels took him to the farthest reaches of the planet. This book gives the reader the visas and tickets to share in Canby&#39;s experiences -- from a Filipino rice harvest capped by a feast of deep-fried rats, to impoverished villages of Asia and Africa gripped by the world&#39;s most widespread famine, to seal hunting and dog sledding with Eskimos in the Canadian high Arctic. Readers match wits with paranoid guardians of the secret Soviet space program; skirt land mines in the flaming oil fields of Kuwait; and dodge death while scuba diving to an archaeological site in a Florida sinkhole. The book also gives insight into the magazine&#39;s inner workings: how article subjects are chosen; how writers are assigned and interact; how prolonged trips to impossibly remote destinations are planned; how staffers operate in the field.Working for National Geographic has been called \"the best job in the world.\" From Botswana to the Bering Sea describes that unique job, and answers from first-hand knowledge the question Canby and his colleagues are so often asked: \"So, what is it like to work for National Geographic?\"",

        "Title": "View from the Eye of the Storm: Terror and Reason in the Middle East",
        "Authors": "By Harari, Haim",
        "Description": "In 2004, internationally known physicist Haim Harari was invited to address the advisory board of a major multinational corporation. In a short speech he offered a penetrating analysis of the components of terror, and presented a passionate call for a new era in the Middle East. The speech, entitled \"A View from the Eye of the Storm,\" was not intended for publication, but when a copy was leaked and posted onto the Internet, it caused a worldwide sensation, eventually being translated into more than half a dozen languages. Now\u2014as the modern era of Islamic terror continues to unfold\u2014Harari reaches further, to offer this serious yet accessible survey of the landscape of Middle Eastern war and peace at this challenging crossroads in history.Moving beyond the sterile discourse of foreign affairs journals, Harari encourages the world to view the Middle East through the eyes of a \"proverbial taxi driver,\" a man on the street whose wisdom (and sense of humor) outstrips that of the experts. And, as he observes, to anyone familiar with the Middle East from a taxi driver's perspective, the \"persistent ugly storm\" engulfing the Arab world is far more than a territorial battle with Israel: It is an \"undeclared World War III\" that rages from Bali to Madrid, from Nairobi to New York, from Buenos Aires to Istanbul, and from Tunis to Moscow. The sad result is that much of the Arab world has become an \"unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators, terror networks, fanaticism, incitement, suicide murders, and general decline.\" And unless the free nations of the world mobilize to stop it, Harari argues, this new world war will continue to cause bloodshed on all continents.As a fifth-generation Israeli-born observer, Harari includes a thorough response to the conventional wisdom about Middle Eastern affairs, including a frank dissection of the media's lopsided portrait of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Drawing on his family's two centuries of life in the Middle East, he offers a compelling catalog of the steps necessary to reach a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians\u2014steps, he writes, that are \"inevitable\u2014not because everybody accepts them today, but because all sides must accept them before peace can be achieved.\" And he urges the civilized world to combat terror by isolating its state sponsors, blocking its funding, and promoting education, women's equality, and human rights reform.Eloquent in its simplicity, written with passion, humor, and the directness of a scientist who has spent a lifetime explaining his work to the general public, A View from the Eye of the Storm is that rare book with the power to change hearts and minds.",

When goat smugglers offered him safe passage to Yemen, he buried seven years' worth of travel journals deep in the sand and took his place alongside the animals on a leaky boat bound for a country that he'd never planned to visit.As he tells of the turbulent seas that stranded him on the island and of his efforts to retrieve his buried journals when he returned to Yemen ten years later, Hansen enthralls us with a portrait -- uncannily sympathetic and wildly offbeat -- of this forgotten corner of the Middle East. With a host of extraordinary characters from his guide, Mohammed, ever on the lookout for one more sheep to squeeze into the back seat of his car, to madcap expatriates and Eritrean gun runners- and with landscapes that include cities of dreamlike architectural splendor, endless sand dunes, and terrifying mountain passes, Hansen reveals the indelible allure of a land steeped in custom, conflicts old and new, and uncommon beauty.",

Julian has solved high profile murder cases, and been promoted to Lieutenant upstate Troy, New York. But her latest case has her baffled. She's tracking the killer of a respected husband and father. With no suspects, a family hungry for answers, and the press breathing down her neck, Julian is desperate and in over her head. That's when Julian gets an unlikely visitor: her one time mentor and the first man she arrested for murder, former police Chief Winston \"The Bear\" Edwards. Once famed for his physical immensity and unmatched detective skills, Edwards is now a shadow of his former self. He's managed to escape a life in prison, but emerged a beaten man with no family and nowhere to turn. The only thing he has left is his brilliant police mind. Now the one time mentor has returned to his former student, looking for a shot at redemption, and a reason for living. Despite Julian's mistrust and fear of Edwards, the young Lieutenant knows he's still a gifted detective and cautiously brings him in on this seemingly unsolvable case. Working side by side with a man who once tried to kill her, Julian gets drawn deep into the murder investigation-and into the mind of the murder victim's young daughter. The girl forces Julian to confront once again the bizarre events surrounding the decade old murder of her own father. Taut, edgy and utterly unpredictable, The Heat of Lies will shock and scare you and keep you turning the pages long into the night. Jonathan Stone is widely praised as one of today's top thriller writers. Stone knows the importance of character, the significance of nuance, and folly of clich\u00e9. This is his second, and most riveting novel.",

        "Description": "The tempestuous, bloody, and splendid reign of Henry VIII of England (1509-1547) is one of the most fascinating in all history, not least for his marriage to six extraordinary women. In this accessible work of brilliant scholarship, Alison Weir draws on early biographies, letters, memoirs, account books, and diplomatic reports to bring these women to life. Catherine of Aragon emerges as a staunch though misguided woman of principle; Anne Boleyn, an ambitious adventuress with a penchant for vengeance; Jane Seymour, a strong-minded matriarch in the making; Anne of Cleves, a good-natured and innocent woman naively unaware of the court intrigues that determined her fate; Catherine Howard, an empty-headed wanton; and Catherine Parr, a warm-blooded bluestocking who survived King Henry to marry a fourth time.",

For Ky, it's no contest: Even running the prestigious Vatta Transport Ltd. shipping concern can't hold a candle to shipping out as an officer aboard an interstellar cruiser. It's adventure, not commerce, that stirs her soul. And despite her family's misgivings, there can be no doubt that a Vatta in the service will prove a valuable asset. But with a single error in judgment, it all comes crumbling down.Expelled from the Academy in disgrace - and returning home to her humiliated family, a storm of high-profile media coverage, and the gaping void of her own future - Ky is ready to face the inevitable onslaught of anger, disappointment, even pity. But soon after opportunity's door slams shut, Ky finds herself with a ticket to ride - and a shot at redemption - as captain of a Vatta Transport ship.It's a simple assignment: escorting one of the Vatta fleet's oldest ships on its final voyage...to the scrapyard. But keeping it simple has never been Ky's style. And even though her father has provided a crew of seasoned veterans to baby-sit the fledgling captain on her maiden milk run, they can't stop Ky from turning the routine mission into a risky venture - in the name of turning a profit for Vatta Transport, of course.By snapping up a lucrative delivery contract defaulted on by a rival company, and using part of the proceeds to upgrade her condemned vehicle, Ky aims to prove she's got more going for her than just her family's famous name. But business will soon have to take a backseat to bravery, when Ky's change of plans sails her and the crew straight into the middle of a colonial war. For all her commercial savvy, it's her military training and born-soldier's instincts that Ky will need to call on in the face of deadly combat, dangerous mercenaries, and violent mutiny.",

        "Title": "Beastly Behaviors: A Zoo Lover's Companion: What Makes Whales Whistle, Cranes Dance, Pandas Turn Somersaults, and Crocodiles Roar: A Watcher's Guide to How Animals Act and Why",
        "Authors": "By Benyus, Janine M. and Barberis, Juan Carlos",
        "Description": "Beastly Behaviors is a book for animal lovers everywhere - a lively, illustrated armchair \"field guide\" to the behavior and body language of the world's most watchable zoo animals, arranged just the way exhibits are set up at the zoo: Animals of the African jungles, plains, and waterways; Asian forests; the warm oceans; North America; the Poles.In the friendly tone of a knowledgeable zookeeper, Janine Benyus answers questions about specific animals (like \"Why does the gorilla beat its chest?\") as well as questions that could apply to many animals (like \"How does each mother know her own young?\"). Drawing from the extensive research of animal behaviorists, she tells why and how these watchable critters scratch, rub, preen, bathe, stretch and yawn, eat and play, confront each other and court their mates, give birth to young and keep them fed - behaviors that are observable at your local zoo.Beastly Behaviors can be used in any zoo or wild animal park, on safari, on camping trips, on hikes, or even at home while watching wildlife shows on TV. But most of all, it's for browsing before and after - or instead of - a visit to the zoo. Above all, Beastly Behaviors is engaging; like Kipling's The Elephant's Child it is for all those who want to know where the elephant got its trunk, but require a more reliable answer than a \"Just-So\" story.A book for all ages.",

        "Authors": "By Oestreicher, Mark",
        "Description": "Ready to introduce your junior highers to wild examples of spiritual maturity? Check out biblical adventures of these people and the character qualities they exemplify -- real people who, in wild Bible stories, did really wild things for God: - Kid King . . . Josiah (influencing others)  - Wise Guy, the King of Good Decisions . . . Solomon (wise decisions)  - Little Timmy, the Teenage Teacher . . . Timothy (living for God while still a young teen)  - Dave's posse . . . David's mighty men (doing outrageous things for God)  - Whiney Bro, the Fair-Share Demander . . . the Prodigal Son's brother (demanding your rights)  - Moe's Mom, the Cruise Director . . . Moses' mother (trusting God in difficult situations)  - Pete, the Second-Chance Wonder . . . Peter (God's forgiveness)  - Samantha, the Water Woman . . . the woman at the well (racism).  You won't believe all the off-the-wall discussion starters, video ideas, scripts, games with a point -- and, of course, Bible passages you can use to springboard junior highers into topics that don't just mean the world to them, but are the world. Friendship. Embarrassment. Rights. Racism. Each lesson reaches back into history to underline for junior highers the reality of Old and New Testament people and principles -- and then reaches forward, challenging your students to make better decisions, better friends, better lives. Each lesson thoroughly preps you to teach it, including convenient reminders of what materials you need and when you need them. And in each lesson students dig into Wild Pages that bring scriptural principles right into the kids' own experience.  12 lessons",
