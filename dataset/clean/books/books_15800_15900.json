His weekly television program, which speaks powerfully to people from every background and walk of life, has become enormously popular in Israel. Offering creative and passionate insights into timeless Biblical and other wisdom traditions, spiritual teacher Gafni has become an inspirational force for unity and personal growth abroad; now, his universal message comes to America, fully realized, in his first book.  Marc Gafni follows in the tradition of M. Scott Peck and Ram Dass, bringing compassion and wisdom to everyday experience. Addressing our age-old desire to feel connected, he uses spiritual stories to teach us how to live fuller, happier lives. The secret is to \"live your story,\" and we do this by identifying our true, unique selves -- what he calls our \"soul prints.\" Only then can we connect on a far deeper level with the world and with those sharing it alongside us.  While based in the realm of spirituality and philosophy, Soul Prints speaks to all readers, regardless of religious beliefs or practices -- or lack thereof. Using the power of myth -- Biblical and folk -- and drawing on his own personal highs and lows, Gafni offers advice on how to form bonds based in truth and love, along with penetrating analyses of our obstacles. In an increasingly disconnected world, it is still possible to make the connections that matter most: those that will banish loneliness; those that bring us satisfaction, passion, and joy; those that begin with our true selves.   Live your story. Here, a dynamic new voice shows the way.",

I want them back.\" Claiming to be the real Martin Stillwater, the madman wages a relentless and terrifying campaign to eliminate Marty and recapture the family and life he believes to be his.When even bullets fail to stop this savage intruder, the police are hard-pressed to believe the Stillwaters' harrowing account. Unable to rely on the protection of the authorities, the family goes on the run.

        "Authors": "By Loving, Jerome",
        "Description": "Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself is the first full-length critical biography of Walt Whitman in more than forty years. Jerome Loving makes use of recently unearthed archival evidence and newspaper writings to present the most accurate, complete, and complex portrait of the poet to date. This authoritative biography affords fresh, often revelatory insights into many aspects of the poet's life, including his attitudes toward the emerging urban life of America, his relationships with his family members, his developing notions of male-male love, his attitudes toward the vexed issue of race, and his insistence on the union of American states. Virtually every chapter presents material that was previously unknown or unavailable, and Whitman emerges as never before, in all his complexity as a corporal, cerebral, and spiritual being. Loving gives us a new Poet of Democracy, one for the twenty-first century.Loving brings to life the elusive early Whitman, detailing his unhappy teaching career, typesetting jobs, quarrels with editors, and relationships with family and friends. He takes us through the Civil War&#151;with Whitman's moving descriptions of the wounded and dying he nursed, the battlegrounds and camps he visited&#151;demonstrating why the war became one of the defining events of Whitman's life and poetry. Loving's account of Whitman's relationship with Ralph Waldo Emerson is one of the most complete and fascinating available. He also draws insights from new material about Whitman's life as a civil servant, his Lincoln lectures, and his abiding campaign to gain acceptance for what was regarded by many as a \"dirty book.\" He examines each edition of Leaves of Grass in connection with the life and times that produced it, demonstrating how Whitman's poetry serves as a priceless historical document&#151;marking such events as Grant's death, the completion of the Washington monument, Custer's defeat, and the Johnstown flood&#151;at the same time that it reshapes the canon of American literature.The most important gap in the Whitman record is his journalism, which has never been completely collected and edited. Previous biographers have depended on a very incomplete and inaccurate collection. Loving has found long-forgotten runs of the newspapers Whitman worked on and has gathered the largest collection of his journalism to date. He uses these pieces to significantly enhance our understanding of where Whitman stood in the political and ideological spectra of his era.Loving tracks down the sources of anecdotes about Whitman, how they got passed from one biographer to another, were embellished and re-contextualized. The result is a biography in which nothing is claimed without a basis in the factual record. Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself will be an invaluable tool for generations to come, an essential resource in understanding Leaves of Grass and its poet&#151;who defied literary decorum, withstood condemnation, and stubbornly pursued his own way.",

The answer lies in this powerful collection of writings, poems, and sayings by some of the greatest thinkers of the past twenty-five centuries. In succinct original essays, Dyer sets out to explain the meaning and context of each piece of wisdom, and, most important, to explain how we can actively apply these teachings to our modern lives. From sixty ancestral masters \u2013 Buddha, Michelangelo, Rumi, Whitman, Jesus, Emily Dickinson, and Emerson, among others \u2013 here are treasured passages on a variety of subjects, including solitude, time, and passion. Among the contributions are words on inspiration from Pantanjali, author of the Hindu classic Yoga Sutras; teachings about the power of prayer from 13th-century monk St. Francis of Assisi; and thoughts about the importance of action written by Mother Teresa.The voices collected here cut across a wide range of historical eras and cultures, yet they communicate universal truths about the human experience.\u00a0Wisdom of the Ages\u00a0provides us with a marvelous dual opportunity: to receive guidance from our great ancestors and to recognize our own potential for greatness",

Modern African American Writers, part of the Essential Bibliography of American Fiction series, introduces the serious reader and student to each writer's body of work and to sources that illuminate his or her writing and life.

Forewords written by experts in literature offer readers a fuller understanding of the authors as a group and place their writings in a larger context.Entries are arranged alphabetically by author and begin with a complete primary, bibliography of the author's books in all genres: fiction, nonfiction, poetry, drama. The secondary bibliography, intended to enhance the reader's understanding of an author and his works, lists major biographical and critical books and articles. A list of archives locating the principal holdings of an author's manuscripts and private papers completes each entry.Modern African American Writers is the definitive resource for anyone who seeks to expand his or her knowledge about the most widely read African American authors of our time. Whether the reader wants to discover other works by a favorite author or wants to explore the body of criticism that the works have inspired, this volume provides a reliable road map for the literary journey.",

        "Authors": "By Mann, Jim",
        "Description": "When George W. Bush campaigned for the White House, he was such a novice in foreign policy that he couldn't name the president of Pakistan and momentarily suggested he thought the Taliban was a rock-and-roll band. But he relied upon a group called the Vulcans\u2014an inner circle of advisers with a long, shared experience in government, dating back to the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and first Bush administrations. After returning to power in 2001, the Vulcans were widely expected to restore U.S. foreign policy to what it had been under George H. W. Bush and previous Republican administrations. Instead, the Vulcans put America on an entirely new and different course, adopting a far-reaching set of ideas that changed the world and America's role in it. Rise of the Vulcans is nothing less than a detailed, incisive thirty-five-year history of the top six members of the Vulcans\u2014Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Armitage, and Condoleezza Rice\u2014and the era of American dominance they represent. It is the story of the lives, ideas and careers of Bush's war cabinet\u2014the group of Washington insiders who took charge of America's response to September 11 and led the nation into its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Separately, each of these stories sheds astonishing light not only on the formative influences that brought these nascent leaders from obscurity to the pinnacle of power, but also on the experiences, conflicts and competitions that prefigured their actions on the present world stage. Taken together, the individuals in this book represent a unique generation in American history\u2014a generation that might be compared to the \"wise men\" who shaped American policy after World War II or the \"best and brightest\" who prosecuted the war in Vietnam. Over the past three decades, since the time of Vietnam, these individuals have gradually led the way in shaping a new vision of an unchallengeable America seeking to dominate the globe through its military power.",

But unbeknownst to them, a Romulan spy has joined the ranks disguised as a Unification sympathizer. Deceived by this traitor, Spock and his students are taken hostage.Fearful that Spock's knowledge of Federation security will fall into enemy hands, Starfleet dispatches its best ship, the U.S.S. EnterpriseTM 1701-D, and most respected captain, Jean-Luc Picard, to secure the hostages' release. Spock's former shipmate from the original Starship EnterpriseTM, Ambassador McCoy -- over one hundred forty years old, but still as feisty as ever -- is brought in to consult on the negotiations.Their situation is further complicated when Captain Montgomery Scott confiscates an out-of-service starship and effects his own daring rescue of Spock. Picard must now find a way to preserve the Federation's security and prevent a war while treading a mindfield of danger and deadly Romulan politics that threaten his ship, his crew, and the Federation he serves.",

        "Description": "The war against Iraq divided opinion throughout the world and generated a maelstrom of spin and counterspin. The man at the eye of the storm, and arguably the only key player to emerge from it with his integrity intact, was Hans Blix, head of the UN weapons inspection team.This is Dr. Blix\u2019s account of what really happened during the months leading up to the declaration of war in March 2003. In riveting descriptions of his meetings with Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Kofi Annan, he conveys the frustrations, the tensions, the pressure and the drama as the clock ticked toward the fateful hour. In the process, he asks the vital questions about the war: Was it inevitable? Why couldn\u2019t the U.S. and UK get the backing of the other member states of the UN Security Council? Did Iraq have weapons of mass destruction? What does the situation in Iraq teach us about the propriety and efficacy of policies of preemptive attack and unilateral action?Free of the agendas of politicians and ideologues, Blix is the plainspoken, measured voice of reason in the cacophony of debate about Iraq. His assessment of what happened is invaluable in trying to understand both what brought us to the present state of affairs and what we can learn as we try to move toward peace and security in the world after Iraq.",

        "Description": "With this book, managers have a new strategic framework for making explicit connections between what they know about their customers and how they can leverage that information to create value. The authors reveal a comprehensive system that places customer relationships at the center of your business and shows you how to use this system to discover and tap new sources of value to improve your firm's profitability and growth. Customer Connections is full of fresh, practical examples of companies&#151;including ScrubaDub car wash, Inc. magazine, United Parcel Service, MCI Communications, and Wachovia Bank&#151;that have creatively used information and knowledge management technologies to connect with their customers in new ways. It unveils a model for fostering collaboration and playing the right role in supply and demand chains, and gives you the tools for building a strategy based on the four key drivers of customer portfolio value: choosing the customers you want, selecting what you want to offer, deciding what role you should play in meeting their needs, and working together to create mutual value. Wayland and Cole show you how to ask&#151;and act on&#151;the right questions about generating and managing customer knowledge, using connecting technologies, and understanding customer economics in order to assess your firm's current position and determine its ability to capture customer value in the future. Do you know the value of your customer relationship portfolio and manage it to maximize firm value? How can connecting technology can be used to collaborate with or learn from your buyers? What are the major determinants of supplier value to your customers? Are they the same across all customers? Are there opportunities to redesign your product to capture value from another part of the value chain? Which customers should you invite to participate in your product development efforts? How committed are you to your customers' success? Customer Connections will help you discover new ways to think about value creation. It pulls together the strategy and the action plan for building and managing customer portfolios and for leveraging customer relationships for competitive advantage.",

Translating intricate physical concepts into accessible language, she describes how a gravity wave surges through the cosmos at the speed of light and what this phenomenon can tell us about the most violent events in the universe.  Tracing the story of Einstein's theory of relativity and the evolution of physicists' views over the decades, she portrays the key players and puts a personal face on today's experiments. The 12 chapters engage the metaphor of music to reveal how the sounds of exploding and rotating stars, chirps from the merger of two black holes, and even remnant echoes from the mighty jolt of the Big Bang itself comprise Einstein's unfinished symphony still waiting to be heard.

        "Description": "Perhaps only someone who has worked for almost a decade as a medic in New York City's Hell's Kitchen--as Joe Connelly has--could write a novel as riveting and fiercely authentic as Bringing Out the Dead. Like a front-line reporter, Connelly writes from deep within the experience, and the result is a debut novel of extraordinary power and intensity.In Frank Pierce, a brash EMS medic working the streets of Hell's Kitchen, Connelly gives us a man who is being destroyed by the act of saving people. Addicted to the thrill (\"the best drug in the world\") and the mission of the job, Frank is nevertheless drowning in five years' worth of grief and guilt--his own and others': \"my primary role was less about saving lives than about bearing witness.\" His wife has left him, he's drinking on the job, and just a month ago he \"helped to kill\" an eighteen-year-old asthmatic girl. Now she's become the waking nightmare of all his failures: hallucination and projection (\"the ghosts that once visited my dreams had followed me out to the street and were now talking back\"), and as real to him as his own skin. And in reaction to her death, Frank has desperately resurrected a patient back into a life now little better than death.In a narrative that moves with the furious energy of an ambulance run, we follow Frank through two days and nights: into the excitement and dread of the calls; the mad humor that keeps the medics afloat; the memories, distant and recent, through which Frank reminds himself why he became a medic and tries, in vain, to convince himself to give it up. And we are with him as he faces his newest ghost: the resurrected patient, whose demands to be released into death might be the most sensible thing Frank has heard in months, if only he would listen.Bringing Out the Dead is a stunning novel.",
