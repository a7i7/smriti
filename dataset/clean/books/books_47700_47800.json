        "Description": "Are we really at the \"end of history,\" as some have claimed? Has the United States really won the Cold War? Will liberal democracy now triumph over nationalism and totalitarianism? The authors of this book warn that history may already have returned in newly free Eastern Europe, with war in the Balkans, capitalism not yet established, and a number of new democracies already turning autocratic. The West has responded to these sinister developments with paralysis and confusion.The 1989 fall of communism in Eastern Europe occurred in a period when Western intellectuals were involved in a confusing discourse on a number of other dramatic endings: the end of modernity, the end of the century, even the possible end of sociology. Against this backdrop, the authors focus on continuities based on the \"habits of the heart\" of those who threw off communism in Eastern Europe, contrasting them with Western modes of thought. Their cultural explanation draws on theories of Tocqueville, Durkheim, and others to examine positive as well as negative aspects of the nations that survived communism. While focusing on the Balkans, they also make cautious prognoses for the rest of Eastern Europe.They conclude that, in addition to the scenario desired by the West - establishment of a market economy, democracy, and pluralism in postcommunist lands - other possible scenarios need to be recognized, including continued balkanization, conflict, and chaos, and the emergence of new totalitarian states. If the West is to plant democracy in Eastern Europe, it must base its actions on a realistic appraisal of the historical and cultural forces at work. Boosterish optimism and unrealistic hopes, they warn, are an unrealistic response to the fall of communism.",

The Sleeping Angel Killer called his despicable acts \"the perfect crimes.\"The case immobilized the close-knit community of Rockford, Illinois, and nearly destroyed homicide detective Kitt Lundgren's career\u00a0\u2014 and her life.

Young, ambitious detective Mary Catherine Riggio is heading up the Sleeping Angel Killer case.

But M.C., intent on proving herself, fears Kitt will blow the investigation\u00a0\u2014 again.Then Kitt starts receiving disturbing phone calls. It's him\u00a0\u2014 the Sleeping Angel Killer\u00a0\u2014 and he makes Kitt an unthinkable offer: help in finding his copycat.

The girl, the woman, is Claire Marvel, lovely, mercurial, mired in family tragedy. She is the last person someone like Julian should fall in love with. But he does. What ensues is a great and difficult passion strewn with obstacles\u2013not least those arising from Claire and Julian\u2019s disparate characters.

She turned to small-town cooks who are locally famous for their specialties, innkeepers and bakers whose treats lure guests back year after year, and church and bake-sale ladies whose creations are always snapped up at events.Many of Nancy's finds have never been published, or even written down, before. Some of the local treasures include * an irresistibly easy blueberry buckle from a Vermont bed-and-breakfast * a tender peach cobbler from a home cook in the Ozarks who learned it from her mother * a lusciously thick chocolate-banana malted from a celebrated soda fountain in St. Louis * a supremely moist chiffon cake with a zingy orange glaze from Nancy's grandmother's \"receipt\" box * big, soft, glazed gingerbread cookies that were a huge favorite at a former diner in Washington, D.C.* creamy chocolate-dipped caramels, the proprietary secret of the guild members of a New Mexico Episcopal church \"Although I've been baking and writing about sweets for more than three decades, time and time again I found myself thinking, 'What a great idea! I'd never have thought of that,\" Nancy writes in the introduction.Nancy has tested and retested each recipe in her own kitchen, so that you're assured of a flaky, easy-to-roll pie crust, a brownie with a perfect fudgy center and a deep chocolate aroma, and a silky-smooth cheesecake every time -- even if you've never baked before. Since the most memorable desserts are often the ones you make with your children, this book features plenty of projects for the whole family: rock crystal swizzle sticks, caramel apples, graham cracker \"gingerbread\" houses, and gifts such as brownie bars in a jar and quick heavenly hash fudge. The All-American Dessert Book tells the intriguing story of America's fascination with sweets, complete with regional legends, behind-the-scenes recipe stories, fascinating snippets of baking history, and words of kitchen wisdom from cooks of the past.",

Gordon, chief defense correspondent for The New York Times, and retired three-star Marine Corps General Bernard E. Trainor provide a definitive, behind-the-scenes account and analysis of the planning and execution of the Persian Gulf War. The inside story of the war is a tale of politics and clashing military cultures: while one war was being waged against Iraq, another was being fought among the generals themselves. Drawing on interviews with senior allied officials in the Persian Gulf, Western Europe, and the United States, The Generals' War offers unvarnished portraits of top military commanders, as well as new disclosures about the conflicts and power struggles within the anti-Iraq coalition and the American high command.The Air Force believed that wars could be decided through strategic bombing. The Army saw the war as an opportunity to apply its doctrine of maneuver warfare. The Marine Corps approached the Gulf with a history of expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault. The Navy remained aloof from Central Command, preferring to act on its own. Although General Colin Powell and General H. Norman Schwarzkopf were tasked with developing a unified plan from these separate, sometimes conflicting agendas, they never fully harmonized the war plans. As a result, half of Iraq's Republican Guard forces got away. Three and a half years after what was considered a decisive victory, some of the same Iraqi Republican Guard forces that the allies had failed to destroy again menaced Kuwait, forcing President Clinton to order American troops back to the Persian Gulf to prevent a second Iraqi invasion. Saddam Hussein was entrenched and unbowed. The Persian Gulf War was an incomplete success.",

Bramley Castle was a damp, chill place, over\u00feowing with eccentric relatives. But there was also Trevelyan, a secretive, brooding man who lived in Bramley's ancient halls.
