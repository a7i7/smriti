But in the more than twenty years that followed, the three had moved on with their lives, settled in different cities, and found successful careers and new roles as mothers and wives. By chance, each would find herself alone for a few weeks one summer, wrestling with the present and the past. At a sprawling ranch in the foothills of Wyoming's Grand Teton Range, the three women come together and find courage, healing, and truth, and reach out to each other once again.Despite the honesty they once shared, now pretense between them runs high. Mary Stuart Walker, married for twenty-two years to a Manhattan lawyer, kept herself busy with volunteer work, and now masks the loneliness that consumes her life. A year has past, and Mary Stuart still hasn't gotten over the guilt, or the fear that her husband will never forgive her for their son's death... Tanya Thomas, an award winning singer and rock star, enjoys all the trappings of fame and success--a mansion in Bel Air, legions of fans, and a broken heart. All the Grammy awards in the world can't make up for the children she wanted but never had, the men who have taken advantage of her, and just gone along for the ride, and still are... Dr. Zoe Phillips has her hands full as a single mother to an adopted two-year-old, and as a doctor at an AIDS clinic in San Francisco. Predictably, as they all know, she is as liberal as she ever was, and marriage was never a dream she coveted or shared with them. Tending to her patients is a full-time job that leaves Zoe little time for herself--until unexpected news forces her to reevaluate both her future, and her current life.But despite the changes in their lives, their friendship is still a bond they all treasure and share. For each of the women, a few weeks at the ranch will bring healing and release, as old hurts are buried, ancient secrets revealed, and love replaced or renewed. In The Ranch, bestselling novelist Danielle Steel brings reality to the meaning of friendship, with dramas whose truths we all share.",

In an elegant palazzo on the Grand Canal, an American ambassador's tryst turns deadly. In the seamy underbelly of London, a pub-crawling killer is on the loose.

And to a remote Indonesian island where a madman tinkers with strains of a deadly virus and slyly bides his time.  Hawke must call upon resources deep within himself. He must enter a race against time to stop a cataclysmic attack on America's most populous cities and avengethe inexplicable and horrific crime that has left him devastated.

        "Title": "Billie's Kiss",
        "Authors": "By Knox, Elizabeth",
        "Description": "1. Could the story of Billie and Murdo have happened anytime, anywhere? What aspects of it depend on the fact that it is set in the Western Isles of Scotland in 1903? 2. Billie's Kiss begins with the explosion of a ship that might be an accident, an act of sabotage, or murder. Why do you think Murdo jumps at the idea of blaming Billie for the crime? Though we know Billie is innocent, she feels culpable because the kiss she and her brother-in-law exchanged seemed to bring on the tragedy, 'as if their kiss was a match to a fuse.' Explore the ways in which Murdo and Billie both carry guilt for the deaths of others: the two Ingrids, Karl, Ian, and Edith. 3. What feelings did Billie's dyslexia and clumsiness arouse in you--sympathy, exasperation, admiration, disgust? 'She was born knowing,' Murdo says, 'in compensation for her incapacity.' Consider the points at which she overcomes her old habits or reveals new strength. Do other characters, too, have weaknesses to match their powers? 4. We think of eugenics as a sinister, proto-Nazi idea of the early twentieth century. But it could be argued that modern biogenetic research, with its potential to be used to 'weed out' traits that are perceived as undesirable (from Down's Syndrome to homosexuality, bipolar illness to breast cancer), amounts to the same thing. What aspects of the eugenics debate are explored in Billie's Kiss? Have you read any novels set nowadays that take up this issue? 5. At first, Murdo hounds Billie, determined to prove his suspect guilty of mass murder. At what point, and how, does this hounding begin to turn into love? Later in the book, when Rory is walking along beside Murdo and planning to kill him, Murdo becomes aware that 'Rory coveted something about him, as Ian had coveted the air between them.' Discuss the idea of hate and desire as two sides of the same coin. 6. On one level, this is a mystery novel. As you were drawn into the world of Kissach and Skilling, how preoccupied did you find yourself with the puzzle of the ship's explosion? Did you guess the identity of the killer, or even try? Lord Hallowhulme presents himself as an enlightened, benevolent, visionary landlord. How does Elizabeth Knox gradually strip away his masks? Consider how she has intertwined the characters' emotional journeys with the story of the crime investigation. 7. At one point Georgie decides 'he was going to save Murdo's miserable life.' The novel is full of moments at which people save each other's lives--or think that is what they are doing, as when Murdo hauls Billie out of the sea. 'Debts are damnation,' says Murdo, with reference to the money he owes his cousin Lord Hallowhulme. What does Murdo owe Ian, Geordie, and Clara? What about Billie--what does she owe her sister, and Henry? Talk about these different forms of debt and generosity. 8. What divides Murdo and Billie, apart from the fifteen years between them? What qualities do they have in common? One experience they share is that of bereavement and lasting sorrow. 'This was a sadness that sang along with hers,' Knox writes, 'another soul with perfect pitch.' What are the effects of bereavement--both traumatic and liberating--on Murdo, and on Billie? 9. Dead people (especially Edith and Ian) have a particularly strong role in this novel. How do they seem changed after their deaths? In what ways do those who love them come to reinterpret the stories and characters of the dead? 10. Billie's Kiss turns out to be full of triangles, and some of them are literally as well as metaphorically incestuous. Consider the relations between Billie, Edith, and Henry; James, Clara, and Murdo; Ingrid, Karl, and Murdo; Murdo and Ingrid Hallow. How does this theme of forbidden desire between near relations (sister-in-law and brother-in-law, father and daughter, first cousins) link to the hidden intensity of gay desire felt by Ian and other men on the island? 11. Though the book is set mostly on an island, the characters are not confined to one spot; they seem to travel constantly by boat, horse, train, or foot. They also send telegrams and read newspapers. How do these technologies of the early twentieth century offset the less modern, elemental, even Gothic aspects of the story? 12. 'She'd finally found her way through the tricky currents of their mismatched tides,' we are told of Billie and Murdo near the end of the book. In this novel set on an island, water is an omnipresent metaphor as well as a literal reality. Billie loves to swim, and as a child she learns to fake drowning for money. By contrast, sailors don't learn to swim, as it only prolongs the agony of drowning in cold seas. Compare the various scenes of swimming and of drowning in this novel. Notice how Knox uses the imagery of water, ice, and polar bears in describing Murdo in particular. 13. Whose story is Billie's Kiss? The sections from Billie's point of view alternate with those set in Murdo's head, and also (from the fourth chapter on) with pieces from Geordie's perspective. What does Geordie add to the mix? How would the novel be different if it had only one point-of-view character, or ten? 14. The heroine of this novel has a name that sounds like a boy's. What playful or ironic associations can be attached to other names in the book: Murdo? Clara? Hallow? Minnie? Kiss Castle? 15. All the characters have to puzzle over the details they recall of the shipwreck, in order to solve the crime. Ironically, Henry is partially amnesiac after his near-drowning, so for him, it is as if the fatal kiss never happened. Similarly, Murdo was too drunk to remember sleeping with Clara and fathering Ingrid. Geordie struggles to remember what his dead brother and he were really like, and he relies on rereading their letters. By contrast, Billie cannot read, but her powerful memory compensates for it. Why do you think memory is one of Elizabeth Knox's recurring themes? 16. Billie's Kiss seems to refer to the kiss between her and Henry that starts the story. By the end, what does the phrase conjure up for you? What does it mean for Billie to, as she says, 'choose who to kiss'? 'I hope you'll never be civilized,' Murdo tells Billie toward the end of the book. What do you think he means? As a wife, a mother, and a cinema pianist, has Billie become civilized or not? 17. Do you think historical fiction has to have close contemporary parallels to be relevant, or is it enough for it to be about things in the past which still matter?",

Girls now comprise thirty-three percent of all high school athletes, representing a dramatic increase from four percent who participated in 1971, the year before the enactment of Title IX. You Go Girl! is a collection of first person insights, thoughts and stories from successful women in the world of sports. Athletes, coaches, and sports executives talk about their lives, their dreams, their frustrations and disappointments-as well as their victories and passions, practice habits and perspectives. Their stories will inspire, teach, motivate, encourage and challenge any reader-male or female. Among the women who have contributed their personal anecdotes and insights are: Mia Hamm (soccer); Gabrielle Reece (beach volleyball); Marion Jones (sprinter and long jumper); Kerri Strug (gymnastics); Chris Evert (tennis); Nancy Lopez (golf); Picabo Street (Olympic gold medal skier) and many others. Most of today's young women went through school after the 1972 passage of title IX: the same cannot be said of their mothers. This book provides a powerful opportunity to close that gap.",

        "Title": "The Service Profit Chain",
        "Authors": "By Heskett, James L., Sasser, W. Earl, and Schlesinger, Leonard A.",
        "Description": "In this pathbreaking book, world-renowned Harvard Business School service firm experts James L. Heskett, W. Earl Sasser, Jr. and Leonard A. Schlesinger reveal that leading companies stay on top by managing the service profit chain.Why are a select few service firms better at what they do -- year in and year out -- than their competitors? For most senior managers, the profusion of anecdotal \"service excellence\" books fails to address this key question. Based on five years of painstaking research, the authors show how managers at American Express, Southwest Airlines, Banc One, Waste Management, USAA, MBNA, Intuit, British Airways, Taco Bell, Fairfield Inns, Ritz-Carlton Hotel, and the Merry Maids subsidiary of ServiceMaster employ a quantifiable set of relationships that directly links profit and growth to not only customer loyalty and satisfaction, but to employee loyalty, satisfaction, and productivity. The strongest relationships the authors discovered are those between (1) profit and customer loyalty; (2) employee loyalty and customer loyalty; and (3) employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction. Moreover, these relationships are mutually reinforcing; that is, satisfied customers contribute to employee satisfaction and vice versa. Here, finally, is the foundation for a powerful strategic service vision, a model on which any manager can build more focused operations and marketing capabilities. For example, the authors demonstrate how, in Banc One's operating divisions, a direct relationship between customer loyalty measured by the \"depth\" of a relationship, the number of banking services a customer utilizes, and profitability led the bank to encourage existing customers to further extend the bank services they use. Taco Bell has found that their stores in the top quadrant of customer satisfaction ratings outperform their other stores on all measures. At American Express Travel Services, offices that ticket quickly and accurately are more profitable than those which don't. With hundreds of examples like these, the authors show how to manage the customer-employee \"satisfaction mirror\" and the customer value equation to achieve a \"customer's eye view\" of goods and services. They describe how companies in any service industry can (1) measure service profit chain relationships across operating units; (2) communicate the resulting self-appraisal; (3) develop a \"balanced scorecard\" of performance; (4) develop a recognitions and rewards system tied to established measures; (5) communicate results company-wide; (6) develop an internal \"best practice\" information exchange; and (7) improve overall service profit chain performance. What difference can service profit chain management make? A lot. Between 1986 and 1995, the common stock prices of the companies studied by the authors increased 147%, nearly twice as fast as the price of the stocks of their closest competitors. The proven success and high-yielding results from these high-achieving companies will make The Service Profit Chain required reading for senior, division, and business unit managers in all service companies, as well as for students of service management.",

Second, professional services are highly personalized, involving the skills of individuals. Such firms must therefore compete not only for clients but also for talented professionals.  Drawing on more than ten years of research and consulting to these unique and creative companies, David Maister explores issues ranging from marketing and business development to multinational strategies, human resources policies to profit improvement, strategic planning to effective leadership. While these issues can be complex, Maister simplifies them by recognizing that \u201cevery professional service firm in the world, regardless of size, specific profession, or country of operation, has the same mission statement: outstanding service to clients, satisfying careers for its people, and financial success for its owners.\u201d",

Often the very things parents do to develop self-esteem in their children does just the opposite.  Dr. Leman helps parents avoid that.Some of the topics addressed are \"Oh, no, I told myself I would never do that to my kids.\"  There is a crucial difference between praise and encouragement, and \"how to raise responsible children\".  Readers will learn to develop a strategy of discipline that works in any family with any child and how to get the best behavior from each child.  At the end of each chapter, readers will find steps to follow in their own families plus self-evaluating questions that help them gain insight into their own parenting style.  There is also a question-and-answer section to quickly reference specific problem areas.",

        "Title": "On the Cosmic Horizon: Ten Great Mysteries for Third Millennium Astronomy (Mysteries for the New Millennium)",
        "Authors": "By Bennett, Jeffrey O.",
        "Description": "Share the wonder of the ten great mysteries of 21st century astronomy -- with an astronomer as your guide!   Are we alone? What is the fate of the universe?   Is the inflationary big bang theory true? What is the universe really made of?   Compelling explanations for any educated reader -- even those with no science or math background!   Outside of religion, no human pursuit deals with deeper questions of existence than astronomy, and few areas of science compare in capturing the public imagination. Today, however, the pace of discovery is so rapid that even professional astronomers have difficulty staying current. In this book, an astronomer and award-winning, highly acclaimed teacher shares the ten deepest mysteries that motivate astronomy today -- from the quest for life outside Earth, to the ultimate fate of the universe. It's an awesome collection of mysteries, and Jeffrey Bennett explains each one with remarkable clarity, enabling any educated citizen to share in the wonder, no matter how little scientific or mathematics background they may have. Is there life elsewhere in our solar system? Where are the Sun's missing neutrinos? What does the universe look like? How do galaxies evolve? Are Earth-like planets common? What makes gamma-ray bursts? Is the inflationary big bang theory true? What is the universe made out of -- and what is its fate? Every mystery is framed with a story that draws upon history or an especially resonant metaphor, then explained in detail,  but simply enough for those coming to astronomy for the first time.   Jeffrey O. Bennett is Research Associate at the Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy in Boulder, CO, and holds a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Colorado. As Visiting Senior Scientist at NASA, he guided the creation of NASA's Initiative to Develop Education through Astronomy (IDEA). Later, he led the creation of the Colorado Scale Model Solar System, a 1-to-10 billion scale model of the solar system; he is now co-leader of a project to build a similar scale model on the National Mall in Washington, DC, in a cooperative effort with the Smithsonian Institution, the Challenger Center, and NASA. He is author of two Addison Wesley books for non-scientists: The Cosmic Perspective and Using and Understanding Mathematics.",

        "Authors": "By Theroux, Phyllis (EDT)",
        "Description": "This invaluable anthology is the first and only collection dedicated to the art of the eulogy. For the past several years, Phyllis Theroux has collected the most eloquent and moving writing commemorating a death, assessing a life, or offering solace to the bereaved. Ranging from Thomas Jefferson's magisterial eulogy for George Washington to Anna Quindlen's affectionate memorial for her grandmother; from Helen Keller's words about her dear friend Mark Twain to Adlai Stevenson's about Eleanor Roosevelt, The Book of Eulogies establishes that great eulogies are a celebration of remarkable lives that can illuminate, confirm, inspire, and redirect our own.  Theroux has included some of the world's most well-known tributes, such as Pericles' Funeral Oration, Jules Michelet's appreciation of Jeanne d'Arc, Victor Hugo's ringing words on the one hundredth anniversary of Voltaire's death, Cardinal Suenens's eulogy for Pope John XXIII. But most of the eulogized assembled here are eighteenth- to twentieth-century Americans, and the stories of their lives illuminate our history with a particularly intimate light. In Robert Kennedy's extemporaneous remarks upon hearing of the death of Martin Luther King, or Eugene McCarthy's tribute to his friend and colleague, Hubert Humphrey, the values, wisdom, and spirit of both the eulogized and the eulogizer are revealed.  The Book of Eulogies is a sourcebook for anyone who must find words of solace, understanding, and inspiration on the occasion of a beloved's death. It is also a treasury of astonishing eloquence, passion, and humanity -- a record of extraordinary lives, seen through the eyes of those who knew and loved them.",

Ban Breathnach believes that women are endowed not with five senses but with seven. In addition to rediscovering sight, sound, scent, taste, and touch, readers will come to cherish their sense of \"knowing\" -- a woman's intuitive sense -- and \"wonder,\" her sense of rapture and reverence.  Writing in the style so beloved by her millions of readers, and drawing on myth, literature, film, music, and drama, Ban Breathnach encourages each woman to discover what moves her to tears, makes her blood rush to her head, her heart skip a beat, and her soul sigh. Interwoven with the text are seasonal indulgences intended to restore weary feminine souls -- recipes, rituals, decorating, fashion, and gardening hints. By encouraging her to delight in the often overlooked gifts of every day -- from the aroma of simmering homemade spaghetti sauce to the sensation of freshly laundered linen against bare skin -- Romancing the Ordinary is sure to help every woman fall in love with Life.",

        "Authors": "By Okun, Arthur M.",
        "Description": "Contemporary American society has the look of a split-level structure. Its political and social institutions distribute rights and privileges universally and proclaim the equality of all citizens. Yet economic institutions, with efficiency as their guiding principle, create disparities among citizens in living standards and material welfare. This mixture of equal rights and unequal economic status breeds tensions between the political principles of democracy and the economic principles of capitalism. Whenever the wealthy try for extra helpings of supposedly equal rights, and whenever the workings of the market deny anyone a minimum standard of living, \"dollars transgress on rights\"in the author's phrase.In this revised and expanded version of the Godkin Lectures presented at the John F. Kennedy School at Harvard University in April 1974, Arthur M. Okun explores the conflicts that arise when society's desire to reduce inequality would impair economic efficiency, confronting policymakers with \"the big tradeoff.\"Other economic systems have attempted to solve this problem; but the best of socialist experiments have achieved a greater degree of equality than our mixed capitalist democracy only at heavy costs in efficiency, and dictatorial governments have reached heights of efficiency only by rigidly repressing their citizenry.In contrast, our basic system emerges as a viable, if uneasy, compromise in which the market has its place and democratic institutions keep it in check. But within the existing system there are ways to gain more of one good thing at a lower cost in terms of the other. In Okun's view, society's concern for human dignity can be directed at reducing the economic deprivation that stains the record of American democracythrough progressive taxation, transfer payments, job programs, broadening equality of opportunity, eliminating racial and sexual discrimination, and lowering barriers to access to capital.",

Exiled and disgraced, and nearly destroyed, Gabriella struggles to survive on her own in New York.\u00a0\u00a0There she seeks healing and escape through her writing again, this time as an adult, and her life as a writer begins.\u00a0\u00a0But just when she thinks she is beyond hurt, Gabriella is once again betrayed by someone she trusts.\u00a0\u00a0Brought to the edge of despair, physically attacked beyond recognition and belief, haunted by abuse in her present and her past, she nonetheless manages to find hope again, and the courage to face the past.\u00a0\u00a0On a pilgrimage destined to bring her face-to-face with those who sought to destroy her in her early life, she finds forgiveness, freedom from guilt, and healing from abuse.\u00a0\u00a0When Gabriella faces what was done to her, and why, she herself is free at last.\u00a0\u00a0With profound insight, Danielle Steel has created a vivid portrait of an abused child's broken world, and the courage necessary to face it and free herself from the past.\u00a0\u00a0A work of daring and compassion, a tale of healing that will shock and touch and move you to your very soul, it exposes the terror of child abuse, and opens the doors on a subject that affects us all.\u00a0\u00a0The Long Road Home is more than riveting fiction.\u00a0\u00a0It is an inspiration to us all.\u00a0\u00a0A work of courage, hope, and love.",
