        "Description": "00  The challenge to understanding history lies in the tendency to focus on single scenes instead of the big picture, akin to looking at a tapes-try by examining individual stitches instead of the entire design. The Atlas of World History undertakes a fair-minded journey through the human story by mingling close-up looks at events with broader views of what was then happening elsewhere in the world.  Each of this book's six sections, arranged chronologically, opens with a world map that shows developments at various points of the compass, along with an essay about what was happening and why.  Cross-cultural time lines run through the book like a thick thread, tying all of history together. Thus, as one reads a section on Charlemagne, for example, the time line shows selected events happening in Nubia, in India, in China, and in Cyprus.  The text by author Noel Grove, a staff writer for 25 years with the National Geographic magazine, continues with a world-wide perspective usually ignored in works of history: \"By A.D. 100, when the Roman Empire was in full swing, some Maya cities were already in decline.\"  Events are examined for their local as well as global impact: \"Great empires butted heads and power changed hands, but these episodes fed a...kinship with a wider community.\"  Here, then, as Daniel J. Boorstin says in his foreword, \"...is an invitation to discover both the mystery and the miracle of human experience on our planet,\" as Grove shapes complex history into an understandable tale with a storyteller's eye for little-known details: \"Russia's...Peter the Great died at the age of 53 after diving into the Neva River in winter to rescue drowning sailors.\" And \"Vikings were not just ruthless killers; they traded as often as they raided, and their wives knew rights that other medieval women could scarcely imagine.\"  Artwork, maps, and photographs complement the text to tell the story of human history in a single volume.

Providing a starship for the academy to be piloted by Captain Priscilla \"Hutch\" Hutchins, the Contact Society embarks on a mission to find the source of the transmission. Across a myriad of stars, from world to world, Hutch and her crew follow the signal, but find only puzzles and lethal surprises.Then, in a planetary system far beyond the bounds of previous exploration, they discover an object. It is immense, ominous and mysterious. And it may hold the answer not only to the questions of the Contact Society, but to those of every person who has ever looked to the sky and wondered if we were alone.",

Arranged in scriptural order from Genesis to Revelation, the book presents each poem alongside the biblical passage that inspired it. Thus readers can conveniently witness the various ways sacred text has sparked the imagination of poets throughout the ages. The editors have included poems by virtually all the prominent religious poets--among them John Donne, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Edward Taylor, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Included, too, are devotional and visionary works from a wide range of vintage poets--Robert Burns, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Christina Rossetti, Alfred Tennyson, and Robert Browning. Proving that the Bible is just as powerful a source of inspiration today as it was in the past, the collection also assembles a mixed congregation of modern and contemporary poets, such as Dylan Thomas, Robert Frost, William Carlos Williams, Countee Cullen, e.e. cummings, William Butler Yeats, Laura (Riding) Jackson, A.D. Hope, Denise Levertov, and Philip Levine.Of enduring interest to readers of both scripture and literature, this anthology illuminates key passages of the Old and New Testament. In selection after selection, readers will encounter an astonishing variety of religious experiences, as a host of poets from many eras and many backgrounds respond to Holy Scripture profoundly and imaginatively.",

        "Description": "\"Mates are not always matches, and matches are not always mates,\" pronounces Magda Danvers, the magnificent central figure in Gail Godwin's wise and affecting new novel. With The Good Husband, one of America's most gifted novelists creates a portrait of two marriages and four unforgettable characters that travels beyond the usual questions of love and domestic comfort to explore the most profound consequences of intimate relationships. It is also, in its deepest sense, a novel about how we influence and transform - and sometimes complete - one another.As a young woman, brilliant, charismatic, and eternally curious, Marsha Danziger transformed herself into Magda Danvers, taking the academic world by storm with her controversial treatise on visionaries, The Book of Hell. She was already a star when she came upon Francis Lake in a midwestern seminary and married him, to everyone's surprise, including their own. It was a mating that seemed perfect: Magda pursued her career, and attentive, caring Francis devoted himself to Magda. Now, Magda's grave illness puts their marriage to its ultimate test.Even as she faces her \"Final Examination,\" Magda's genius does not desert her. From her bed she continues to arouse her visitors with compelling thoughts and questions, which will change the lives of some of them. Into the heady atmosphere of Magda's provocative repartee comes Alice Henry, fresh from her own family tragedy. Magda's room soon becomes a refuge for Alice from her crumbling marriage to brooding Southern novelist Hugo Henry.But is it the incandescence of Magda's ideas that draws Alice, or the secret of \"the good marriage\" that she is desperate to discover? For Alice, Hugo, Francis, and Magda will learn that the most ideal relationship - even a perfect marriage - doesn't come without a price.Gracefully written, keenly insightful, intimate in its revelations, The Good Husband reverberates with the lives of its characters, their histories, and the most urgent longings of their hearts - a triumph of the novelist's art, from the author of A Mother and Two Daughters, The Finishing School, A Southern Family, and Father Melancholy's Daughter, all of which were New York Times bestsellers.",

Here is the true story behind  the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will  of America. In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima\u2014and  into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches  strewn with comrades, they battled to the island's highest peak. And after climbing  through a landscape of hell itself, they raised a flag. Now the son of one of the  flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came  together in a moment that will live forever. To his family, John Bradley never spoke  of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy, his family discovered  closed boxes of letters and photos. In Flags of Our Fathers, James Bradley draws  on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company.  Following these men's paths to Iwo Jima, James Bradley has written a classic story  of the heroic battle for the Pacific's most crucial island\u2014an island riddled with  Japanese tunnels and 22,000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man. But  perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory.  The men in the photo\u2014three were killed during the battle\u2014were proclaimed heroes and  flown home, to become reluctant symbols. For two of them, the adulation was shattering.  Only James Bradley's father truly survived, displaying no copy of the famous photograph  in his home, telling his son only:  \u201cThe real heroes of Iwo Jima were the guys who  didn't come back. \u201d Few books ever have captured the complexity and furor of war  and its aftermath as well as Flags of Our Fathers. A penetrating, epic look at a  generation at war, this is history told with keen insight, enormous honesty, and  the passion of a son paying homage to his father. It is the story of the difference  between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human  experience of war.",

To illuminate the vital relationship between history and geographical conditions, W. Gordon East draws examples from ancient times to the mid\u2013twentieth century. He demonstrates that when we look at the physical conditions under which an event occurs, we find that \"the particular characteristics of this setting serve not only to localise but also to influence part at least of the action.\" Topographical position, climate, distribution of water and minerals, the placement of routes and towns, and ease or difficulty of movement between districts and countries are among the factors which the historian must take into account.Professor East's topics include the role of geography in international politics, the contribution of the geographer to the study of ancient civilizations, and the use of old maps as historical documents.",

        "Description": "In 1811, Jane Austen\u2019s first published work, Sense and Sensibility, marked the debut of England\u2019s premier novelist of manners. Believing that \u201c3 or 4 families in a country village is the very thing to work on,\u201d she created a brilliant tragicomedy of flirtation and folly. Romantic walks through lush Devonshire and genteel dinner parties at a stately manor draw two pretty sisters into the schemes and manipulations of landed gentry determined to marry wisely and well. Neither sense nor sensibility can guarantee happiness for either\u2014as romantic Marianne falls prey to a dangerous rascal, and reasonable Elinor loses her heart to a gentleman already engaged. Wonderfully entertaining yet subtle and probing in its characterizations, Sense and Sensibility richly displays the supreme artistry of a great English novelist.",

Relevant today? Many readers will be surprised by how truly relevant the Book of Genesis is. It discusses, among other things, the first recorded case of sexual harassment; surrogate parenting and the problems it raises; siblings battling over the love of a parent; rape and its consequences; and vigilante justice. The issues faced by Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, and their descendants are remarkably similar to those that arise in all of our lives.",

        "Authors": "By Shakespeare, William, Mowat, Barbara A. (EDT), and Werstine, Paul (EDT)",
        "Description": "In 1603, James VI of Scotland ascended the English throne, becoming James I of England. London was alive with an interest in all things Scottish, and Shakespeare turned to Scottish history for material. He found a spectacle of violence and stories of traitors advised by witches and wizards, echoing James\u2019s belief in a connection between treason and witchcraft. In depicting a man who murders to become king, Macbeth teases us with huge questions. Is Macbeth tempted by fate, or by his or his wife\u2019s ambition? Why does their success turn to ashes? Like other plays, Macbeth speaks to each generation. Its story was once seen as that of a hero who commits an evil act and pays an enormous price. Recently, it has been applied to nations that overreach themselves and to modern alienation. The line is blurred between Macbeth\u2019s evil and his opponents\u2019 good, and there are new attitudes toward both witchcraft and gender. The authoritative edition of Macbeth from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:  -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play\u2019s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare\u2019s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library\u2019s vast holdings of rare books -An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading Essay by Susan Snyder The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world\u2019s largest collection of Shakespeare\u2019s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe. In addition to exhibitions open to the public throughout the year, the Folger offers a full calendar of performances and programs. For more information, visit Folger.edu.",

This authoritative work provides an integrated account of the structure and function of genes and incorporates all the latest research in the field.    THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REORGANIZATION TO DATE   The power of direct analysis of the genome has made a significant difference in the approach of GENES VII. In a departure from previous editions, which started with a traditional analysis of formal genetics, the new edition begins with the molecular properties of the gene itself. The text is now reorganized to begin with the concept of genes as a segment of DNA coding for protein, and then proceeds directly to the characterization of the genome in terms of its content of genes.   INTEGRATED APPROACH   GENES VII first explains the structure and function of the gene as a means to revealing the operation of the genome as a whole, and offers an integrated approach to prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The gene is considered from all aspects, including:   * Basic forms   * The numbers and relationships among genes in a genome   * Their packaging into chromosomes   * The process of gene expression from transcription through translation   * The reproduction and safeguarding of the gene structure   * Aspects of the overall circuitry through which genotype determines phenotype   STREAMLINED, FULL-COLOR DESIGN   GENES VII has been considerably restructured and reorganized to highlight the latest research and technology. It contains more than 800 full color illustrations that are extremely useful in teaching the key concepts presented in the book.  GENES VII CONTAINS NEW, GROUNDBREAKING INFORMATION ON:  * New technologies that count and compare expressed genes   * Accessory proteins (chaperones)   * The role of the proteasome   * Licensing   * Reverse translocation   * Connections between repair and recombination systems and human diseases   * Connections between the structure of chromosomal material and control of gene expression in eukaryotes   * The process of X chromosome inactivation   * Imprinting   * Control of gene expression by epigenetic changes   * The enzymatic activities that control chromatin structure and affect the regulatory process   * Archeael enzymes   * The mechanism of RNA editing in lower eukaryotes   * The role of RAG genes   * Interactions within and between pathways   * The use of protein degradation to control passage through the cell cycle   * Programmed cell death   * Telomerase and its role in carcinogenesis.

        "Description": "In perhaps the most profound character portrait she has ever drawn, America's bestselling true-crime writer, Ann Rule, asks, Can the female really be deadlier than the male? In Heart Full of Lies, she answers that question in one of her most intriguing tales ever -- a riveting story of seduction, betrayal, and murder.  Liysa and Chris Northon seemed the epitome of idyllic lovers when they married on a moonlit beach in Hawaii. Their friends admired the romantic couple: Chris -- tall, athletic, handsome with a thatch of blond hair, a pilot for Hawaiian Airlines -- and Liysa -- attractive, charismatic, seductive, an acclaimed surf photographer, with a tanned, perfect body. Their son, Bjorn, looked just like his dad, and they were raising Liysa's son by a previous marriage. They had beautiful homes on the mainland and in Hawaii.  But it wasn't long before Chris saw a side of Liysa that he hadn't glimpsed before. Nothing was quite enough for her -- she wanted more money, more property, and a future that included fame as a Hollywood screenwriter. She complained to her closest friends that her husband was a heavy drinker who beat her. The marriage seemed to be unraveling, but Chris struggled to hold it together, afraid he'd be separated from Bjorn and from Liysa's son, Papako. And then the worst happened.  On a sunny morning in October 2000, Chris Northon lay dead in a sleeping bag at a campsite beside a pristine river, while his wife drove four hours to a friend's house, sobbing inconsolably. She appeared to have been beaten, and had a black eye and bruises on her knee. Was Chris's death a tragic accident or a deliberate homicide? Was Liysa involved? Questions arose that made Oregon State detectives suspicious, yet her family and friends stood staunchly by her, incredulous that anybody would ask such questions.  Ann Rule became involved with the mystery of Chris's death when one of his fellow pilots at Hawaiian Airlines contacted her, and only later did she learn that the ranking Oregon State Police investigator had thought of her to tell this bizarre story. A book that leads the reader from Hawaii to the Northwest to Hollywood, Heart Full of Lies is an extraordinary character study as well as a brilliant investigative report that will keep you enthralled to the very last page.",

        "Authors": "By Moore, Dinty W.",
        "Description": "The Accidental Buddhist\u00a0is the funny, provocative story of how Dinty Moore went looking for the faith he'd lost in what might seem the most unlikely of places: the ancient Eastern tradition of Buddhism. Moore demystifies and explains the contradictions and concepts of this most mystic-seeming of religious traditions. This plain-spoken, insightful look at the dharma in America will fascinate anyone curious about the wisdom of other cultures and other religions.\u00a0 Cutting through religious jargon and abstract concepts, Moore explains in clear terms why Buddhism is becoming part of popular culture. He has the rare ability to be at once sincere about religion and good-humored about the human condition. The Accidental Buddhist never takes itself too seriously\u2014which, as Moore discovers, Buddhists aren\u2019t supposed to do, even when they are mindful, enlightened, and sitting perfectly still.  \u201cMoore\u2019s hilarious and sometimes irreverent look at Buddhism is a perfect primer for the budding Buddhist.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly \u201c[Moore\u2019s] witty and candid \u2018regular guy\u2019 approach to these experiences is entertaining and comforting, and his conclusions are right on target.\u201d\u2014Booklist",

Baker Towers is a family saga and a love story, a hymn to a time and place long gone, to America's industrial past, and to the men and women we now call the Greatest Generation.

        "Description": "A Brookings Institution Press and Visions of Governance for the 21st Century publicationFar from being another short-lived buzzword, \"globalization\" refers to real changes. These changes have profound impacts on culture, economics, security, the environment&#151;and hence on the fundamental challenges of governance. This book asks three fundamental questions: How are patterns of globalization currently evolving? How do these patterns affect governance? And how might globalism itself be governed? The first section maps the trajectory of globalization in several dimensions&#151;economic, cultural, environmental, and political. For example, Graham Allison speculates about the impact on national and international security, and William C. Clark develops and evaluates the concepts of \"environmental globalization.\" The second section examines the impact of globalization on governance within individual nations (including China, struggling countries in the developing world, and the industrialized democracies) and includes Elaine Kamarck's assessment of global trends in public-sector reform. The third section discusses efforts to improvise new approaches to governance, including the role of non-governmental institutions, the global dimensions of information policy, and Dani Rodrik's speculation on global economic governance.",

A direct follow-up to the original How Come?, How Come? Planet Earth is packed with lively, engagingly written, and often wittily illustrated answers to questions that kids have about the natural world around them. There are questions about animals - Why are electric eels electrical? (the charges not only help them find their way around in the dark, but act as a defense system). About human body - Where does the fat go when you lose weight? (it's burned up inside the muscles for energy). About Earth science - Why are storm clouds gray? (they contain a lot of water, which absorbs more sunlight than an ordinary cloud does, so storm clouds appear ominously dark). And just about everyday stuff - How do they make chewing gum? Why are diamonds the hardest material on Earth? Why do dogs bark? For all kids who want to know (and all kids want to know), and for the parents who can't always explain it to them (no parents know every answer), How Come?

Decades before today's creative management trends, Hewlett-Packard invented such strategies as \"walk-around management\", \"flextime\", and \"quality cycles\". Always sensitive to the needs of its customers and responsive to employee input, Hewlett-Packard earned massive steady growth that far outshone its competitors' vacillating fortunes, even with radically different products from those responsible for its initial boom.   For entrepreneurs and managers alike, the wisdom found in these pages is invaluable if they want their businesses to gain steady growth and consistent success.
