        "Title": "To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight",
        "Authors": "By Tobin, James",
        "Description": "\"For some years I have been afflicted with the belief that flight is possible to man. My disease has increased in severity and I feel that it will soon cost me an increased amount of money if not my life.\"  So wrote a quiet young Ohioan in 1900, one in an ancient line of men who had wanted to fly -- men who wanted it passionately, fecklessly, hopelessly. But now, at the turn of the twentieth century, Wilbur Wright and a scattered handful of other adventurers conceived a conviction that the dream lay at last within reach, and in a headlong race across ten years and two continents, they competed to conquer the air. James Tobin, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in biography, has at last given this inspiring story its definitive telling. For years Wright and his younger brother, Orville, experimented in utter obscurity, supported only by their exceptional family. Meanwhile, the world watched as the imperious Samuel Langley, armed with a rich contract from the U.S. War Department and all the resources of the Smithsonian Institution, sought to scale up his unmanned models to create the first manned flying machine. But while Langley became obsessed with flight as a problem of power, the Wrights grappled with it as a problem of balance. Thus their machines took two very different paths -- his toward oblivion, theirs toward the heavens.  As Tobin relates, the Wrights' 1903 triumph at Kitty Hawk, however hallowed in American lore, was ill-reported and disbelieved. So, while the two brothers struggled to transform their delicate contraption into a practical airplane, others moved to overtake them as the leading pioneers of flight. In France, rivals scoffed at the Wrights even as they rushed to imitate them. At home, the great inventor Alexander Graham Bell seized the fallen banner of his friend Langley and thrust it into the hands of a circle of young daredevils, urging them to get into the air. From this group emerged the motorcyclist Glenn Curtiss, fastest man in the world, whose aerial challenge to Wilbur Wright culminated in an unforgettable showdown over New York harbor.  To Conquer the Air is a hero's tale of overcoming obstacles within and without that plumbs the depths of creativity and character. With a historian's accuracy and a novelist's eye, Tobin has captured the interplay of remarkable personalities at an extraordinary moment in our history. In the centennial year of human flight, To Conquer the Air is itself a heroic achievement.",

Pryor was Barley's commander in one of the bloodiest of all Civil War battles. And Pryor was killed in battle in 1864, more than five years ago. His body was found and buried.So why is Barley so sure it's Pryor he sees in the remote town of Baddock? And, stranger still, why is Barley Newton found dead soon after the mysterious encounter?Back in Washington, officials at the War Department want some answers. It is almost unheard of for an officer to desert his troops. If Pryor, a West Point man, is indeed still alive, he must be apprehended and punished for the traitor he is. But Pryor has clearly taken a new name and identity and may be difficult to locate now that Barley Newton is dead.Captain Thomas Maynard, traveling incognito, is sent west to investigate.",

        "Title": "The Wind Done Gone: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Randall, Alice",
        "Description": "In a brilliant rejoinder and an inspired act of literary invention, Alice Randall explodes the world created in Margaret Mitchell\u2019s famous 1936 novel, the work that more than any other has defined our image of the antebellum South. Imagine simply that the black characters peopling that world were completely different, not egregious, one-dimensional stereotypes but fully alive, complex human beings. And then imagine, quite plausibly, that at the center of this world moves an illegitimate mulatto woman, and that this woman, Cynara, Cinnamon, or Cindy -- beautiful and brown -- gets to tell her story.Cindy is born into a world in which she is unacknowledged by her plantation-owning father and passed over by her mother in favor of her white charges. Sold off like so much used furniture, she eventually makes her way back to Atlanta to take up with a prominent white businessman, only to leave him for an aspiring politician of her own color. Moving from the Deep South to the exhilarating freedom of Reconstruction Washington, with its thriving black citizenry of statesmen, professionals, and strivers of every persuasion, Cindy experiences firsthand the promise of the new era at its dizzying peak, just before it begins to slip away.Alluding to events in Mitchell\u2019s novel but ingeniously and ironically transforming them, THE WIND DONE GONE is an exquisitely written, emotionally complex story of a strong, resourceful black woman breaking away from the damaging world of the Old South to emerge into her own, a person capable of not only receiving but giving love, as daughter, lover, and mother. A passionate love story, a wrenching portrait of a tangled mother-daughter relationship, and a book that gives a voice to those history has silenced, THE WIND DONE GONE is an elegant literary achievement of significant political force and a novel whose time has finally come.",

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\"  So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness.",

His assignment: the argument against it.What's a good Catholic to do when a task sets the two great directives of his upbringing - to affirm his faith, and to perform well in the classroom - in opposition? Young Edward's solution would foretell his future as a performing storyteller who recalls with affection the challenges of growing up Catholic.Stivender's first book, Raised Catholic (Can You Tell?), focused on his elementary years, set in Philadelphia in the 1950s, cocooned by institutions - the family, the church, manifest destiny - unchanged for decades, if not centuries.In his newest book, Edward enters adolescence, and his body is not the only thing changing. A Catholic is elected President, then killed. The reforms of Vatican II begin to seep into the Philadelphia Archdiocese. His father, a Navy man, is deployed most of the time. His mother takes a job. And in a cycle of twelve autobiographical stories, Stivender details with wit, humor and precision a faith journey through the obstacles these changes impose.",

At its center is a young boy who grows into a man and his grandfather - irascible, scrappy Herman \"Rocky\" Goodstein - who takes over a troubled family at the age of 103 and shows them all how to survive, how to heal, and how to love.Rocky seems to have been looking out for his grandson Max all his life. A Jewish immigrant from Lithuania, the five-feet-tall, 110 pound Rocky ends up as a baker in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and has already been forced into semiretirement by the time Max is born. He is, however, no gentle old man. He argues with the men in the synagogue, screams daily at his fellow workers in the bakery, and explodes in anger in his sleep, calling down curses in Yiddish on his enemies - everyone from the Bolsheviks to Richard Nixon.Grandpa Rocky and Max share a house, a heritage, an extended family and eventually a special bond as the fiery old man shapes and guides a little boy's growth into manhood. But neither quite expects to end up together as roommates during the turbulent 1960s when Max goes to the University of Michigan and Rocky is a hale and hearty 93. And neither could foresee how their lives would continue to be intertwined in years to come.In these times of radical change, it is old-fashioned love that causes the most trouble. Debby, a feisty and bright young woman, immediately steals Max's heart and arouses Rocky's instant dislike, winning him over only after becoming Max's wife and the mother of his two children.Then tragedy strikes; Max helplessly watches his world fall apart; and a very old man whose own thoughts are finally turning toward death discovers he has a new job. Grandpa Rocky, 103, takes over running a family with all the strength of character and wisdom about the sorrows and joys of living that more than a century has taught him. And in doing so, he touches and inspires us all, no matter what our age, in this tough-and-tender true story of an American family.",

It would rock the country - and her life - that's what!Updating the story of Lysistrata - who persuaded the women of Athens to withhold sex from their husbands to end a war - Anne O.Faulk has written a Rabelaisian cautionary tale.Lauren Fontaine is a thirty-six-year-old financial wizard and single mother with a wicked wit and a tenacious sense of right and wrong. Like many other women, she is outraged when the wife of the chief justice of the Supreme Court commits suicide after years of spousal abuse - and the \"good old boys\" in Congress refuse to impeach the offender.When Lauren suggests that every woman in America refuse to have sex until the judge is removed from the court, her proposed sex strike sweeps the nation, and she soon finds herself pitted against almost every man in the country - and unwittingly placed at the center of the most controversial event in the history of the women's movement.Through it all, Lauren must come to terms with her own burgeoning (and perforce sexless) relationship with a handsome, world-famous writer, as well as her changing assumptions about women. She must deal with a financial scandal in her own office, the problems of her son as his mother becomes a national heroine, and the consequences, ranging from funny to tragic, for the women around her of her sex strike - all without losing her sense of humor.",

        "Title": "The New Middle East",
        "Authors": "By Peres, Shimon and Naor, Arye",
        "Description": "The late-summer headlines of a landmark peace accord between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization stunned and delighted citizens of conscience from every walk of life and from all over the world. Here, at last, were the first glimmerings of harmony for a region whose bloody, intractable conflicts between Arab and Jew had outlived hot and cold wars alike to become an inescapable, insoluble fact of life in our modern age.Many men and women of peace and vision worked together to bring about this epoch-making accord, but none played a more prominent and crucial role than Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, and former Prime Minister, Shimon Peres. Using both behind-the-scenes statecraft and the very public platform of the international media, Peres has called for nothing less than a total transvaluation of our thinking about the future of the Middle East. Peace, he has argued eloquently, is the only alternative for Jews and Arabs poised on the verge of a new century, and a new millennium. Peace will come only as the result of compromise. Peace is the only way to prevent posterity from making the same terrible mistakes of preceding generations.In The New Middle East Peres offers a compelling vision of the future for his region. He sees a reconstructed Middle East, free of the conflicts that plagued it in the past, set to take its place in a new era - an era that will not tolerate backwardness or ignorance. He sees a social revival, and an economic revival as well - one fueled by the billions upon billions of dollars wasted for decades on defense. But crucially, he is not fixated only on what might be. He offers a no less cogent analysis of how peace can be achieved. He seeks nothing short of a historic new chapter between two peoples: to end a hundred years of hostility, and to begin a hundred years of peace and understanding.The New Middle East is a blueprint for the dawning of a new age. A visionary manifesto of current events no one can afford to ignore, it also may become one of the enduring political documents of our time.",

She must rescue her brother Bill, a novice lawyer, from charges of fraud and a rather nasty jail term... and try to reconcile her parents, who are unaccountably ending their marriage of more than twenty-five years. (When Elizabeth is away things do fall apart!)A group of charming old ladies living in the Home for Confederate Women had hired Bill to sell the antebellum mansion in which they'd lived for decades, insisting that he put everything in his own name and handle the unpleasant business as quietly as possible. But after the sale, the dear ladies are nowhere to be found, the money has been deposited into a numbered account in the Cayman Islands, and, as it turns out, the mansion had already been sold to the Virginia Society for Art and Antiquities as a museum.As her parents demand divorce and the authorities aim for Bill's head, Elizabeth rallies to save the family honor. And in her spare time she solves a puzzle from the past that has again reared its sinister head: the legendary mystery of the missing Confederate treasury - two million dollars in gold - whose last known location was in the vicinity of Danville.",

This was too peculiar to ignore, so Breslin decided to pay a rare visit to his doctor.As it turned out, the eyelid was a matter of nerves. But extensive testing revealed something unrelated and life-threatening: he had an aneurysm in his brain - a thin, ballooned artery wall that could burst and kill him at any moment unless he opted for a risky surgical procedure. Breslin agreed to the surgery and at age sixty-five, grateful for this miracle (what else could you call it?), began taking stock of his remarkable life.",

        "Description": "At a time when the word \"politics\" is highly charged, and the meaning of \"Republican\" is the subject of a fight between openly warring factions, Governor Christie Whitman's clear centrist vision - a direct legacy from her family - has attracted national attention and acclaim.

Growing Up Republican was written with the full cooperation of Governor Whitman and includes her own introduction. The governor provided Patricia Beard with exclusive uncensored access to family documents, letters, and photos, and offered Beard unusual exposure to her current public and private lives; the result is an intimate, unvarnished look at a woman who has lived her entire life in the political arena.Growing Up Republican provides an illuminating look at the roots of Whitman's powerful potential political acumen. It is a revealing portrait of the way character intersects with policy and politics in the life of a woman whose deeply rooted philosophy about public service propels her vision of the future.",
