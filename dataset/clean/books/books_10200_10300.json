        "Description": "Conceived with dazzling insider's knowledge of cutting-edge medical research, The Magic Bullet propels us relentlessly along on a hunt for the elusive miracle cure for cancer.  Harry Stein's spellbinding new thriller is set on the dark edge of American medicine, where human fife takes a backseat to greed, ambition, and the bottom line. At 31, Dr. Daniel Logan has gotten the biggest break of his career--a research fellowship at the American Cancer Institute near Washington, D.C.  The patients who come here know it is their last hope for survival, and they willingly take drugs that are shrouded in secrecy...even when things begin to go very, very wrong.  Soon Dr. Logan learns that he has no influence on the arrogant, world-famous researchers who give the orders, and no hope that anyone will listen when he stumbles upon the \"magic bullet,\" a possible miracle cure--for breast cancer.  The reason: a conspiracy so deadly and unconscionable that he cannot believe it's real until his life becomes a nightmare-and time begins to run out for one very special patient: the most prominent woman in American politics. Featuring passionate young doctors desperate for the glory of a cancer cure, deadly sabotage, betrayal, and a lethal medical conspiracy, Harry Stein's \"what-if' premise is hair-raising...shocking...the stuff of an instant bestseller.  The fear is real.  The medical facts are authentic...and the cure?  You'll be held spellbound finding out.",

        "Authors": "By Hansen, Brooks",
        "Description": "In the fall of 1900, Dr. Gustav Uyterhoeven left the chess garden that he and his wife, Sonja, had created together in Dayton, Ohio, and journeyed to South Africa to serve as a doctor in the British concentration camps of the Boer War. Over the next ten months he sent twelve chess pieces and twelve letters back to Sonja. She set out her husband's gifts as they arrived and welcomed all the most faithful guests of the garden to come and hear what he had written - letters which told nothing of his experience of the camps but described an imagined land called the Antipodes, where all the game pieces that cluttered the sets and drawers of the garden collection came to life to guide the doctor through his fateful and wondrous last adventure.Brooks Hansen offers a tale of spiritual progress disguised in the most exotic visions of the imagination. And yet The Chess Garden encompasses a very real world, too. Alongside the doctor's visions of the Antipodes, the story of his life gradually unfolds as well. History and allegory are expertly woven until finally both lead back to the chess garden itself, a place where ideas give way to vision, reason meets faith, and fact and figment are finally reconciled.",

That's why they drag Marina and Jed to join the reverend's flock at a mountain retreat. From the mountaintop they will all watch the Righteous Conflagration that will end this world--and then they will descend and begin the world anew. But this world has only just begun for Jed and Marina, two teenagers with more attitude than faith. Why should the world end now, when they've just fallen in love? Told in alternating chapters from both Jed's and Marina's points of view, this first-ever collaboration between two masters of children's literature is a story about faith and friendship, love and loss . . . and the things that matter most at the End of the World.",

It's a multimedia extravaganza, and if Soleil hadn't been coerced into participating, she would never have imagined herself sleeping on display while hundreds of people stream by - especially when she discovers that Andy McKey, the mastermind behind Dreamscape and the man she once loved, is the one who will be monitoring her dream world.Soon Soleil's unease turns to terror as her dreams relentlessly take her into the life of a young girl born sixty years earlier. \"Shoe\" Arnett is twelve, an orphan whose face was ruined in an accident, left alone in the harsh world of a Depression-era farm.

But the brutality of the streets and a series of violent deaths and deadly misunderstandings shock him into seeing how limited his influence has been.In a complex, fast-paced narrative, several richly nuanced voices weave a powerful, deeply effecting story of possibility - hopeful and dangerous - between people whose connection is often defined only by its impossibility.",

        "Title": "Revelation: St. John the Divine's Prophecies for the Apocalypse and Beyond",
        "Authors": "By Lorie, Peter",
        "Description": "The Book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, has been an enigma to Christian theologians since it was written shortly after the Crucifixion. John of Zebedee, Jesus' closest disciple, wrote the book following a divinely inspired vision of an angel sent by God, and the result has long been seen as perhaps the most dramatic prophetic work ever to predict the future of mankind.As we draw close to the end of the millennium - the time many believe will herald the Last Judgment and possibly an apocalyptic end-of-the-world scenario - Peter Lorie brings an entirely fresh and hopeful interpretation of Revelation and the future it declares. Through a unique analysis of this extraordinary religious book, previously hidden material and symbolism are revealed, such as references to astrology, paganism, eastern philosophy, numerology, magic, shamanism and most of all, prophecy.In studying the lines of Revelation, the author brings to light the seven stages of man's evolution, stages that take us all through joy, crisis and self-discovery to an age in the future which St. John describes as the new Jerusalem, and which the author interprets as a world filled with beauty and enlightenment. Some of the predictions that Lorie makes for our future include: a female president in the United States, a new world order for the 21st century, and a beginning of 1,000 years of peace.The Book of Revelation has tended in the past to strike fear into humanity, but through Peter Lorie's ground breaking interpretation, this fear and trepidation is transformed into a positive understanding of ourselves and the world we inhabit.",

A Citizens' Fire Watch is formed, and volunteers go out on shifts to patrol areas of concern, particularly the old minesites, which have been rumored to contain subterranean fires deep within. When a volunteer is murdered near the Big B minesite, which had been set ablaze, the people of Pickax realize they are dealing with both an arsonist and a killer. And Koko, Siamese cat extraordinaire and owner of journalist James Qwilleran, knows even more than that, as evidenced by his suspicious scrutiny of an antique pitcher, a batik of robins, and an old-fashioned glove box.The string of catastrophes continues as a local builder dies in an apparent accident, and it's up to Qwilleran & Co. to trap the rat who's behind it all.",

        "Description": "Here is a passionate, gutsy exploration of the generation of women who came of age during the women's movement, coupled with the author's very personal story of her later-in-life attempts to have a baby.Unable to conceive naturally, and heading toward forty, journalist Anne Taylor Fleming availed herself of a veritable alphabet soup of the latest, cutting-edge fertility procedures: GIFT, ZIFT, IVF... Spurred by her present consuming desire to bear a child, Fleming's thoughts return to the past - her heady college days, her 1950s youth - in an effort to discover how she has arrived at this juncture in her life.Alternating between an insightful probe of those volatile years when the personal became political, and a harrowing account of her often surreal forays into extrasexual procreation, Motherhood Deferred is an unsparing portrait of a generation of women born to one set of gender-inspired expectations, who were then expected to flourish under an entirely different set. The result is a braid of powerful and telling testimonies - the author's and those of her contemporaries - chronicling the vicissitudes in opportunities, dreams, and realities for women whose lives were movement-forged.With understanding, sensitivity, and self-deprecating humor, Anne Taylor Fleming has written a tour de force: a sometimes irreverent account of what it has meant to be female in the last half of the twentieth century.",

On their second night out, the tables are turned: one of the bears comes looking for them. Daybreak finds the boy missing and a camper dead, her neck snapped, the flesh of her face cut away.

        "Description": "This is the biggest, grandest, most sprawling epic ever told, filled with battles and hardship, courage, determination, daring voyages into the unknown, and eye-opening discoveries...From the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of FDR, Winston Churchill, and Somerset Maugham, Wilderness At Dawn is the sprawling, roughhouse epic of the unsung heroes, heroines, and rogues who tamed the rugged continent that became our country. Here is a masterpiece of history, research, and storytelling, the panoramic epic of the North American continent and the vast array of characters who thought they could civilize it. Concentrating on those previously ignored by \"polite histories\" (ordinary settlers, unknown soldiers, scalawags, pioneer women, slaves, and Native Americans), Morgan uses scenes and dialogue from actual letters, journals, and diaries to recreate the odysseys, adventures, human dramas, and inhuman suffering that shaped America.Beginning with prehistoric man's first forays across the Bering Land Bridge, Morgan unfurls a rich tapestry of lost civilizations and Indian accomplishments; ambitious explorers, would-be politicians and transplanted Europeans confronting the wilderness; scrappy newborn towns and dandified plantation societies; great river navigations and catastrophic explorations; the bloody Indian wars and the birth of the American revolution. All are here - the triumphs, tragedies, battles and intrigues from the Ice Age when Early Man roamed an empty continent to the achievement of the all-American dream of \"Land for Every Man.\"Morgan takes us into the world of the lost Anasazi people, where inventive Indians built houses of 500 rooms, veritable \"cities of stone\" tucked among the canyon walls. He takes us into the lives of the Indians of the Southwest where a shipwrecked Spanish explorer named Cabeza de Vaca became an indentured servant (and later medicine man) to a tribe of Indian fishermen. We see the arrival of the first Jews in North America, the harsh hierarchies of the Puritans, the intricacies of the rice planter societies of the early 1700s in Carolina.Enriched by Ted Morgan's own visits to most of the sites he describes, enlivened by the actual words of characters such as the circuit-riding minister Charles Woodmason, the freed slave Thomas Jeremiah, the frontiersman Christopher Gist and the plantation manager Eliza Lucas, Wilderness At Dawn is a lively world of rich historical storytelling and adventure.",

Shortly thereafter Covert-One director Fred Klein brings the word to the President that there\u2019s a Chinese cargo ship rumored to be carrying tons of chemicals to be used by a rogue nation to create new biological weapons. The President cannot let the ship land and risk the consequences of a new stockpile of deadly chemical weapons. Klein is ordered to get the President solid proof of what the Chinese ship is ferrying. Covert-One agent Jon Smith is sent to rendezvous in Taiwan with another agent who has acquired the ship\u2019s true manifest. But before Smith can get the document, the two agents are ambushed, the second agent is murdered, the proof is destroyed, and Smith escapes with only his life, scant clues to mystery behind the cargo ship, and a verbal message---the President\u2019s biological father is still alive, held prisoner by the Chinese for fifty years. As the Chinese cargo ship draws ever closer to its end port, Smith must race against the clock to uncover the truth about the ship and its cargo, a truth that probes the deepest secrets of the Chinese ruling party, the faction in Washington working to undermine the elected government, and the international cabal who is thrusting the world to the very brink of war.",

        "Title": "Move Without the Ball: Put Your Skills And Your Magic To Work For You",
        "Authors": "By Graham, Stedman",
        "Description": "Athletics is a metaphor for life; that's why Move Without the Ball is not just for athletes. Anyone who has ever been involved in the pursuit of excellence understands the need for dedication, perseverance, and sacrifice. Everyday, young adults are bombarded with images and stories of extreme wealth and fame -- be it in sports, music, or Hollywood. Their vision of success can become limited to these areas, and they lose focus on developing other talents and skills. A reality check is in order, because the odds are fifty thousand to one that a student athlete will play in the NBA, and similar odds apply to aspiring singers and actors who expect they will be the next superstar. The upside is that there is a much bigger world out there for young people to explore and succeed in, and Move Without the Ball serves as the guidebook.  Stedman Graham -- businessman, lecturer, and author of the New York Times bestsellers Teens Can Make It Happen and You Can Make It Happen -- speaks honestly and directly to teens from his own experience. A former European professional athlete who never achieved his dream of playing in the NBA, Graham understands the pressures and temptations young people face. He discovered that there is a process for building success in many areas of one's life, and he has spent the last twenty years sharing this process with young people.  The book overflows with powerful and inspiring stories and photographs of sports stars of yesterday and today, including Hank Aaron, Greg Norman, Magic Johnson, Mia Hamm, Pel\u00e9, Dave Winfield, Serena Williams, Bo Jackson, and Cal Ripken Jr. -- just to name a few. It's not just these pros' athleticism that's highlighted in Move Without the Ball, it's the winning combination of courage, self-discipline, sense of purpose, and passion that they bring to their lives everyday -- both on and off the field.",

        "Description": "\"When we got towards Ellis Island the boat slowed down and oh, I felt better and I was happy. When we saw Miss Liberty I can't tell you the feeling that we had. We were so happy, we started to sing. We sang Hungarian, but I'll translate it in English: 'In America life is golden. In America it's never dark. In America there's lots of money. In America the girl is happy. In America the flowers are more beautiful. In America the world is much better. In America living is golden. And that's where I'm longing to be, my dear.'\" --Renee Berkoff, Hungarian, at Ellis Island in 1922Ancestors of nearly one half of all the people living in the United States today came to America through the immigration port of Ellis Island. Like the Statue of Liberty, the faces on Mt. Rushmore, and the San Francisco Bay Bridge, Ellis Island has come to represent the expansive spirit of the nation, a symbol of its identity.To commemorate the major restoration of this historic site, Aperture celebrates the 27 1/2-acre monument in Upper New York Bay with a book of vibrant photographs and words-- Ellis Island: Echoes from a Nation's Past. With historical and new pictures from some of the best photographers of our time-- including Lewis Hine, Alfred Eisenstaedt, Jerry Uelsmann, Larry Fink, and others-- and excerpts from oral histories, Ellis Island reverberates with the excitement and drama of the millions of immigrants who were welcomed to America through its doors. Specially commissioned essays by Norman Kotker, Shirley C. Burden, Charles Hagen, and Robert Twombly evoke the feeling of the past and attest to the island's pivotal significance in the nation's history.Images by Lewis Hine, Augustus Sherman, and Edward Levick document the peak years of immigration. Alfred Eisenstaedt, Shirley C. Burden, and Joel Greenberg are among those who capture the years of the island's decline and abandonment. The restoration process and the lure of Ellis Island have been photographed by Sandi Fellman, Zeke Berman, Nancy Goldring, Larry Fink, Madoka, Geanna Merola, Lorie Novak, Jan Staller, Roger Mertin, Mariana Cook, Sylvia Plachy, Emmet Gowin, Klaus Schnitzer, Robert Sennhauser, Ed Grazda, Christopher Barnes, and others.In 1984, Ellis Island was closed to allow massive reconstruction. After a six-year hiatus, this entry point to America between 1892 and 1954 reopened to the public, bringing with it a renewed interest in our rich multi-ethnic, multi-racial heritage. It is estimated that fifteen million people explore the park each year. With 45 four-color and 115 black-and-white duotone photographs.Ellis Island accompanied a major exhibition selected and organized by Klaus Schnitzer of Montclair State College and Brian Feeney of the National Park Service.",

They, after all, had led a revolution against a succession of royal Georges.   In this devastating book, onetime Republican strategist Phillips reveals how four generations of Bushes have ascended the ladder of national power since World War One, becoming entrenched within the American establishment\u2014Yale, Wall Street, the Senate, the CIA, the vice presidency, and the presidency\u2014through a recurrent flair for old-boy networking, national security involvement, and political deception. By uncovering relationships and connecting facts with new clarity, Phillips comes to a stunning conclusion: The Bush family has systematically used its financial and social empire\u2014its \"aristocracy\"\u2014to gain the White House, thereby subverting the very core of American democracy. In their ambition, the Bushes ultimately reinvented themselves with brilliant timing, twisting and turning from silver spoon Yankees to born-again evangelical Texans. As America\u2014and the world\u2014holds its breath for the 2004 presidential election, American Dynasty explains how it happened and what it all means.",

        "Authors": "By Kwitney, Alisa",
        "Description": "After going for more than a year without a date -- a record in New York City -- Marlowe Riddle has finally met a broodingly sexy, sharply intelligent man who is clearly interested in making more than polite conversation. The only problem: Joseph Kain is an NYPD detective clearly under the mistaken impression that Marlowe is a call girl.But while Marlowe does take money for spending time with strangers in her expensive Upper West Side apartment, she's a psychologist -- not Manhattan's answer to the Mayflower Madam! A fact she has no intention of telling Joe ... at least not until she finishes her research project on the \"Behavioral Effects of Disguising Identity.\"But Marlowe's not the only one trying to secretively gain information ... and it's becoming increasingly unclear who is seducing whom. Because sometimes the only way to learn what a man really wants ... is to get him on the couch.",

        "Description": "The destruction of the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the attack on the Pentagon -- all within one hour on September 11, 2001 -- demonstrated America's shocking vulnerability to terrorism.Yet terror had already emerged on America's shores eight years earlier, when the mysterious terrorist mastermind, Ramzi Yousef (arrested after a botched attempt to down a dozen U.S. airlines) bombed the World Trade Center in an attempt to fell the buildings.  His attacks were viewed as the harbinger of a new terrorism, carried out by an elusive enemy driven by religious fanaticism to unprecedented hatred of the United States.But is that perception accurate? A real-life detective story, The War Against America engages the reader in a gripping examination of the evidence regarding Yousef and his terrorism.  It reveals the split between New York and Washington that emerged during the investigation and tells a terrifying tale of America left exposed and vulnerable following the mishandling of what was once the most ambitious terrorist attack ever attempted on U.S. soil.",

Now the supernova's residual effect--a storm of high-energy particles--is racing toward Earth, and an international effort has been launched out of the Sky City space colony to save the planet. But the controversial plan--to build a giant protective shield for Earth--is falling dangerously behind schedule. A series of unexplained murders has disrupted the Sky City workforce, so much so that a brilliant but monstrous criminal has been enlisted to track down the Sky City killer.Then comes more startling news. Evidence indicates that the original supernova was caused deliberately, and that the lethal particle storm will arrive sooner than anyone expected. But who--or what--tried to destroy the Earth? And will the answer come in time to save it from its final apocalypse?",
