        "Authors": "By Whitlock, Sarah and Rankin, Martha",
        "Description": "To make a beautiful arrangement of dried flowers, all you need to have are fresh flowers in various colors, forms and shapes; a selection of berries, seed pods, grasses, and foliage; and a knowledge of how to dry each plant item properly and efficiently. In a very short time, this book will teach you how to dry flowers by the hanging method and the surrounding and covering method, as well as giving you tips on storage, arranging flowers, and more.Within the past few years a great deal has been learned about dehydrating flowers so that effects are possible that our ancestors never dreamed of. The most sensational development has been the introduction of silica gel, the best of all materials now in use for drying flowers, and the authors give complete instructions on how to mix and use it. They also give instructions for using other mediums \u2014 meal and borax, perlite aggregate (crushed volcanic rock), and sand and borax \u2014 as well as using glycerin and water for drying foliage in three dimensions. This is probably the largest number of techniques ever given in a small volume.Also included are two valuable reference lists: a list of flowers arranged according to color, and a list of 48 flowers and 35 other plant items giving recommended method of drying and other useful information. Beginners will love this book and the way flowers look after being dried with modern techniques, while even experienced workers will find much helpful advice on specific flowers and methods.",

        "Title": "Bombingham: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Grooms, Anthony",
        "Description": "From the war-torn rice fields of Vietnam to the riot-filled streets of Birmingham, Alabama, Bombingham is the affecting story of a middle-class black family riven by its personal chaos. When Walter Burke is faced with writing a letter to the parents of a fallen friend and fellow soldier, he is taken back to his childhood amidst the Civil Rights Movement. From it, he recalls the segregated city, the fledgling movement, and the momentous responsibility to act.  Walter reflects on how he and his family were challenged by the swelling resistance to the horrific realities of segregation in a city where little girls could be bombed in church and their fathers jailed for just looking at a white person in the wrong way. The parents' sense of security is increasingly threatened, while the children are forced to make moral decisions that portend grave consequences.  As Walter struggles to make sense of his presence in Vietnam, he wonders if the victory of the movement meant nothing more than being sent into a battlefield of another kind. Joining two pivotal periods in the American experience, this beautifully written novel from the winner of the 1996 Lillian Smith Award for Fiction makes an important contribution to our understanding of the period. With wry humor and haunting description, it is a portrait of the wonder and the terror of childhood in a time when ordinary citizens risked their lives to change America. By turns both reflective and dramatic, Grooms chronicles the events of the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War through the heightened perspective of a narrator who struggles to find the meaning of his role in both events. Bombingham is a moving testament to the power of responsibility and faith in the face of tragedy.",

In Animal Underworld, veteran investigative journalist Alan Green exposes the sleazy, sometimes illegal web of those who trade in rare and exotic creatures. Green and The Center for Public Integrity reveal which American zoos and amusement parks dump their \"surplus\" animals on the middlemen adept at secretly redirecting them into the private pet trade. We're taken to exotic-animal auctions, where the anonymous high bidders are often notorious dealers, hunting-ranch proprietors, and profit-minded charlatans masquerading as conservationists. We visit some of the nation's most prestigious universities and research laboratories, whose   diseased monkeys are \"laundered\" through this same network of breeders and dealers until they finally reach the homes of unsuspecting pet owners. And we meet the men and women who make their living by skirting through loopholes in the law, or by ignoring the law altogether. For anyone who cares about animals; for pet owners, zoo-goers, wildlife conservationists, and animal   welfare advocates, Animal Underworld is gripping, shocking reading.",

        "Title": "I Am the New Black",
        "Authors": "By Bozza, Anthony and Morgan, Tracy",
        "Description": "The outrageously funny, heartbreaking, and surprising story of Tracy Morgan's rise from ghetto wiseass to superstar comedian.Who is Tracy Morgan? The wildly unpredictable funnyman who rocketed to fame on Saturday Night Live? The Emmy-nominated actor behind the sly and ingenious character Tracy Jordan on the award-winning hit sitcom 30 Rock, whose turbulent personal life often mirrors that of his fictional alter ego? Is he Chico Divine, the life of the party\u2013any party, anytime, anywhere\u2013getting ladies pregnant everywhere he goes? Or is he a soulful, tender family man who emerged from a hardscrabble ghetto upbringing and, against all odds, achieved superstardom, raised a solid family, prevailed over a collection of lethal bad habits, and is still ascending new heights and coming into his own? The answer is: Tracy Morgan is all that. And a bag of potato chips with a 50\u00a2 soda.When he was just a boy living in the Tompkins Projects in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, being funny was about survival. With the right snap, Tracy could shut down the playground bullies who picked on him and his physically disabled older brother. And with a wild enough prank, he could exact revenge on whoever stole his Pumas at the community pool. Later, being funny was about escape\u2013from the untouchable sadness of his father's death, from the desperation of the drug dealer's trade, from the life-and-death battles waged on the streets of the South Bronx in the age of crack. But these days being funny is about living his dream\u2013a dream born in the comedy clubs of Harlem and realized on shows like Martin and Saturday Night Live, where he was a cast member for seven years, and in movies like The Longest Yard and Half-Baked. With brutal honesty and his trademark take-no-prisoners humor, Tracy tells the story of his rise to fame, with all its highs and its many lows\u2013from the very public battles with alcohol and diabetes that threatened both his career and his life to the private and poignant end of his twenty-year marriage. In his singularly warped and brilliant way he muses on family, love, sex, race, politics, ambition, and what it takes to bring the funny.Hilarious, inspiring, searing, and touching, I Am the New Black is a fascinating peek inside the minds of one of the most compelling and defining comedians of our time.",

        "Description": "For the past half century, John Keegan, the greatest military historian of our time, has been returning to the scenes of America\u2019s most bloody and wrenching war to ponder its lingering conundrums: the continuation of fighting for four years between such vastly mismatched sides; the dogged persistence of ill-trained, ill-equipped, and often malnourished combatants; the effective absence of decisive battles among some two to three hundred known to us by name. Now Keegan examines these and other puzzles with a peerless understanding of warfare, uncovering dimensions of the conflict that have eluded earlier historiography.While offering original and perceptive insights into psychology, ideology, demographics, and economics, Keegan reveals the war\u2019s hidden shape\u2014a consequence of leadership, the evolution of strategic logic, and, above all, geography, the Rosetta Stone of his legendary decipherments of all great battles. The American topography, Keegan argues, presented a battle space of complexity and challenges virtually unmatched before or since. Out of a succession of mythic but chaotic engagements, he weaves an irresistible narrative illuminated with comparisons to the Napoleonic Wars, the First World War, and other conflicts. The American Civil War is sure to be hailed as a definitive account of its eternally fascinating subject.",

One by one the mighty cities are falling, to earthquakes, to flood, to raiders on both land and sea. In a time of war and doubt, Gull is an oracle. Daughter of a slave taken from fallen Troy, chosen at the age of seven to be the voice of the Lady of the Dead, it is her destiny to counsel kings. When nine black ships appear, captained by an exiled Trojan prince, Gull must decide between the life she has been destined for and the most perilous adventure -- to join the remnant of her mother's people in their desperate flight. From the doomed bastions of the City of Pirates to the temples of Byblos, from the intrigues of the Egyptian court to the haunted caves beneath Mount Vesuvius, only Gull can guide Prince Aeneas on his quest, and only she can dare the gates of the Underworld itself to lead him to his destiny.

        "Description": "\u201cIt was the happiest moment of my life, though I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d So begins the new novel, his first since winning the Nobel Prize, from the universally acclaimed author of Snow and My Name Is Red. It is 1975, a perfect spring in Istanbul. Kemal, scion of one of the city\u2019s wealthiest families, is about to become engaged to Sibel, daughter of another prominent family, when he encounters F\u00fcsun, a beautiful shopgirl and a distant relation. Once the long-lost cousins violate the code of virginity, a rift begins to open between Kemal and the world of the Westernized Istanbul bourgeosie\u2014a world, as he lovingly describes it, with opulent parties and clubs, society gossip, restaurant rituals, picnics, and mansions on the Bosphorus, infused with the melancholy of decay\u2014until finally he breaks off his engagement to Sibel. But his resolve comes too late. For eight years Kemal will find excuses to visit another Istanbul, that of the impoverished backstreets where F\u00fcsun, her heart now hardened, lives with her parents, and where Kemal discovers the consolations of middle-class life at a dinner table in front of the television. His obsessive love will also take him to the demimonde of Istanbul film circles (where he promises to make F\u00fcsun a star), a scene of seedy bars, run-down cheap hotels, and small men with big dreams doomed to bitter failure. In his feckless pursuit, Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of objects that chronicle his lovelorn progress and his afflicted heart\u2019s reactions: anger and impatience, remorse and humiliation, deluded hopes of recovery, and daydreams that transform Istanbul into a cityscape of signs and specters of his beloved, from whom now he can extract only meaningful glances and stolen kisses in cars, movie houses, and shadowy corners of parks. A last change to realize his dream will come to an awful end before Kemal discovers that all he finally can possess, certainly and eternally, is the museum he has created of his collection, this map of a society\u2019s manners and mores, and of one man\u2019s broken heart.A stirring exploration of the nature of romantic attachment and of the mysterious allure of collecting, The Museum of Innocence also plumbs the depths of an Istanbul half Western and half traditional\u2014its emergent modernity, its vast cultural history. This is Orhan Pamuk\u2019s greatest achievement.",

        "Description": "\"These are the stories that came to me to be told after the close of a magical marriage to an extraordinary man that ended in a less-than-magical divorce. I found myself unmoored, unmated, ungrounded in a way that challenged everything I'd ever thought about human relationships. Situated squarely in that terrifying paradise called freedom, precipitously out on so many emotional limbs, it was as if I had been born; and in fact I was being reborn as the woman I was to become.\"So says Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker about her beautiful new book, in which \"one of the best American writers today\" (The Washington Post) gives us superb stories based on rich truths from her own experience. Imbued with Walker's wise philosophy and understanding of people, the spirit, sex and love, The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart begins with a lyrical, autobiographical story of a marriage set in the violent and volatile Deep South during the early years of the civil rights movement. Walker goes on to imagine stories that grew out of the life following that marriage\u2014a life, she writes, that was \"marked by deep sea-changes and transitions.\" These provocative stories showcase Walker's hard-won knowledge of love of many kinds and of the relationships that shape our lives, as well as her infectious sense of humor and joy. Filled with wonder at the power of the life force and of the capacity of human beings to move through love and loss and healing to love again, The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart is an enriching, passionate book by \"a lavishly gifted writer\" (The New York Times Book Review).",

        "Title": "Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression",
        "Authors": "By Kalish, Mildred Armstrong",
        "Description": "I tell of a time, a place, and a way of life long gone. For many years I have had the urge to describe that treasure trove, lest it vanish forever. So, partly in response to the basic human instinct to share feelings and experiences, and partly for the sheer joy and excitement of it all, I report on my early life. It was quite a romp.So begins Mildred Kalish\u2019s story of growing up on her grandparents\u2019 Iowa farm during the depths of the Great Depression. With her father banished from the household for mysterious transgressions, five-year-old Mildred and her family could easily have been overwhelmed by the challenge of simply trying to survive. This, however, is not a tale of suffering.Kalish counts herself among the lucky of that era. She had caring grandparents who possessed\u2014and valiantly tried to impose\u2014all the pioneer virtues of their forebears, teachers who inspired and befriended her, and a barnyard full of animals ready to be tamed and loved. She and her siblings and their cousins from the farm across the way played as hard as they worked, running barefoot through the fields, as free and wild as they dared.Filled with recipes and how-tos for everything from catching and skinning a rabbit to preparing homemade skin and hair beautifiers, apple cream pie, and the world\u2019s best head cheese (start by scrubbing the head of the pig until it is pink and clean), Little Heathens portrays a world of hardship and hard work tempered by simple rewards. There was the unsurpassed flavor of tender new dandelion greens harvested as soon as the snow melted; the taste of crystal clear marble-sized balls of honey robbed from a bumblebee nest; the sweet smell from the body of a lamb sleeping on sun-warmed grass; and the magical quality of oat shocking under the light of a full harvest moon.Little Heathens offers a loving but realistic portrait of a \u201chearty-handshake Methodist\u201d family that gave its members a remarkable legacy of kinship, kindness, and remembered pleasures. Recounted in a luminous narrative filled with tenderness and humor, Kalish\u2019s memoir of her childhood shows how the right stuff can make even the bleakest of times seem like \u201cquite a romp.\u201d",

Bosco, a seasoned crime journalist, is that rare thing - an unpuffed-up writer with no ax to grind. He simply tells the crime story as he sees it, and proves - beyond any doubt - that the prosecution bungled the case.He takes us with him into the courtroom where he sat every day of the trial and introduces us to the full cast of characters. In a series of remarkable vignettes and close-up impressions, we watch them in action - for better and worse. We see what television did not show. We measure the real evidence and the real actors after all the spin, deception, and lies. And in exclusive interviews, about material never before revealed, we hear from Dr. Henry Lee, the country's leading forensic scientist; Pat McKenna, private investigator for the defense; Dr. Mark Goulston, psychiatrist who consulted for the prosecution; and Peter Bozanich, assistant Los Angeles district attorney.",

There is no aspect of twentieth-century culture\u00ad\u00adincluding the arts, social sciences, philosophy, and politics\u00ad\u00adthat has not been profoundly influenced by them.In Great Ideas in Physics, Alan Lightman clearly explains the physics behind each of the four great ideas and deftly untangles for lay readers such knotty concepts as entropy, the relativity of time, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Throughout the book he uses excerpts from the writings of scientific luminaries such as Newton, Kelvin, Einstein, and de Broglie to help place each in its proper historical perspective. And with the help of expertly annotated passages from the works of dozens of writers, philosophers, artists, and social theorists, Lightman explores the two-way influences of these landmark scientific concepts on our entire human culture and the world of ideas.",

        "Description": "First published in 1977, this popular book has become the source on film and media. Now, James Monaco offers a revised and rewritten third edition incorporating every major aspect of this dynamic medium right up to the present.Looking at film from many vantage points, How to Read a Film: Movies, Media, Multimedia explores the medium as both art and craft, sensibility and science, tradition and technology. After examining film's close relation to such other narrative media as the novel, painting, photography, television, and even music, Monaco discusses those elements necessary to understand how films convey meaning and, more importantly, how we can best discern all that a film is attempting to communicate.In a key departure from the book's previous editions, the new and still-evolving digital context of film is now emphasized throughout How to Read a Film. A new chapter on multimedia brings media criticism into the twenty-first century with a thorough discussion of topics like virtual reality, cyberspace, and the proximity of both to film. Monaco has likewise doubled the size and scope of his \"Film and Media: A Chronology\" appendix. The book also features a new introduction, an expanded bibliography, and hundreds of illustrative black-and-white film stills and diagrams. It is a must for all film students, media buffs, and movie fans.",

There are lists of what to look for and what NOT. And plenty of advice on separating the keepers and how to throw the others back.

Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself.Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines.The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness.In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.Written with acclaimed science writer Sandra Blakeslee, On Intelligence promises to completely transfigure the possibilities of the technology age. It is a landmark book in its scope and clarity.",

The final section, now called \"Film: Psychology, Society, and Ideology\" is substantially revised to take into account film's relationship to its consumers: how films shape or reflect cultural attitudes, reinforce or reject dominant modes of cultural thinking, and stimulate or frustrate people's needs and drives. Throughout the book chapter introductions have been rewritten to reflect today's concerns. Current and comprehensive, the book that The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism called \"the best collection available on the disparate comments in the fields of film theory and criticism\" is now even better.",

        "Description": "From the time he made hordes of hysterical fans swoon at the Paramount in 1942 up until the present day, Frank Sinatra has never been out of the public spotlight. With some 1,800 recordings, 60 film credits, two Oscars, numerous Grammys and a Grammy Legends Award, and the undying loyalty of millions of fans around the world, Sinatra has become an American hero. Songs sung by the Italian-American phenomenon, such as \"New York, New York,\" \"My Way,\"\"Fly Me to the Moon,\" and \"That's Life\" are now among the undisputed classics of American popular music. In The Frank Sinatra Reader, Leonard Mustazza and Steven Petkov have brought together for the first time a singular selection of writings about the famous singer that focuses on his music and his legendary voice. A unique anthology of reviews, photographs, and memoirs, many of them back in print for the first time in decades, this collection tells the story of Sinatra's extraordinary musical career from its inception to the present. We see Sinatra as a teen phenomenon and follow his rise and fall as a solo performer, his comeback as a mature recording artist with Capitol Records, and his reign as a powerful and influential personality in the '60s. Lastly, the book contemplates Sinatra's ability to endure and triumph in a changing musical world. Included among the prominent writers, musicians, and journalists that recount and applaud the star's progress through the twentieth century are Henry Pleasants, Arnold Shaw, Stephen Holden, Gay Talese, Whitney Balliet, Gene Lees, Bill Boggs, Will Friedwald, and William Kennedy. Readers will also find intimate recollections by writers who knew not only the musician but the man himself, such as those by Pete Hamill, Jonathan Schwartz, and Rosalind Russell. The editors provide introductions to each section, a selected discography, a complete filmography, as well as a biographical chronology of the author's life and a selected bibliography. In The Frank Sinatra Reader, the man and his music become inseparable as the reader develops a greater understanding and appreciation of both. Mustazza and Petkov have created an invaluable collection that both illuminates and reflects Sinatra's incredible impact on the American cultural landscape. It is a must read for all Sinatra fans and for anyone interested in popular music and culture.",
