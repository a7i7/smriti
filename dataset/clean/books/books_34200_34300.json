        "Title": "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything - by Steven D. Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner",
        "Authors": "By Levitt, Steven D. and Dubner, Stephen J.",
        "Description": "Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics. Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan. What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter. Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.",

        "Description": "In the tradition of the megabestseller The Millionaire Next Door, Eight Steps to Seven Figures brings together in-depth interviews with over two hundred everyday people whose investments have made them millionaires. But while The Millionaire Next Door describes its subjects' lifestyles and spending habits, Eight Steps to Seven Figures focuses squarely on the investing strategies and principles that ordinary people have used to achieve the magic million-dollar mark.Bestselling author and chartered financial analyst (CFA) Charles Carlson reveals the keys used by the newly wealthy to reap extraordinary dividends, including a discussion of the specific stocks, bonds, and other financial vehicles they choose as part of their investment mix. In the course of the book, readers learn how to determine how much time they need to spend researching and watching over their portfolios, when to buy, and equally important, when to sell. From hundreds of accounts of those Carlson calls \"Main Street millionaires,\" he distills eight specific investment rules anyone can follow to become financially worry-free. Among the lessons he outlines and elaborates on: \"Buy and Hold and Buy and Hold and Buy and Hold\"--Harness the power of time in growing your portfolio and compounding your investment returns. \"Know Where You Are Going\"--Determine your invest\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ment time frame, financial goals, and risk \"comfort\" level to put together a successful wealth-building strategy. \"Play to Your Strengths\"--Everyone has different personality strengths, investment advantages, and specialized knowledge that they bring to the table; recognize and exploit them in achieving your financial goals.One of the best things about Carlson's book is that it recognizes and allows for readers who may not have the resources to follow all eight rules. It offers reassurance and hope that there is more than one way to achieve the seven-figure pinnacle. Even people who started investing later in life, and can't fully harness the power of time, can find here the guidance they need to become wealthy.Filled with the insights and investment advice that hundreds of everyday people have followed to become rich, and buttressed with countless you-are-there stories of how these millionaires did it, Eight Steps to Seven Figures is an absolute must for today's investors.Bestselling author and chartered financial analyst (CFA) Charles Carlson reveals the keys used by the newly wealthy to reap extraordinary dividends, including a discussion of the specific stocks, bonds, and other financial vehicles they chose as part of their investment mix.

        "Description": "There has never been a more exciting time to explore the pleasures of fine wine. Thanks to a new generation of talented winemakers who are marrying the best of traditional viticulture with innovative technologies, today premium wine is being produced in more places, giving the consumer an unprecedented array of choices in every price range.Dennis Overstreet, whose store, The Wine Merchant, Beverly Hills, has been a Los Angeles fixture for more than twenty years, feels wine has for too long been veiled in a shroud of elitism and arcane language. As one of the foremost wine retailers in the country, he is on a mission to show would-be connoisseurs at every level of sophistication how to increase their enjoyment of wine and challenge their palates with new experiences.Unlike other wine guides, Overstreet's does not offer ratings; instead he provides road signs that help guide readers through a thrilling journey of discovery of their own. He introduces some of the most important people and places in the wine world today, and offers pointers on searching out intriguing, little-known wines. He then goes on to break down what exactly we mean when we say a wine is good--or even great--so readers can expand their wine vocabulary and communicate their preferences more effectively. And because he believes there is no substitute for popping corks--that is, tasting, tasting, and more tasting--he provides guidelines for starting a wine collection and organizing a wine tasting at home or in a restaurant. Overstreet also addresses the often-tricky business of matching wines with food, drawing on the expertise of some of the country's foremost sommeliers and chefs, and shares his recommendations for getting the most from a wine retailer or restaurant wine list. And in an extensive directory of wines and winemakers by country, Dennis Overstreet offers his highly subjective nominations for the world's best wines.Filled with insights gleaned from a life dedicated to the appreciation of this intriguing and rewarding beverage, Overstreet's New Wine Guide will help novices and experts alike derive more pleasure from their wine and encourage them to expand their horizons with every bottle.Dennis Overstreet, California's premier wine merchant, presents his shortcuts to making every glass a moment worth savoring, spotlighting the most exciting new names and places in wine today. He shows how to: spot wines that are beyond their prime, stock a wine cellar, host a wine tasting, build a relationship with a wine retailer, seek out little-known vintages and makers, get the best service from a sommelier, pair wine with a variety of foods, and much more. Overstreet also includes his exclusive hit list, The Wine Merchant's Selections, of best bottles from around the world.",

The ringing of her cell phone was no exception. On the other hand, the request to meet the next evening held promise: The caller not identifying herself was just mysterious enough to make it interesting. If she couldn't sleep at night, Rachel thought, maybe a mystery would liven things up. And since she had no idea at all of where this meeting would lead, it certainly qualified as something to investigate.She found out where she was going soon enough: Her caller was a transvestite hooker, one of the many who work New York's old meat packing district on the lower West Side. Someone was killing the girls, and they knew, through experience, that the cops wouldn't be there to help them. In short order, Rachel finds herself not only transformed, but on the stroll, walking streets deserted except for johns on bitter cold nights when every whispered sound is a threat.She also discovers that Dash isn't the right dog for one job she has to do, and that she has to turn a long-haired dachshund into a burglar to get the answers she needs, answers she couldn't even begin to imagine in the unimaginable world she's entered.",

It is the decade of Joe McCarthy and the young Martin Luther King, the Korean War and Levittown, Jack Kerouac and Elvis Presley.Halberstam not only gives us the titans of the age - Eisenhower, Dulles, Oppenheimer, MacArthur, Hoover, and Nixon - but also Harley Earl, who put fins on cars; Dick and Mac McDonald and Ray Kroc, who mass-produced the American hamburger; Kemmons Wilson, who placed his Holiday Inns along the nation's roadsides; U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers; Grace Metalious, who wrote Peyton Place; and \"Goody\" Pincus, who led the team that invented the Pill. Here is a portrait of a time of conflict, at once an age of astonishing material affluence and a period of great political anxiety.We follow, among other things, the quickening pace of American life and the powerful impact of national television, still in its infancy, on American society: from the Kefauver hearings to I Love Lucy to Charles Van Doren and the quiz-show scandals to the young John Chancellor of NBC covering the Little Rock riots and holding up a disturbing mirror to America.",

Indeed, it seemed to be quite the opposite. In brilliantly skewering such na\u00efvet\u00e9, Voltaire mercilessly exposes and satirizes romance, science, philosophy, religion, and government \u2014 the ideas and forces that permeate and control the lives of men.After many trials and travails, Candide is reunited with Cunegonde, his sweetheart. He then buys a little farm in Turkey where he and Cunegonde, Dr. Pangloss and others all retire. In the end, Candide decides that the best thing in the world is to cultivate one's own garden.

        "Title": "The Oxford Companion to English Literature, Fifth Edition",
        "Authors": "By Drabble, Margaret. and Harvey, Paul H.",
        "Description": "Sir Paul Harvey's original Oxford Companion to English Literaure, published in 1932, was the book that began Oxford's celebrated Companion series.  In its various editions in the half-century since then, it has enjoyed an enormously faithful following and unflagging sales (over 400,000 to date).  Now, for the Fifth Edition, the eminent novelist and biographer Margaret Drabble has put together the most substantial and significant revision in the book's distinguished history.  The Classic Guide to English Literary Culture    Here, thoroughly updated, is the standard reference work on English literature, both clasic and contemporary.  The virtues established by Harvey are intact: the useful plot summaries, the separate entries on important fictional characters, the countless biographical articles on authors and other important figures in the world of letters, the lightness of touch that makes the book a pleasure to read. As ever, this is an essential book for libraries large and small, for students, for teachers, for everyone interested in English literature.  Revisions Deepen and Widen Book's Appeal    Drabble's revisions not only bring the volume up to date; they both deepen and widen its appeal.  Topics once regarded as non-literary--detective stories, science fiction, children's literature, comic strips, for example--are now included, as are numerous foreign language authers who have become well-known in translation.  There are also entries on composers who have adapted English texts to musical forms and articles on visual artists whose work has been touched by the English literary consciousness.  The book covers all the important movements and critical theories (including the latest developments in Freudian and Marxist criticism and Saussurean linguistics and its successors).  What is more, the entries on classic works--Beowulf, The Canterbury Tales, The Faerie Queen, and many others--now incorporate the findings of the latest scholarship.  In still another innovation, the entries now offer the reader a guide to turther study and research by referring to the relevant biographies, memoirs, critical studies, and standard scholarly editions of many of the important works.  Also, the book's appendices on censorship, copyright, and the calendar have been updated, and an exhaustive cross-referencing system in the manner of the more recent Companiions has been adopted.  About the Editor:  Margaret Drabble's many books include The Middle Ground, The Realms of Gold, The Ice Age, Thank You All Very Much, and A Writer's Britain.  Standard Features: Among the many notable features distinguishing The Oxford Companion to English Literature are:  \u00b7 Alphabetically arranged entries \u00b7 Entries on important individual works \u00b7 Author entries that include concise biographical information and cite their major works \u00b7 Many entries on historians, critics, philosophers, and booksellers \u00b7 Coverage of many American authors and of foreign language authors famous in translation \u00b7 Entries on non-literary figures famous in a literary context, from Penelope Rich to Ottoline Morrell \u00b7 Articles on literary societies, clubs, and coffee houses \u00b7 Definitions of literary and artistic movements, from Existentialism to the New Criticism, from Neo-classicism to Structuralism \u00b7 Entries on prizes, periodicals, newspapers, and literary agents \u00b7 Updated appendices on censorship, copyright, and the calendar \u00b7 Extensive system of internal cross references, redesigned in the manner of the more recent Companions",

        "Description": "It's an amazing tale - how the movement to follow Jesus survived, grew, and in the end captured the very soul of the mighty Roman Empire. Really two books in one, After Jesus tells the dramatic story of early Christians and of the times in which they lived.Follow Paul and the other Apostles as they carry the word of Jesus throughout the known world; see what it was like to live in Jerusalem, Corinth, Alexandria, and other centers of early Christianity; witness persecutions, martyrdoms, and church ransackings that seemed only to fuel the fire of faith; observe the intrigues of imperial Rome and its slow decline into economic ruin and chaos; listen in on debates that nearly split the church just as it was becoming a respected power.Thrillingly told and beautifully illustrated, After Jesus brings you face to face with the men and women who lived during the years from Jesus' death until A.D. 600.Stunning reconstructions put you on the scene of such dramatic events as the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 and the conversion of Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus; glorious photographs - more than 300 of them - show you the lives and aspirations of people in these stories through paintings, sculptures, and articles used in their rituals and daily lives; fascinating maps depict the spread of Christianity and the movements of the barbarians who helped hasten the fall of Rome; intriguing charts document such key events as the assembling of the New Testament; beautiful art portfolios bring you stirring paintings from the Roman catacombs, treasures of the Byzantine era, and finely crafted artifacts of the pagans.Easy to read, awe-inspiring to contemplate, After Jesus is a book your whole family will turn to again and again.",

        "Authors": "By Black, Cathleen",
        "Description": "Cathie Black is the wise, funny mentor that every woman dreams of having. She was a pioneer in advertising sales at a time when women didn\u2019t sell; served as president and publisher of the fledglingUSA Today; and, in her current position as the president of Hearst Magazines, persuaded Oprah to launch a magazine. In 2006 she was named one of Fortune\u2019s \u201c50 Most Powerful Women in American Business\u201d for the seventh consecutive year. Now, in the exuberant, down-to-earth voice that is her trademark, Cathie explains how she achieved \u201cthe 360\u00b0 life\u201d\u2014a blend of professional accomplishment and personal contentment\u2014and how any woman can seize opportunity in the workplace.No matter where you are in your career, Basic Black offers invaluable lessons that will help you land the job, promotion, or project you\u2019re vying for. At the core of the book are Cathie\u2019s candid, personal stories. She walks us through her decision to risk dropping a huge ad agency that handled the USA Today campaign in favor of a small boutique agency run by a wild man. (It was a smash.) She admits that her sometimes brusque style once led to a mutiny of staffers at Ms. (She learned to be more flexible in her managerial style.) She offers a clear-eyed look at what happened during the twenty-eight months between the launch and the close of the much-buzzed-about Talk magazine. And throughout, she offers fascinating glimpses of media and business personalities, such as Rupert Murdoch, Tina Brown, Frank Bennack, Vic Ganzi, formerCosmoGirl! editor Atoosa Rubenstein, Bonnie Fuller, and the legendarily difficult Al Neuharth, founder ofUSA Today.Above all, Basic Black is motivating. It provides a close-up look at the keen judgment, perseverance, and optimism that have propelled Cathie Black to the top of her game, along with the kind of straight-up practical advice you get in a one-on-one session with a career coach. You\u2019ll find out how to handle job interviews, which rules to break, and why you should make your life a grudge-free zone. Equally important, you\u2019ll be inspired to pursue your passions and achieve your very best.",

        "Title": "Jews: The Essence and Character of a People",
        "Authors": "By Hertzberg, Arthur and Hirt-Manheimer, Aron",
        "Description": "What makes a Jew a Jew? In the most controversial book on Jewish identity to come along in decades, two influential Jewish leaders dare to answer that provocative question. There is an essential Jewish identity, shaped by the legacy of history and faith, which bridges divergent cultures, politics, and even beliefs. So argues author Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, the outspoken and influential leader at the forefront of the world Jewish community, who together with Aron Hirt-Manheimer, the distinguished editor of Reform Judaism magazine, presents a myth-shattering view of Jewish character.Jews is a landmark work that provocatively explores the meaning of Jewish identity through the ages. Hertzberg and Hirt-Manheimer present an original and insightful look at the entire Jewish experience and what it means for Jews and non-Jews alike. The authors boldly advance a series of radical arguments:  They dare to define the \"essential\" Jew. They dare to say that the Jewish character has remained the same since the time of Abraham and Sarah. They dare to propose that anti-Semitism is not a Christian invention-it is a reaction to Jews as persistent dissenters in every society. They dare to suggest that the Holocaust was a reenactment of the Crucifixion in which the traditional roles were reversed. They dare to examine the illness of self-hatred that has afflicted Jews from Karl Marx to Woody Allen.This book offers a new and startling perspective on how Jews relate to people of other traditions while also defining the challenge, responsibility, and essence of being a Jew in our time. Jews: The Essence and Character of a People defies the conventional view of Jews that has prevailed for centuries and presents a compelling and realistic portrait of contemporary Jews. This important book is sure to stimulate passionate debate among both Jews and non-Jews.",

        "Description": "John Updikes's nineteenth novel tells the story of Claudius and Gertrude, King and Queen of Denmark, before the action of Shakespeare's Hamlet begins. Employing the nomenclature and certain details of the ancient Scandinavian legends that first describe the prince who feigns madness to achieve revenge upon his father's slayer, Updike brings to life Gertrude's girlhood as the daughter of King Rorik, her arranged marriage to the man who becomes King Hamlet, and her middle-aged affair with her husband's younger brother. A dark-eyed dreamer with a taste for foreign adventure, he for decades has sought to quell his love for Gertrude, and at last returns to an Elsinore whose prince is generally elsewhere. Gaps and inconsistencies within the immortal play are to an extent filled and explained in this prequel; the figure of Polonius, especially, takes on a larger significance. Beginning in the aura of pagan barbarism, and anticipating Renaissance humanism and empiricism, this modern retelling of a medieval tale presents the case for its royal couple that Shakespeare only hinted at. Gertrude and Claudius are seen afresh against a background of fond intentions and familial dysfunction, on a stage darkened by the ominous shadow of a sullen, disaffected prince.",

Initially reluctant, Foster set a four-hour time limit for placing the first strange dog he brought into his New York City apartment, only to discover that this would be the first of many dogs who would seemingly choose him to lead them, one way or another, to their new home. You''ll meet:--Sinatra, a blue-eyed collie found tied beneath a New York City bench.--Zephyr, a rottweiler who jumps from a pickup on a Florida highway. --Katrina, a nearly autistic yard dog abandoned after her owners'' divorce. --An 85-pound pit bull found greeting customers at a truck stop on Valentine''s Day. --An abused border collie discovered wandering a designer outlet mall.--A puppy left on Manhattan''s East River, and the social worker that sought the dog''s return to her homeless clients.--And finally, Sula, who returned to her abandoned birthplace after surviving a vicious dog fight.In addition to the personal stories, The Dogs Who Found Me offers expert advice and answers the essential questions: How should you approach an abandoned dog? How do you integrate a temporary animal guest into your household? What resources are available in your area? Are some dogs beyond rescue? Why do some dogs fear your help? Should we ever give up on a dog?Part memoir, part how-to, The Dogs Who Found Me is a moving and practical portrait of the national community of dog rescuers, foster homes, and the dogs who found them.",
