        "Authors": "By Quandt, William B. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Within the Middle East, the Camp David Accords are the subject of great debate. Many in the Arab world, and even some in Israel, regard them with hostility. Others, especially in the United States, see in the Camp David formula the only hope for successful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict and lavish praise on the accords. But the broad impact of the accords on the Middle East and on the prospects for peace has never been fully analyzed by Middle Eastern or American specialists. This new work, published to mark the tenth anniversary of the accords, offers the comprehensive assessment necessary to discuss the next steps in the Middle East peace process.Now more than ever Americans need to understand how the Camp David Accords affected the entire Middle East region?not just Egypt and Israel?to deal with the complexities of future peace efforts. The authors provide an analytical basis for understanding the intricate links among domestic political forces, regional politics, and superpower policies as elements in the Arab-Israel peace process. By examining the past, the authors also show how to clarify choices that may confront Israelis and Arabs as they continue to work toward a settlement of their longstanding dispute.",

        "Description": "For this book, the late Pierre Franey---originator of the popular \"60-minute Gourmet\" column for The New York Times, author of thirteen books, and star of the popular PBS cooking shows \"Cuisine Rapid,\" \"Cooking in America,\" and \"Cooking in France\"--traveled throughout Europe, cooking with seventeen friends. All are top chefs or restaurateurs who have recognized the need to cook in a lighter, healthier way, both for their costumers and for themselves. In France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, these chefs combine moderate amounts of butter, cheese, and oil with fresh local produce and masterful combinations of herbs to create healthy, satisfying, and delicious food. Among Franey's friends were Paul Bocuse, Michel Guerard, and Marc Meneau in France; Fredy Girardet in Switzerland; Pierrs Wynants of Comme Chez Soi in Belgium; and Antonio Belles of the tapas bar in the Hotel Arts in Barcelona. These world-famous chefs provide both classic and innovative recipes, such as Bocuse's Black Bass with a Potato Crust, and Guerard's Pan con Tomate, a staple of Catalonian cuisine. Franey contributed some one hundred of his own health-conscious recipes, inspired by watching his friends cook and visiting their local markets. These include such tempting dishes as Spicy Shrimp and Squid Salad, Penne with Baby Spinach and Fresh Peas, and Sauteed Apples in Calvados.  The result of Franey's journey is an international sampling of delicious health-conscious cooking from great European chefs and from Graney himself, who was one of America's most loved culinary figures.",

        "Description": "The end of the U.S.-Soviet standoff and the increasing risk of political adventurers such as Saddam Hussein developing nuclear capability have profoundly altered the shape of global nuclear danger.In Reducing Nuclear Danger, three of America's top experts on nuclear affairs offer a thoughtful prescription for effective international action to cut existing nuclear arsenals and to prevent further proliferation. They argue that the United States must take a cooperative leadership role to achieve worldwide control of nuclear weapons. The immediate tasks to this end are to execute the already agreed-upon reductions in U.S. and Russian forces, ensure that Russia remains the only nuclear state of the former Soviet Union, and substantially strengthen the international efforts against the spread of nuclear weapons.The authors favor adopting a strict doctrine of using nuclear weapons only as a \"defensive last resort,\" along with other specific changes in current policy. Prominent in their prescriptions is an eventual drastic reduction of the current Russian-American warhead ceilings. They also advocate a new policy for American leaders - toward other nations as well as the American people - of open public explanation of nuclear danger.This important and insightful book on the current nuclear danger should be read by all citizens with an interest in resolving what remains our greatest global risk, at a time of unprecedented opportunity.",

        "Title": "Any Given Day: The Life and Times of Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux",
        "Authors": "By Foveaux, Jessie Lee Brown",
        "Description": "Her childhood was idyllic: fishing by moonlight, dressing her cats in doll clothes, stealing apples from the orchards planted on the Western frontier. Slim, lively Jessie Lee dreamed a little girl's dreams in an exquisitely remembered world of one-room schoolhouses, snowy Christmases, and a family that survived scarlet fever and floods with the power of love.But for Jessie Lee, as for the nation, World War I put an end to those years of innocence. She lost her beloved fiance and mother in one year. She eventually married a man she didn't love and bore him eight children. Then, as her husband sank deeper and deeper into alcoholism, she carried the brunt of raising them on her own - selling products door-to-door with her youngest children by her side, and fighting debt and dishonor with hard work and the loving help of family and friends. As time went on, and Jessie Lee broke with convention to find a job and get a divorce, she also found it in her heart to forgive the husband who had disappointed her, take responsibility for her own mistakes, and pass the insights of a long lifetime down to her children and grandchildren.Her message is inspiring: that life is about meeting our challenges...and that extraordinary courage can be found inside ordinary lives, wisdom resides behind every elderly face, and everyday heroes and heroines stand beside us within our own American families.",

Enlightened Leadership is a practical, hands-on guide to breaking through the barriers to organizational change. Doug Krug and Ed Oakley show why most efforts at change fail -- and they provide leaders with proven methods for getting their people moving in the right direction.  The key lies in showing those who would be change agents how to capitalize on their organization's greatest asset: the under-utilized talent, expertise, and energy of its existing staff. The authors' program is based on maximizing the contributions of all employees -- by sharing information, decision-making, and planning with them -- creating a shared culture of organizational goals, strategies, and methods.  Managers and leaders at all levels -- from small business owners to corporate strategists -- can use Oakley and Krug's proven techniques, including planning, communication, and motivational tools, to support their employees in effecting the positive changes that will make the difference in achieving their organizations' bottom-line goals.",

And the wisdom this creature offers the disenchanted thinker goes far beyond anything known or imagined in Goethe's day: the secrets of flight and the cosmos, the principles of economics and engineering, the mysteries of medicine and the atom.And so begins Faust's transition from madman to savior - from Johannes to Jack - as he accelerates human progress at blinding speed, setting the mighty gears and pistons of industry in motion to first remake Germany, and then all Europe, in his own image. Ushering in a New Age of Mechanization hundreds of years before its rightful time, he is alternately adored and despised for his accomplishments, as he attempts to elevate humankind from the muck of ignorance, superstition and disease.Yet it is love that damns Jack Faust and, ultimately, humanity as well. For Mephistopheles has revealed to him the beauty and purity of innocence in the person of Margarete Reinhardt, the daughter of a struggling businessman. To win her heart, Faust will give Margarete power and influence in an age when women are powerless - and fame in a time when notoriety can be fatal - and, in the process, blind his beloved, and himself, to the horrors Faust's \"progress\" has wrought.",

He's met with wild-eyed meteorologists who are obsessed with finding out exactly why hurricanes occur and how to predict their onslaughts more accurately. And he's joined heroic aid teams as they've coped with the physical and emotional devastation left in the wake of these awesome storms.In Inside the Hurricane, Davies sweeps readers from the Caribbean to the Bay of Bengal, describing both the horrifying violence and the eerie beauty of hurricanes. He explains the weather conditions that foster them; discusses in lucid detail how scientists predict, measure, and track them; and delves into mysteries scientists are still trying to solve. Gripping accounts of the greatest hurricanes in history climax with Davies's own firsthand experiences flying into the worst storms of 1999.  A masterful combination of history, science, and adventure, Inside the Hurricane leaves readers with a chilling reminder of nature's enduring domination over man: scientists predict that the hurricanes of tomorrow will make today's Category 5 storms look small.",

Written with lyricism and emotional authenticity, Altar Music is a portrait of a nun as a young girl, an epic tale of a family both defined and divided by its religious beliefs, and a powerful story about mothers and daughters.",

Why did the defense know from the beginning that they had at least a hung jury, and why was Simpson told he was going home even before the verdict came down? Why was Simpson's reputation more important to him than whether he was convicted? How did Simpson's team stage an elaborate deception during the jury's visit to his Rockingham mansion? What did a leading forensic psychiatrist discover about O.J. during his face-to-face examination? Why was Johnnie Cochran afraid to return to Simpson's holding cell during final arguments? You've heard the speculations and rumors; now read what really happened.But American Tragedy goes far beyond such revelations, for in these pages the reader will discover who Simpson really is and why he is able to insist upon his innocence even to this day.",

A year later, in Moscow, an officer in the security service of the new Russian Federation is ordered to find a rogue agent of the former KGB, Andrei Orlov, who has disappeared without a trace.These apparently unconnected events are followed by the arrival in Berlin of American art historian Francesca McDermott, recruited to organize a major retrospective exhibition of Russian experimental art, a priceless gathering of the greatest Russian paintings of the twentieth century that communism had dismissed as \"decadent.\" Working with Francesca is a Russian expert, Serotkin - attractive and mysterious, but a chauvinist whose ideas for the exhibition invariably conflict with Francesca's. Gradually, despite their reluctance, the two high-minded academics are drawn together.Brilliantly cast in the form of a post-Cold War thriller, The Patriot catches the political and moral turmoil in Moscow after the failed coup against Gorbachev, and in Berlin after the fall of the Berlin Wall. At once richly dramatic and morally complex, it is a novel about love, faith, and patriotism, and the stark choices that must be made when these emotions and ideals conflict.",

        "Description": "The assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 continues to be shrouded in mystery and controversy. In Plausible Denial, Mark Lane, the author of Rush to Judgment, the provocative and bestselling critique of the Warren Commission, reveals startling evidence about the CIA\u2019s involvement in a plot to murder the president.In 1978, when a small magazine ran a story by CIA renegade Victor Marchetti linking ex-CIA operative and convicted Watergate burglar E. Howard Hunt to the assassination, Hunt sued for defamation. Lane signed on as defense counsel for the publication, and set out to prove the truth of the allegations against Hunt and the CIA. Lane\u2019s investigation uncovered a web of conspiracy that involved anti-Castro Cubans, Watergate conspirators, and public officials at the highest levels of the intelligence community. The forewoman of the jury, Leslie Armstrong, stated that ?Mr. Lane was asking us to do something very difficult. He was asking us to believe that John Kennedy had been killed by our own government. Yet when we examined the evidence, we were compelled to conclude that the CIA had indeed killed President Kennedy.\u201dMeticulously documented and compellingly written, this book makes public the contents of this curiously unpublicized trial, the only jury verdict directly related to the theory that the CIA was involved in the assassination.",

And how Ollie North was involved.Terry Waite was an obscure Anglican envoy until his unexpected diplomatic skills and successes in effecting the release of hostages in the Middle East thrust him onto the world stage.Dressed in his black clerical robes, with a wooden cross around his neck, the tall, bearded envoy took on Iranian revolutionaries face to face. He managed to persuade Libya's Colonel Qadaffi to release hostages. And his gradual, growing involvement with the Americans held captive in the Middle East made him a celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic.Why, then, was this effective emissary of the Church of England suddenly kidnapped in Beirut in January of 1987? What had the revolutionaries suspected? How had the U.S. government used him? What happened? Why? At last, the real story about Terry Waite can be revealed. Based on meticulous research and yielding convincing evidence, this book brilliantly provides the answers--unexpected answers, at that, to what Waite was doing in the Middle East, why he was kidnapped, what was really going on.It is a gripping, informative, and important story of personal courage, of integrity tested, and of political duplicity, told rigorously and responsibly by journalist Gavin Hewitt.",

        "Title": "Hollywood Vs America: Popular Culture and the War on Traditional Values",
        "Authors": "By Medved, Michael",
        "Description": "Why does our popular culture seem so consistently hostile to the values that most Americans hold dear? Why does the entertainment industry attack religion, glorify brutality, undermine the family, and deride patriotism?In this explosive book, one of the nation's best known film critics examines how Hollywood has broken faith with its public, creating movies, television, and popular music that exacerbate every serious social problem we face, from teenage pregnancies to violence in the streets.Michael Medved powerfully argues that the entertainment business follows its own dark obsessions, rather than giving the public what it wants: In fact, the audience for feature films and network television has demonstrated its profound disillusionment in recent years, with disastrous consequences for many entertainment companies. Meanwhile, overwhelming numbers of our fellow citizens complain about the wretched quality of our popular culture - describing the offerings of the mass media as the worst ever. Medved asserts that Hollywood ignores - and assaults - the values of ordinary American families, pursuing a self-destructive and alienated ideological agenda that is harmful to the nation at large and to the industry's own interests.In hard-hitting chapters on \"The Attack on Religion,\" \"The Addiction to Violence,\" \"Promoting Promiscuity,\" \"The Infatuation with Foul Language,\" \"Kids Know Best,\" \"Motivations for Madness,\" and other subjects, Medved outlines the underlying themes that turn up again and again in our popular culture. He also offers conclusive evidence of the frightening real-world impact of these messages on our society and our children.Finally, Medved shows where and how Hollywood took a disastrous wrong turn toward its current crisis, and he outlines promising efforts both in and outside the industry to restore a measure of sanity and restraint to our media of mass entertainment.Sure to elicit strong response, whether it takes the form of cheers of support or howls of enraged dissent, Hollywood vs. America confronts head-on one of the most significant issues of our times.",

        "Description": "Jocasta Innes's The New Decorator's Handbook is the complete guide to decorating your home by magically transforming walls, floors, and furniture with glorious colors and the remarkable paint effects for which the author is celebrated.In her room-by-room approach, Innes leads readers by the hand through each important phase of home decoration, from the important early stages of assessing the rooms, choosing the right tools, estimating costs, and prioritizing tasks to the exciting stage of decorating itself. Such straightforward techniques as creating a Scandinavian checkered pattern over old floorboards, applying gloss to a fireplace, transforming iron garden ware into stylish furniture, and replacing old wallpaper with simple stenciling are clearly illustrated with four-color line art, atmospheric photographs, and Innes's sensible instructions.As lovely and inspirational as it is practical and easy to use, The New Decorator's Handbook is an invaluable resource for all do-it-yourself home decorators.",
