His mastery of hard science, his fearlessly speculative imagination, and his ability to combine grand philosophical questions with tales of rousing adventure make him essential reading for anyone concerned with the future of humankind. Now, in Exultant, Baxter takes us to a distant future of dazzling promise and deadly threat, in which a far-flung humanity battles for survival against an implacable alien foe.Destiny\u2019s ChildrenEXULTANTFor more than twenty thousand years, humans have been at war with the alien race of Xeelee. It is a war fought with armaments so advanced as to be godlike, a war in which time itself has become an ever-shifting battleground. At the cost of billions of lives, and with ruthless and relentless efficiency, the ruling Coalition has pushed the Xeelee back to the galactic core, where the supermassive black hole known as Chandra serves the Xeelee as both fortress and power source. There, along a front millions of light-years long, a grisly stalemate reigns,until a young pilot, Pirius, faced with certain death, disobeys orders and employs an innovative time-travel maneuver that, for the first time in the history of the war, results in the capture of a Xeelee fighter. But far from being hailed as a hero when he returns to base with his prize, Pirius is court-martialed, disgraced, and sentenced to penal servitude on a bleak asteroid.It is not only Pirius who pays the price. In flying into the future and back again, Pirius returned to a time before he\u2019d left, a time inhabited by his younger self. And that younger self, by the pitiless logic of Coalition justice, shares the older Pirius guilt and must be punished. Not everyone in the Coalition agrees. Commissary Nilis believes that the elder Pirius, whom he dubs Pirius Blue, may have found a way to defeat the Xeelee. But Nilis can do nothing for Pirius Blue. Instead, he takes charge of the younger Pirius (Pirius Red), and brings him back to Earth, the capital of a vast empire seething with intrigue.There Pirius Red will discover truths that will shatter his preconceived notions of all that he is fighting for, even of what it means to be human. Pirius Blue, meanwhile, will learn truths harsher and more discomfiting still. Yet the most shocking revelation of all is still to come, waiting for them at a place called Chandra. . . .",

Sooner or later, life\u2019s difficulties bring every Christian woman to God\u2019s doorstep with questions too personal to ignore. \u201cWhy does God let me go through such painful circumstances?\u201d \u201cWhy does he seem indifferent to my prayers?\u201d We\u2019re tired of spiritual pie in the sky. We want authentic, God-as-he-really-is faith\u2014the kind that holds us together when our world is falling apart and equips us to offer strength and hope to others. When Life and Beliefs Collide raises a long-overdue call for us to think seriously about what we believe about God. With passion, brilliance, and eloquence, Carolyn Custis James weaves stories of contemporary women with episodes from the life of Mary of Bethany to illustrate the practical benefits of knowing God deeply. Examining the misperceptions and abuses that discourage women from pursuing a deeper understanding of God, this insightful book demonstrates how practical and down to earth knowing God can be. \u201cThis outstanding book offers the best demonstration that everyone needs theology, the best expository account of Mary and Martha, and the best trajectory for women\u2019s ministry in modern North America that I have yet read.\u201d \u2014James I.

In The Final Solution, he has condensed his boundless vision to create a short, suspenseful tale of compassion and wit that re-imagines the classic 19th-century detective story.In deep retirement in the English countryside, an 89-year old man, vaguely recollected by the locals as a once-famous detective, is more concerned with his bookkeeping than his fellow man. Into his life wanders Linus Steinman, nine years old and mute, who has escaped from Nazi Germany with his sole companion: an African grey parrot. What is the meaning of the mysterious strings of German numbers the bird spews out-a top-secret SS code? The keys to a series of Swiss bank accounts? Or do they hold a significance at once more prosaic and far more sinister?Though the solution to this last case may be beyond even the reach of the once famed sleuth, the true story of the boy and his parrot is subtly revealed to the reader in a wrenching resolution to this brilliant homage. The Final Solution is a work from a master story-teller at the height of his powers.",

After turning forty, Joe Kita set out to relive his top-twenty personal regrets. In Another Shot he recounts his adventures-from the hilarious to the poignant. Dismayed that he may have missed his sexual peak, he convinces his wife to enroll with him in sex camp. Bemoaning the selling of his first love, a powerhouse Camaro, he hires a private detective to find it. Still smarting from the sting of getting cut from his high school basketball team, he convinces his alma mater's coach to let him try out for the squad again-more than twenty years later.  Above all, though, it's Kita's relationships with his family that haunt him. His interaction with his mother has always been strained, and he attempts to understand her by taking her out for a special night. Kita even tries to get in touch with his late father through a medium because he never got to say goodbye. At once witty and profound, Another Shot offers a glimpse into the hopes and worries of a regular guy and speaks to everyone about not letting regrets keep us from enjoying the rest of our lives.",

Will he be able to discover the truth?",

Confronted with a forgetful innkeeper you'll do better than mumble an apology by learning to say Allora dormiamo nella lobby. (\"In that case, we will sleep here in the lobby\"). Forced to wait for your dinner you'll say: Bisogna essere Primo Ministro per essere servito qui? (\"Must one be Prime Minister to get service here?\") Women traveling alone will finally have the phrases they need at their fingertips, such as Contento tu (\"Dream on\"), Guardi che chiamo la polizia (\"I'll call the police\"), and Neanche se fosse l'ultimo uomo sulla terra (\"Not if you were the last man on earth\"). On the other hand, a chapter on \"Making Love\" teaches the delicate language of amore. Wicked Italian is the next best thing to being named Marcello or Sophia. Ciao!",

If pro-lifers are right, innocent children are being robbed of their most basic freedom\u2014life. Though bumpersticker slogans prevail, the facts are rarely presented. We need clear and credible answers to the central questions of the abortion debate. For those who have had abortions or are currently considering one, for pro-choicers and fence-straddlers alike, Why Pro-Life? provides answers to these questions in a concise, straightforward, and nonabrasive manner.Head: Human Life Begins\u2026When?

In a concise, non-abrasive fashion, Randy Alcorn offers compassionate, factual answers to the central issues of the abortion debate.  [Insert Sarah Marie Switzer image] An award-winning photo of an operation on Sarah Marie Switzer, a twenty-four-week unborn child with spina bifida.

We need a clear presentation of what is true. Randy Alcorn has intervened for the unborn and their mothers\u2014and at great personal cost. In writing this book on one of today\u2019s critical issues, he has endeavored to lay out well-supported facts on why the pro-life position is right and true when it comes to valuing human life.",

Soon outlaw bands were ravaging the hill country, while the Trolls disappeared from their icy northern haunts\u2014and none could say where they had gone.

The Prophecy was fulfilled\u2014or so it seemed. While the strange child Erand was growing up in the Vale of Aldur with Plgara and Durnik, showing only occasional flashes of inexplicable knowledge and power, Garion was learning to rule and to be the husband of his fiery little Queen Ce\u2019Nedra. Eleven years passed.Then suddenly the Voice of Prophecy cried out a warning:\u00a0\u201cBeware Zandramas!\u201d Not even Belgarath the Sorcerer knew who or what Zandramas was. But Garion discovered hints in a previously obscured part of the Mrin Codex. Worse, he learned that the Dark Prophecy was still waging its ancient struggle against the Prophecy of Light. Again, a great evil was brewing in the East. And again, Garion found himself a pawn, caught between the two ancient Prophecies, with the fate of the world somehow resting on him.",

Empowerment is the only way to create a win-win situation for the employee and the manager, the company and the customer.",
