In The Breakthrough Company, Keith McFarland pinpoints how everyday companies become extraordinary, showing that luck is a negligible factor. Rather, breakthrough success turns out to be associated with a clearly identifiable set of strategies and skills that anyone in any business can emulate\u2014from small startup to industry leader.Encouraged by experts such as business legend Peter Drucker and Good to Great author Jim Collins to identify the drivers that enable a company to push past the entrepreneurial phase, McFarland spent five years building and analyzing the world\u2019s largest growth-company performance database and interviewing more than 1,500 growth-company executives on four continents.

He started with practically nothing, and made it to Forbes'list of America's Top 100 richest people. Huntsman's generous about sharing the credit, but in the 21st century, he's the nearest thing to a self-made multi-billionaire. Now, he presents the lessons of a lifetime: a passionate, inspirational manifesto for returning to the days when your word was your bond, a handshake was sacred, and swarms of lawyers weren't needed to back it up. This is no mere exhortation: it's a practical business book about how to listen to your moral compass, even as others ignore theirs. It's about how you build teams with the highest values, share success, take responsibility, and earn the rewards that only come with giving back. Huntsman's built his career and fortune on these principles.  You don't live these principles just to 'succeed': you live them because they're right. But in an age of non-stop business scandal, Huntsman's life proves honesty is more than right: it's the biggest competitive differentiator.",

        "Description": "My Life with the Saints 10th Anniversary Edition is available now?! James Martin has led an entirely modern life: from a lukewarm Catholic childhood, to an\u00a0 education\u00a0at the Wharton School of Business, to the executive fast track at General Electric, to ministry as a Jesuit priest, to a busy media career in Manhattan. But at every step he has been accompanied by some surprising friends\u2014the saints of the Catholic Church. For many, these holy men and women remain just historical figures. For Martin, they are intimate companions. \u201cThey pray for me, offer me comfort, give me examples of discipleship, and help me along the way,\u201d he writes. The author is both engaging and specific about the help and companionship he has received. When his pride proves trouble\u00adsome, he seeks help from Thomas Merton, the monk and writer who struggled with egotism. In sickness he turns to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, who knew about the boredom and self-pity that come with illness. Joan of Arc shores up his flagging courage. Aloysius Gonzaga deepens his compassion. Pope John XXIII helps him to laugh and not take life too seriously. Martin\u2019s inspiring, witty, and always fascinating memoir encompasses saints from the whole of Christian history\u2014 from St. Peter to Dorothy Day. His saintly friends include Francis of Assisi, Ignatius of Loyola, Mother Teresa, and other beloved figures. They accompany the author on a lifelong pilgrimage that includes stops in a sunlit square of a French town, a quiet retreat house on a New England beach, the gritty housing projects of inner-city Chicago, the sprawling slums of Nairobi, and a gorgeous Baroque church in Rome. This rich, vibrant, stirring narrative shows how the saints can help all of us find our way in the world. \u201cIn a cross between Holden Caulfield and Thomas Merton, James Martin has written one of the best spiritual memoirs in years.\u201d \u2014Robert Ellsberg, author of All Saints \u201cIt isn\u2019t often that a new and noteworthy book comes along in this genre, but we have reason to celebrate My Life with the Saints. It is earmarked for longevity. It will endure as an important and uncommon contribution to religious writing.\u201d \u2014Doris Donnelly, America \u201cAn account . . . that is as delightful as it is instructive.\u201d \u2014First Things \u201cIn delightful prose Martin recounts incidents, both perilous and funny, that have prompted him to turn to the saints, and in doing so shows us a new way of living out a devotion that is as old and universal as the Church.\u201d \u2014Avery Cardinal Dulles, SJ, Fordham University \u201cAn outstanding and often hilarious memoir.\u201d \u2014Publishers Weekly \u201cMartin\u2019s final word for us is as Jungian as it is Catholic: God does not want us to be like Mother Teresa or Dorothy Day. God wants us to be most fully ourselves.\u201d \u2014The Washington Post Book World",

        "Description": "\"Ingeniously conceived and beautifully wrought, The Tenth Parallel traces the uneasy fault line of two great faiths that have so much bloody history between them. In exploring the potent tensions that underlie so many of the conflicts of the present age, Eliza Griswold gives us a rare look at how complex and interwoven these two cultures actually are.\"\u00f9Lawrence Wright, author of The Looming Tower\"Eliza Griswold's talent runs through this book like a blinding light. Through he; daring travel, quiet observation, empathy, and gift for language, she humanizes and clarifies conflicts in Africa and Asia that are often neglected or misunderstood. The Tenth Parallel is both vitally important and beautifully written.\"-Steve Coll, author of The Bin Ladens\"In this revolutionary work, Eliza Griswold has dedicated the last seven years of her life to traveling in The world's least known places to explore the encounter between Christianity and Islam in Africa and Asia. She has brought back the unforgettable stories of Christians and Muslims along the tenth parallel whose faith is shaping the world's future. Grisworld's courageous pilgrimage changes the way we think about Christianity and Islam by exploring any simplistic 'clash' narrative. She returns us to the most basic truth of human existence: that the world and its people are interconnected.\"-Archbiship Emeritus Desmond M. Tutu\"Eliza Griswold is courageous reporter, a gifted writer, and an acute observer of life. In The Tenth Parallel she takes us on a crucially illuminating tour of some of the most volatile terrain in the world, acquainting us with people who are far away both spatially and culturally but whose fates are intertwined with our own.\"-Robert Wright, author of The Evolution of God\"Based on years of firsthand experience and observation, The Tenth Parallel is a deeply impressive achievement that so often challenges our common assumptions. The book will be immensely rewarding for anyone who wants to make sense of the relationship between those long-estranged sister faiths, Christianity and Islam. It should be required reading for policy makers, and for anyone interested in the spiritual dimensions of the 'clash of civilizations'.\"-Philip Jenkins, author of Jesus Wars\"Seldom does a book of this nature, ranging over such vast terrain, succeed in maintaining a steady focus and an engaging lightness of touch. In Eliza Griswold's hands, Islam resounds through the voice of Muslims, and religions lives through its followers and devotees. The book is a triumph of the human imagination and capacity for intercultural exploration.\"-Lamin Sanneh, author of Whose Religion is Christianity?\"The Tenth Parallel is one of the most important books you will ever read. Eliza Griswold combines the fearlessness of an investigative journalist and the bold vision of a poet to take readers on a perilous journey along the fault line between Islam and Christianity. No one else could have written this book.\"\u00f9Reza Aslan, author of No god but GodThe Tenth Parallel\u00f9the line of latitude seven hundred miles north of the equator\u00f9is a geographical and ideological front line where Christianity and Islam collide. More than half of the world's 13 billion Muslims live along the tenth parallel; so do 60 percent of the world's 2 billion Christians. Here, in the buzzing mega-cities and swarming jungles of Africa and Asia, the two religions meet; their encounter is shaping the future of each faith, and of whole societies as well.An award-winning investigative journalist and poet, Eliza Griswold has spent the past seven years traveling between the equator and the tenth parallel: in Nigeria, the Sudan, and Somalia, and in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The stories she tells in The Tenth Parallel show us that religious conflicts are also conflicts about land, water, oil, and other natural resources, and that local and tribal issues are often shaped by religious ideas. Above all, she makes clear that, for the people she writes about, one's sense of God is shaped by one's place on earth; along the tenth parallel, faith is geographic and demographic.An urgent examination of the relationship between faith and worldly power, The Tenth Parallel is an essential work about the conflicts over religion, nationhood, and natural resources that will remake the world in the years to come.",

        "Authors": "By Bartlett, John and Kaplan, Justin (EDT)",
        "Description": "In 1855 a well-known bookseller from Cambridge, Massachusetts, named John Bartlett self-published A Collection of Familiar Quotations, a book of prose and verse quotes, which he described as \"an attempt to trace to their source passages and phrases in common use.\" That small volume of lasting wisdom has been continuously expanded and published since then and has become the comprehensive, authoritative, and popular bible of quotations fondly known as Bartlett's. Long an indispensable wellspring of inspiration for writers, toastmasters, students, executives, speechwriters, and copywriters, Bartlett's is the best choice for those who want to find the perfect quote to polish a presentation, enrich a narrative, add zest to a celebratory toast, pepper a conversation, or answer the question \"Who said that?\"Bartlett's carries on its early tradition of drawing on classic references. However, since it mirrors our ever changing culture, it also uses many nontraditional sources for quotations, including movies, television, advertising slogans, cartoons, street slang, politics, and music. From the Bible to Bill Clinton, from Sappho to Sitting Bull, from Shakespeare to Seinfeld, from the Upanishads to Updike, Bartlett's spans almost 3,000 years of art, politics, science, religion, and entertainment and gives us a vast written panorama of our world.",

Designed to give readers hope and meaning, he divides the discussion into three parts:Why does a loving God allow us to experience difficulties?How is God active in the middle of our hard times?How can I find God?With powerful stories and practical applications, Where Is God? assures readers that even when it feels as though God is absent it is his nature to be in relationship, to connect with, love, and guide us.

        "Description": "\"George Weigel completes the definitive biography of Pope John Paul II with this indispensable second volume. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the man and the Church he led for a quarter century.\"---John L. Allen Jr., Author of the Future Church\"This book is the Rosetta stone of John Paul II's life and legacy. Only George Weigel's masterful combination of rare opportunities with rarer intuitive and analytic skills could do justice to John Paul II's epic life, which changed the world. More than a sequel to Witness to Hope, this is the climax---an interpretive key like no other.\"---Carl A. Anderson, Supreme Knight and Chief Executive officer of the Knights of Columbus\"Weigel has written what can only be described as an unforgettable book---a portrait of Karol Wojtyla, his Church, and his times that vividly captures one of the central characters of the last one hundred years. Compellingly written, rich in drama, and exhaustive in its research, this is the definitive work on the life and legacy of the Polish Pope and a crowning sequel to Weigel's Witness to Hope.\"---Most Reverend Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., Archbishop of Denver\"As a young man, Karol Wojtyla studied drama, but the greatest human drama of the second half of the twentieth century is the story of his life, his calling, his pontificate. George Weigel draws upon his immense personal knowledge and his finely tuned sense of history to describe the last act of John Paul's life and offers a balanced and appreciative review of the play. This is a book for everyone who wants to be informed about the life of the Catholic Church in recent times, but those who knew and loved the late Pope are especially in Weigel's debt.\"---Francis Cardinal George, O.M.I., Archbishop of Chicago\"In this sequel to Witness to Hope, George Weigel has put the final touches on his definitive portrait of John Paul the Great. With the aid of newly available material, he has filled out his account of Wojtyla's role in the demise of European communism with the story of the relentless campaign that Soviet-era operatives were waging against their feared Polish antagonist in those years. With his insights into Vatican diplomacy, his portrayal of the aging pontiff's struggles with challenges to the Church in the postmodern world, and his judicious assessment of his subject's spiritual and intellectual legacy, Weigel has given us yet another masterpiece of biography.\"---Mary Ann Glendon, Professor of Law at Harvard University and Former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy see\"The author of the landmark Witness to Hope has now finished the story he began so brilliantly. In his new book, George Weigel---biographer and theologian---details John Paul II's battle against totali-tarianism and chronicles the Holy Father's humble acceptance of suffering at the end of earthly life. As ever, Weigel writes with confidence, clarity, and insight.\"---Jon Meacham, New York Times Bestselling Author of American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House\"As March gave way to April in the spring of 2005 and the world kept vigil outside the apostolic palace in Rome, the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, then drawing to a poignant end, was already being described as one of the most consequential in two millennia of Christian history.\"With these words, world-renowned author and NBC Vatican analyst George Weigel begins his long-awaited sequel to the international bestseller Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II. More than ten years in the making, The End and the Beginning: Pope John Paul II---The Victory of Freedom, the Last Years, the Legacy tells the dramatic story of the Pope's battle with communism in light of recently disclosed and previously classified documents and brings to a conclusion Weigel's landmark portrait of a man who left an indelible mark on the Catholic Church and changed the course of world history.When he was elected pope in the fall of 1978, few people had ever heard of the charismatic Karol Wojtyla. But in a very short time he would ignite a revolution of conscience in his native Poland that would ultimately lead to the collapse of European communism and the death of the Soviet Union. What even fewer people knew was that the KGB, the Polish secret police, and the East German Stasi had been waging a dangerous, decades-long war against Wojtyla and the Vatican itself. Weigel, using once-top-secret Soviet-era files, chronicles John Paul's struggle against the dark forces of communism.Weigel then recounts the tumultuous last years of John Paul's life as he dealt with a crippling illness, the new world disorder, and revelations about corruption within the Catholic Church. This thought-provoking and authoritative biography of John Paul II concludes with a probing and comprehensive assessment of a man who lived his life as a witness to hope in service to the Christian ideals he embraced.",

        "Description": "The bestselling book that asks what dogs know and how they think. The answers will surprise and delight you as Alexandra Horowitz, a cognitive scientist, explains how dogs perceive their daily worlds, each other, and that other quirky animal, the human.Horowitz introduces the reader to dogs\u2019 perceptual and cognitive abilities and then draws a picture of what it might be like to be a dog. What\u2019s it like to be able to smell not just every bit of open food in the house but also to smell sadness in humans, or even the passage of time? How does a tiny dog manage to play successfully with a Great Dane? What is it like to hear the bodily vibrations of insects or the hum of a fluorescent light? Why must a person on a bicycle be chased? What\u2019s it like to use your mouth as a hand? In short, what is it like for a dog to experience life from two feet off the ground, amidst the smells of the sidewalk, gazing at our ankles or knees? Inside of a Dog explains these things and much more. The answers can be surprising\u2014once we set aside our natural inclination to anthropomorphize dogs. Inside of a Dog also contains up-to-the-minute research\u2014on dogs\u2019 detection of disease, the secrets of their tails, and their skill at reading our attention\u2014that Horowitz puts into useful context. Although not a formal training guide, Inside of a Dog has practical application for dog lovers interested in understanding why their dogs do what they do. With a light touch and the weight of science behind her, Alexandra Horowitz examines the animal we think we know best but may actually understand the least. This book is as close as you can get to knowing about dogs without being a dog yourself.",

One after\u00adnoon, they decided to walk home along a forbidden road. Djuna disappeared, and for twenty years Celia blocked out how it happened.  The lie Celia told to conceal her misdeed became the accepted truth: everyone assumed Djuna had been abducted, though neither she nor her abductor was ever found.

        "Authors": "By Hartmann, Thom, Miller, Mark Crispin (FRW), and Palast, Greg (AFT)",
        "Description": "Our founding fathers worked hard to ensure that a small group of wealthy people would never dominate this country\u2014they\u2019d had enough of aristocracy. They put government to work to ensure a thriving middle class. When the middle class took a hit, beginning in the post-Civil War Gilded Age and culminating in the Great Depression, democracy-loving leaders like Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower revitalized it through initiatives like antitrust regulations, fair labor laws, the minimum wage, Social Security, and Medicare.  So what happened? Air America Radio host Thom Hartmann shows that over the last twenty-five years, we\u2019ve witnessed an undeclared war against the middle class. The so-called conservatives waging this war are only interested in conserving\u2014and steadily increasing\u2014their own wealth and power. Hartmann shows how, under the guise of \u201cfreeing\u201d the market, they\u2019ve systematically dismantled the programs set up by both Republicans and Democrats to protect the middle class and have replaced them with policies that favor the only the privileged few. But the middle class is the very thing that makes America great. Thomas Jefferson himself believed that our very democracy depends upon our ability to play referee to the game of business, protecting labor and the public good. It is both our right and our responsibility, Jefferson wrote, to control \u201covergrown wealth\u201d from becoming \u201cdangerous to the state.\u201d  We must not stand by while our democracy becomes a corporatocracy, serving an elite group of billionaire CEOs. There is another way. Thomas Jefferson knew how to build a middle class. Franklin Roosevelt knew how. We\u2019ve done it before and we can do it, again. Following Hartmann\u2019s commonsense proposals, we can recreate a prospering middle class that will ensure that our public institutions are not turned into private fiefdoms, meet people\u2019s basic needs\u2014for education, health care, a living wage\u2014and keep America strong,",

        "Authors": "By Cooper, Helene",
        "Description": "Journalist Helene Cooper examines the violent past of her home country Liberia and the effects of its 1980 military coup in this deeply personal memoir and finalist for the 2008 National Book Critics Circle Award.Helene Cooper is \u201cCongo,\u201d a descendant of two Liberian dynasties\u2014traced back to the first ship of freemen that set sail from New York in 1820 to found Monrovia. Helene grew up at Sugar Beach, a twenty-two-room mansion by the sea. Her childhood was filled with servants, flashy cars, a villa in Spain, and a farmhouse up-country. It was also an African childhood, filled with knock foot games and hot pepper soup, heartmen and neegee. When Helene was eight, the Coopers took in a foster child\u2014a common custom among the Liberian elite. Eunice, a Bassa girl, suddenly became known as \u201cMrs. Cooper\u2019s daughter.\u201d For years the Cooper daughters\u2014Helene, her sister Marlene, and Eunice\u2014blissfully enjoyed the trappings of wealth and advantage. But Liberia was like an unwatched pot of water left boiling on the stove. And on April 12, 1980, a group of soldiers staged a coup d'\u00e9tat, assassinating President William Tolbert and executing his cabinet. The Coopers and the entire Congo class were now the hunted, being imprisoned, shot, tortured, and raped. After a brutal daylight attack by a ragtag crew of soldiers, Helene, Marlene, and their mother fled Sugar Beach, and then Liberia, for America. They left Eunice behind.A world away, Helene tried to assimilate as an American teenager. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill she found her passion in journalism, eventually becoming a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. She reported from every part of the globe\u2014except Africa\u2014as Liberia descended into war-torn, third-world hell.In 2003, a near-death experience in Iraq convinced Helene that Liberia\u2014and Eunice\u2014could wait no longer. At once a deeply personal memoir and an examination of a violent and stratified country, The House at Sugar Beach tells of tragedy, forgiveness, and transcendence with unflinching honesty and a survivor's gentle humor. And at its heart, it is a story of Helene Cooper\u2019s long voyage home.",

The principles of individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and constitutionally limited government are what define the Tea Party ethos. They bind us as a movement. And that makes the Tea Party better than a conventional political party---it is a rekindling of the spirit of the revolutionary era, a potent force that will sustain itself long after the first Tuesday in November.---From Give Us Liberty\"Dick Armey's FreedomWorks organization has become front and center in the Tea Party movement.\"---New York TimesFormer House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Matt Kibbe have been on the front lines of one of the fastest-growing and most influential political phenomena in recent memory: the Tea Party movement. As the leaders of the advocacy organization FreedomWorks, they have helped guide and give voice to hundreds of thousands of activists from across the country and have a strong vision for the future of this powerful grassroots uprising.United by a strong belief in limited government and individual liberty, Tea Party members are changing the American political landscape. Unlike mainstream media accounts that observe the Tea Party movement from the outside looking in, Give Us Liberty chronicles the roots and rise of a new breed of taxpayer activism in the voices of those who were there. Discover the personalities that drove the first meetings, the unknown candidates whose principled stand earned them unlikely victories, the march that gathered more than a million activists, and the bedrock beliefs that brought them together.In this national call to action, Armey and Kibbe provide an intimate history of the movement, explain how citizens can join the cause, and chart the future of the Tea Party---and America. Give Us Liberty also contains a battle-tested, step-by-step guide to organizing and effecting change in any community.",

        "Description": "The powerful unvarnished memoir of General Hugh Shelton, war hero, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during 9/11, and one of the leading military figures of our timeWhether serving under a Democratic president or a Republican president, General Shelton was never afraid to speak out and tell it like it is. Shelton chronicles his incredible journey from a small farming community in North Carolina to the highest level of American military and political power at the Pentagon and White House.As one of the nation\u2019s elite Special Forces soldiers, Shelton served twice in Vietnam, commanding a Green Beret unit and then an airborne infantry company. He was awarded a Bronze Star for valor and a Purple Heart for a wound suffered when a booby trap drove a poisoned stake through his leg. Shelton rose up the ranks and was assistant division commander of the 101st Airborne Division as they invaded Iraq in the Persian Gulf War, then led the 20,000 American troops tasked with restoring Haiti\u2019s deposed President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power. Promoted to 4-star General, he became Commander in Chief of U.S. Special Operations Command (including Delta Force, Navy SEALS and other top secret Special Mission Units).But it was while serving as Chairman during both the Clinton and Bush administrations that he faced his biggest challenges, including his role as chief architect of the U.S. military response to 9/11. General Shelton speaks frankly of how decisions were made behind the scenes in the inner sanctum of the E-Ring and Oval Office, and reveals key military operations and meetings that have not yet been revealed, including:* High-ranking Cabinet member proposes intentionally allowing an American pilot to be killed by the Iraqis to have an excuse to retaliate and go to war.* Details of a contentious Camp David meeting among President George W. Bush and his National Security Council immediately after 9/11, where internal battle lines were drawn---and Shelton (along with Colin Powell) convinced President Bush to do the right thing. * How Rumsfeld persuaded General Tommy Franks to bypass the Joint Chiefs, leading to a badly flawed Iraq war plan that failed to anticipate the devastating after-effects of the insurgency and civil war.* Attempts to kill Usama bin Laden that were shot down by our State Department.* CIA botched high-profile terrorist snatches, leaving Shelton\u2019s Special Operations teams to clean up their mess.* How Shelton \u201cpersuaded\u201d Haiti\u2019s dictator to flee the country.* And much more.Yet it's Shelton\u2019s amazing personal story that puts his military career in perspective. It began with a fall from a ladder in his backyard, resulting in total paralysis from the neck down---and a risky experimental procedure, so dangerous that if it didn\u2019t cure him, chances are it would kill him. Revealing, compelling, and controversial, this is the story of a man whose integrity and ethics were always above reproach, and who dedicated his life to serving his country.",

In the Graveyard of Empires is a political history of Afghanistan in the \u201cAge of Terror\u201d from 2001 to 2009, exploring the fundamental tragedy of America\u2019s longest war since Vietnam.After a brief survey of the great empires in Afghanistan\u2014the campaigns of Alexander the Great, the British in the era of Kipling, and the late Soviet Union\u2014Seth G. Jones examines the central question of our own war: how did an insurgency develop? Following the September 11 attacks, the United States successfully overthrew the Taliban regime. It established security throughout the country\u2014killing, capturing, or scattering most of al Qa\u2019ida\u2019s senior operatives\u2014and Afghanistan finally began to emerge from more than two decades of struggle and conflict. But Jones argues that as early as 2001 planning for the Iraq War siphoned off resources and talented personnel, undermining the gains that had been made. After eight years, he says, the United States has managed to push al Qa\u2019ida\u2019s headquarters about one hundred miles across the border into Pakistan, the distance from New York to Philadelphia.While observing the tense and often adversarial relationship between NATO allies in the Coalition, Jones\u2014who has distinguished himself at RAND and was recently named by Esquire as one of the \u201cBest and Brightest\u201d young policy experts\u2014introduces us to key figures on both sides of the war. Harnessing important new research and integrating thousands of declassified government documents, Jones then analyzes the insurgency from a historical and structural point of view, showing how a rising drug trade, poor security forces, and pervasive corruption undermined the Karzai government, while Americans abandoned a successful strategy, failed to provide the necessary support, and allowed a growing sanctuary for insurgents in Pakistan to catalyze the Taliban resurgence.Examining what has worked thus far\u2014and what has not\u2014this serious and important book underscores the challenges we face in stabilizing the country and explains where we went wrong and what we must do if the United States is to avoid the disastrous fate that has befallen many of the great world powers to enter the region.",

In Finding God at Harvard, she presents the compelling testimonies of forty-two faculty members, former students, and distinguished orators at Harvard. Their candid reflections explode the myth that Christian faith cannot survive a rigorous intellectual atmosphere. Finding God at Harvard speaks to the emptiness that haunts college campuses across the country -- an emptiness that only Truth can fill.
