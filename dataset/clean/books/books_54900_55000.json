        "Description": "There\u2019s a reason The Nation, America\u2019s leading progressive magazine, named Robert Wexler the country\u2019s \u201cMost Valuable Congressman.\u201d It's the same reason right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh refers to him as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d It's because for the last twelve years Wexler has been Congress\u2019s most outspoken liberal -- taking on George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Alberto Gonzales, General David Petraeus, and, when necessary, even his own party.In Fire-Breathing Liberal, Wexler brings readers onto the floor of the House and puts them at the center of some of the last decade\u2019s biggest controversies. He passionately describes how he defended Bill Clinton from impeachment and how he stood up against the Bush brothers when the \u201cbutterfly\u201d ballots in his Florida district wrongly decided the 2000 presidential election. He also offers an honest and brutal assessment of the Iraq war and explains why he has become a leader in the movement to impeach Vice President Cheney. And, with warmth and wit, Wexler shares some of the funniest stories from the corridors of Congress, including how he became The Colbert Report\u2019s most talked-about guest.This is a remarkably candid first-person account of recent political history that shows government as it has rarely been seen -- by a Democrat in the middle of the storms.",

        "Title": "Ernie Pyle's War; America's Eyewitness to World War II",
        "Authors": "By Tobin, James",
        "Description": "When a machine-gun bullet ended the life of war correspondent Ernie Pyle in the final days of World War II, Americans mourned him in the same breath as they mourned Franklin Roosevelt. To millions, the loss of this American folk hero seemed nearly as great as the loss of the wartime president.  If the hidden horrors and valor of combat persist at all in the public mind, it is because of those writers who watched it and recorded it in the faith that war is too important to be confined to the private memories of the warriors. Above all these writers, Ernie Pyle towered as a giant. Through his words and his compassion, Americans everywhere gleaned their understanding of what they came to call \"The Good War.\"  Pyle walked a troubled path to fame. Though insecure and anxious, he created a carefree and kindly public image in his popular prewar column -- all the while struggling with inner demons and a tortured marriage. War, in fact, offered Pyle an escape hatch from his own personal hell.  It also offered him a subject precisely suited to his talent -- a shrewd understanding of human nature, an unmatched eye for detail, a profound capacity to identify with the suffering soldiers whom he adopted as his own, and a plain yet poetic style reminiscent of Mark Twain and Will Rogers. These he brought to bear on the Battle of Britain and all the great American campaigns of the war -- North Africa, Sicily, Italy, D-Day and Normandy, the liberation of Paris, and finally Okinawa, where he felt compelled to go because of his enormous public stature despite premonitions of death.  In this immensely engrossing biography, affectionate yet critical, journalist and historian James Tobin does an Ernie Pyle job on Ernie Pyle, evoking perfectly the life and labors of this strange, frail, bald little man whose love/hate relationship to war mirrors our own. Based on dozens of interviews and copious research in little-known archives, Ernie Pyle's War is a self-effacing tour de force. To read it is to know Ernie Pyle, and most of all, to know his war.",

As Deputy to the deputy assistant secretary for Near East Affairs, Florence invents a far-reaching, wide-ranging plan for female emancipation in that part of the world.The U.S. government, of course, tells her to forget it. Publicly, that is. Privately, she\u2019s enlisted in a top-secret mission to impose equal rights for the sexes on the small emirate of Matar (pronounced \u201cMutter\u201d), the \u201cSwitzerland of the Persian Gulf.\u201d Her crack team: a CIA killer, a snappy PR man, and a brilliant but frustrated gay bureaucrat. Her weapon: TV shows.The lineup on TV Matar includes A Thousand and One Mornings, a daytime talk show that features self-defense tips to be used against boyfriends during Ramadan; an addictive soap opera featuring strangely familiar members of the Matar royal family; and a sitcom about an inept but ruthless squad of religious police, pitched as \u201cFriends from Hell.\u201dThe result: the first deadly car bombs in the country since 1936, a fatwa against the station\u2019s entire staff, a struggle for control of the kingdom, and, of course, interference from the French. And that\u2019s only the beginning.A merciless dismantling of both American ineptitude and Arabic intolerance, Florence of Arabia is Christopher Buckley\u2019s funniest and most serious novel yet, a biting satire of how U.S. good intentions can cause the Shiite to hit the fan.",

        "Description": "\u201cAbsolutely brilliant! Fast paced and filled with tension and suspense. Every page resonates with the momentous events and great personalities of World War II \u2013 and scenes so carefully crafted you feel like you\u2019re there. This is a \u2018must read\u2019 for all who look at history and wonder: \u201cWhat if\u2026\u201d -- Oliver North, Lt. Col., USMC (Ret.), host of War Stories on the Fox News ChannelIn 2007, bestselling authors Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen launched a new epic adventure series about World War II in the Pacific, with their book Pearl Harbor: A Novel of December 8th, 1941, which instantly rocketed to the New York Times bestseller list.Gingrich and Forstchen\u2019s now critically acclaimed approach, which they term \u201cactive history,\u201d examines how a change in but one decision might have profoundly altered American history. In Pearl Harbor they explored how history might have been changed if Admiral Yamamoto had directly led the attack on that fateful day, instead of remaining in Japan. Building on that promise, Days of Infamy starts minutes after the close of Pearl Harbor, as both sides react to the monumental events triggered by the presence of Admiral Yamamoto. In direct command of the six carriers of the attacking fleet, Yamamoto decides to launch a fateful \u201cthird-wave attack\u201d on the island of Oahu, and then keeps his fleet in the area to hunt down the surviving American aircraft carriers, which by luck and fate were not anchored in the harbor on that day.Historians have often speculated about what might have transpired from legendary \u201cmatchups\u201d of great generals and admirals. In this story of the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, the notorious gambler Yamamoto is pitted against the equally legendary American admiral Bill Halsey in a battle of wits, nerve, and skill.Days of Infamy recounts this alternative history from a multitude of viewpoints---from President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and the two great admirals, on down to American pilots flying antiquated aircraft, bravely facing the vastly superior Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft. Gingrich and Forstchen have written a sequel that\u2019s as much a homage to the survivors of the real Pearl Harbor attack as it is an imaginative and thrilling take on America\u2019s entry into World War II. Praise for the first book in the Pacific War Series, Pearl Harbor:\"A thrilling tale of American's darkest day.\" --W.E.B. Griffin\"Masterful storytelling that not only captures the heroic highs and hellish lows of that horrific day which lives on in infamy--it resonates with today's conflicts and challeneges.\" --William E. Butterworth IV, New York Times bestselling author of The Saboteurs\"A politician and a novelist, each an accomplished historian in his own right, are emerging as  master authors of alternative history.  In this \u201cwhat if\u201d treatment of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen combine their talents to make the diplomacy as suspenseful as the combat, even for readers who know what happens next\u2013or think they know.\" --Dennis Showalter, former president of the Society of Military Historians\"This book is not only a great read, it is a fascinating historical story that applies today in Iraq as it did in the Western Pacific in the late 30s and 40s.\" --Captain Alex Fraser, USN (Ret.)",

        "Authors": "By Huler, Scott",
        "Description": "When NPR contributor Scott Huler made one more attempt to get through James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, he had no idea it would launch an obsession with the book\u2019s inspiration: the ancient Greek epic The Odyssey and the lonely homebound journey of its Everyman hero, Odysseus.No-Man\u2019s Lands is Huler\u2019s funny and touching exploration of the life lessons embedded within The Odyssey, a legendary tale of wandering and longing that could be read as a veritable guidebook for middle-aged men everywhere. At age forty-four, with his first child on the way, Huler felt an instant bond with Odysseus, who fought for some twenty years against formidable difficulties to return home to his beloved wife and son. In reading The Odyssey, Huler saw the chance to experience a great vicarious adventure as well as the opportunity to assess the man he had become and embrace the imminent arrival of both middle age and parenthood.But Huler realized that it wasn\u2019t enough to simply read the words on the page\u2014he needed to live Odysseus\u2019s odyssey, to visit the exotic destinations that make Homer\u2019s story so timeless. And so an ambitious pilgrimage was born . . . traveling the entire length of Odysseus\u2019s two-decade journey. In six months.Huler doggedly retraced Odysseus\u2019s every step, from the ancient ruins of Troy to his ultimate destination in Ithaca. On the way, he discovers the Cyclops\u2019s Sicilian cave, visits the land of the dead in Italy, ponders the lotus from a Tunisian resort, and paddles a rented kayak between Scylla and Charybdis and lives to tell the tale. He writes of how and why the lessons of The Odyssey\u2014the perils of ambition, the emptiness of glory, the value of love and family\u2014continue to resonate so deeply with readers thousands of years later. And as he finally closes in on Odysseus\u2019s final destination, he learns to fully appreciate what Homer has been saying all along: the greatest adventures of all are the ones that bring us home to those we love. Part travelogue, part memoir, and part critical reading of the greatest adventure epic ever written, No-Man\u2019s Lands is an extraordinary description of two journeys\u2014one ancient, one contemporary\u2014and reveals what The Odyssey can teach us about being better bosses, better teachers, better parents, and better people.",

Now, with The Born Queen, Keyes brings his epic to a masterly close, gathering the strands of plot and character into a stunning climax that both completes and transcends all that has gone before.The Briar King is dead, and the world itself follows him to ruin. Aspar White, wounded and tired, must embark on one last quest to save the forest and the people he loves, but he has little hope of success.Anne Dare at last sits on the throne of Crotheny, but for how long? The Church, now led by the corrupt and powerful March\u00e9 Hespero, has declared a holy war against her, giving the king of Hansa the pretext he needs to unleash his vast might on the young queen and her unready army.But Hansa is the least of Anne\u2019s worries. The Hellrune, war seer of Hansa, strikes at her through vision and prophecy. The Kept\u2013last of the elder Skasloi lords\u2013weaves his own dark webs. Anne\u2019s teacher and ally in the sedos world might also be her worst enemy, and Anne\u2019s own mounting strength compels her toward madness.Surviving these dangers and mastering her eldritch abilities are merely prelude to the real struggle. There are many\u2013some with power matching or even exceeding Anne\u2019s own\u2013who are willing to kill in order to seize control. For whoever sits upon the throne will have the ultimate command to bring about the world\u2019s salvation\u2013or its apocalypse.",

        "Description": "Comic, skeptic, cyber-sleuth, syndicated columnist, and inspired wordsmith, Evan Morris is the Word Detective. He's an etymologist with a sense of humor, a lexicographer with an attitude. Morris's unique approach to language and his distinctive brand of absurdity have found a loyal following of readers curious about everything from soup to nuts--and that means the origins of the phrase soup to nuts, and thousands more words and phrases. This book is a collection of 150 of Morris's language columns, which appear in newspapers throughout the country and on his popular Web site.  A clueless husband writes the WORD DETECTIVE to ask if his wife has insulted him by calling him gormless. Coworkers write to settle a watercooler dispute about the logic of feed a cold, starve a fever. The Word Detective snoops around, follows the leads, and uncovers the answers. The book is chock-full of fascinating lore about the origins and uses of the English language and includes special sections exploring groups of words such as euphemisms, eponyms, and onomatopoeic forms. Funny and offbeat, clever and curmudgeonly, irreverent and irritable, this detective is for all of us who appreciate a dash of wit with our words.",

The fateful moment for the newlyweds Ross and Iliana comes with the freak automobile accident that leaves Iliana paralyzed, Ross grief-stricken, and both of them struggling to come to terms with a married life nothing like they originally had in mind. As the usually affable Ross struggles with guilt and with finding ways to cope with his newly fractured life, Iliana gets used to her unwelcome existence as a wheelchair-bound wife, to her husband\u2019s growing sense of alienation, and to their awkward new lack of intimacy. What ultimately happens with Ross and Iliana is as unexpected and surprising as the fateful mishap that sets the events in motion in the first place. Sitting Practice is a clever and insightful study of love\u2019s collision with harsh reality, told by an author with a remarkable instinct for the workings of human nature, a nimble gift for language, and the ability to find humor in the oddest places.",

        "Title": "The Irish American Family Album (American Family Albums)",
        "Authors": "By Hoobler, Dorothy and Hoobler, Thomas",
        "Description": "Erin go bragh. Ireland forever. The popular Celtic saying is heard in the United States from New York to San Francisco because there are more than 39 million Americans who list their ancestry as Irish. Nearly 800,000 Irish arrived here between 1841 and 1850, and 900,000 followed over the next decade. In other words, more than one out of every five people in Ireland left for the United States in that 20-year period. The Irish American Family Album is a remarkable history and memoir. In their own words--from diary entries, letters, interviews, and personal reflections--and with photographs and clippings pulled from family archives and the press of the day, the rich and colorful history of the Irish immigration to this country is told with a passion and wit that is uniquely Irish. Life on the \"ould sod\" and the hardships of the great potato famine and British rule, the decision to leave, the arduous Atlantic journey, first impressions of their new home, settling in and building a new life--all are made immediate and real through the words and snapshots of the participants. But not all are happy memories. Most of the immigrants were young people and left Ireland with a heavy heart, believing that they would never again see those they left behind. They faced prejudice in this country--\"No Irish Need Apply\" was a familiar sign in shop windows and in newspaper advertisements--and living conditions in the tenements they could afford were a far cry from life on the farm back home. Many immigrants found their first jobs here as laborers. They were among the workers who built the Erie Canal, the transcontinental railroad, and the Statue of Liberty.  In the west, Irish laborers found work as miners during the gold rush. Irish women often worked as servants in the houses of the upper class, or worked in the cloth mills of New England.  Though prejudice tried to keep the majority at the bottom of society, the very size of the Irish American community made them a powerful political force, and in cities such as Boston, New York, and Chicago, the Irish took control of local political organizations and were soon a force to be reckoned with. There are many success stories in The Irish American Family Album. The Kennedy family, film actor John Wayne, artist Georgia O'Keeffe, novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman justice of the Supreme Court--all bear witness to the strength and endurance of the Irish spirit. These and other famous Irish Americans are profiled throughout the book. But the real joy comes in seeing the multitude of faces in the rare and fascinating photographs, and reading memories of Irish grandmothers, of boys who grew up in \"Hell's Kitchen\" at the turn of the century, of an early union organizer, and the thousand of other voices that make up the proud and diverse Irish American community. Their stories add an important chapter to the multicultural portrait of America.",

As she slowly awakens to the needs of her body, heart, and spirit, she discards the conventions of classroom teaching and learns what her students&#39; lives are like. A painful and exhilarating story of spiritual awakening, Tompkins&#39; book critiques our educational system while also paying tribute to it.",

Outrageous and wise, Sin Boldly! goes where no other how-to-write handbook has dared go before. Personal, perceptive, and purposefully provocative, this book offers students crucial advice on the entire writing process. From choosing a paper topic to adopting a persuasive voice, shaping an argument, and organizing an essay; from political correctness (or lack thereof) to matters of style, punctuation, and usage, Sin Boldly! is crammed with information, ideas, and examples that will entertain and instruct even the most confident students in their quest for the A+ they all think they deserve.",

She revisits the people and places that have shaped her experiences and inspired her work. And she pays tribute to the one loving constant that has offered her comfort and meaning even as the faces and events in her life have changed: her beloved cats.With searing honesty Piercy tells of her strained childhood growing up in a religiously split working-class family in Detroit. She examines her myriad friendships and relationships, including two painful early marriages, and reveals their effects on her creativity and career. More than a reminiscence of things past, however, Sleeping with Cats is also a celebration of the present and the future, as Piercy shares her views on aging, creativity, and finding a lasting and improbable love with a man fourteen years younger than herself. A chronicle of the turbulent and exciting journey of one artist's life, Sleeping with Cats is a deeply intimate, unforgettable story.",

In his best work, the subversive insights embedded in his wit continue to challenge our common assumptions. Wilde's ability to unsettle and startle us anew with his radical vision of the artifice inherent in the self's construction makes him our contemporary.This edition is introduced by John Lahr, author of Prick Up Your Ears: The Biography of Joe Orton.
