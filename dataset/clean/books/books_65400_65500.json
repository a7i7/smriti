She finds her self-confidence rising, and plummeting, depending on each new situation. Classes are definitely more interesting, but algebra is proving to be nearly impossible. Patrick is in the accelerated program so they aren't in the same classes anymore. And while she's thrilled to be chosen to work on the school newspaper, she finds that between an increased homework load and reporting assignments, she can't always join Patrick when he wants to go out. But the new girl in town, Penny, can...and does. Penny is everything Alice isn't -- perky, petite, and cute as a button, and she doesn't hide her interest in Patrick. Alice senses her seemingly perfect relationship with Patrick starting to crumble, along with her self-confidence, and suddenly, Alice feels big and awkward and not particularly attractive. Could it be possible that Patrick could like someone else besides her? She can't imagine life without Patrick in it.But Patrick's behavior isn't the only thing that is baffling Alice. Elizabeth's nearly hysterical reluctance to go to her piano lessons has Alice and Pamela completely bewildered, until Elizabeth breaks down and shares an awful secret she's kept from everybody since she was seven...And as Alice struggles to keep her jealousy of Penny at bay, she watches her father handle unsettling news regarding his fianc\u00e9. Alice learns what trust is all about, and how confidence in yourself, and in others, is the most important thing of all.",

        "Description": "I've come to the conclusion that roughly 50 percent of the adults in this country are simply too ignorant and functionally incompetent to be living in a free society. You might think I'm off base, but every day around half the people in this country go out of their way to prove me right.\u2014from Somebody's Gotta Say ItThink you've got it all figured out? Think again.Neal Boortz\u2014the Talkmaster, the High Priest of the Church of the Painful Truth\u2014has been edifying, infuriating, and entertaining talk radio audiences for more than three decades with his blend of straight talk and twisted humor. Now, the author of the smash number one bestseller The FairTax Book returns to gore every sacred cow in the pasture, from the subversive agendas behind children's books to the scam artists behind \"High Art.\" In Somebody's Gotta Say It, Boortz warms up for the coming political season with a preemptive strike in \"the War on the Individual\": \"The Democrats' theme for 2008 will be 'The Common Good.' I can't speak for you, but I am an individual. Government exists to protect my rights, not to order my life. And I damn sure don't exist to serve government.\" He takes on liberal catchphrases like giving back (\"Nobody\u2014especially not the evil, wretched rich\u2014actually earns anything anymore. Why do liberals think this way? Because they find it impossible to acknowledge that people work for money\"), our rampant civic idiocy (\"We are not a democracy. Never were. Weren't supposed to be. And we shouldn't be\"), and Big Brother (\"We have smoke-free workplaces. We have drug-free school zones. I say let's start establishing government-free oases, where we can be free to leave our seat belts unbuckled, and peel the labels off anything we choose\"). And somehow, along the way, he finds room for pop quizzes, cat-chasing contests, and an answer, once and for all, to the eternal question, \"Neal, why don't you run for president?\"\u2014in a chapter called \"No Way in Hell.\"  Full of irresistible wisecracks and irrefutable libertarian wisdom, Somebody's Gotta Say It is one man's response to America at a time when the government overreaches, the people underperform\u2014and the truth hurts.",

        "Description": "Few women have aroused as much adoration or approbation as Alma Mahler, or possessed as potent an allure for men of outstanding talent. In the course of her long, turbulent life, she married the composer Gustav Mahler, the architect Walter Gropius, and the novelist Franz Werfel; conducted a love affair with the painter Oskar Kokoschka; and befriended Alban Berg, Thomas Mann, Gustav Klimt, and Arnold Schonberg. Born in Habsburg Austria in 1879, she saw her native Vienna decline from the peak of its glory, weathered World War I and the Weimar years, survived three children, and made a hairbreadth escape from the Nazis by fleeing to America, where she died at the age of eighty-five in 1964.This outstanding biography - the result of ten years' research - captures both the grandeur and the ambiguity of Alma Mahler's life. It gives us not only the femme fatale, but also the gifted musician who sublimated her own talent, and the anti-Semite who married two Jews and became a refugee from Hitler. The Bride of the Wind explores the nature of Alma Mahler's considerable mystique and her role in the creative ferment of her time. It belongs in the company of the classic biographies of such powerful and charismatic women as Zelda Fitzgerald, Eva Peron, and Sarah Bernhardt.",

Under the third section, on creating a peaceful world, for example, one may find \"The Jain Declaration on Nature,\" wherein it is written that one of Gandhi's most treasured friends was a Jain, Shrimad Rajchandra, who influenced the Mahatma with a central Jain tenet,  ahimsa , or nonviolence. The section on the Unification Church, another example, is absent all mention of the different phases and kinds of Moon's troubles, attempting only to give an objective portrait of the religion's tenets. This uncontentious, unconditionally loving compendium came out of a 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)",

In the dust of a typical house, carpet beetles, mites, silverfish, and other creatures live and die, producing new generations every few months. Mold, bacteria, and yeast lurk undetected in heating and cooling systems. Debris dispersed into the air from these organisms can cause runny noses, itchy eyes, coughing, headaches, and breathing difficulties. Some people, especially those made highly sensitive by allergies, suffer from devastating health problems and the worry that, as one such sufferer lamented, \"My house is killing me!\"Scrutinizing house dust and air samples with a microscope, indoor air quality expert Jeffrey C. May has spent his career helping people identify what's causing their chronic health problems. In My House Is Killing Me! he draws on the dramatic personal stories of his clients' suffering and relief to help readers understand the links between environmental factors and problems like allergies and asthma. Explaining how air conditioning, finished basements, and other home features affect air quality, he offers a step-by-step approach to identifying, controlling, and often eliminating the sources of indoor pollutants and allergens. If we could see this contamination, May observes, the air would look as murky as stagnant water, and we would know not to breathe it.Reading My House Is Killing Me! lets you see your house the way an expert would. Just as he looks at spaces and systems during an indoor air quality investigation, May focuses first on the areas of daily life (bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen), then looks into attics and basements (including heating and air conditioning), and finally moves outside to the garage and the exterior of a home. Along with offering a wealth of practical advice and proven solutions for various problems, he includes a glossary of terms and a list of valuable resources.",

        "Title": "Daniel Isn't Talking: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Leimbach, Marti",
        "Description": "Marti Leimbach\u2019s first novel, Dying Young, was called \u201ca masterpiece of details that always ring true, with the sad, funny and fascinating unpredictability of real life.\u201d With the same talent and perception, Leimbach\u2019s new novel takes the reader to London, to the home of the Marshes: Stephen Marsh, a true Brit; Melanie, a transplanted American; and their two children, four-year-old Emily and Daniel, just three. When it is conveyed that Daniel is autistic, the orderly life of the Marsh family is shattered.Melanie is determined to fight to teach Daniel to speak, play and become as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible. Her enchanting disposition has already helped her weather other of life\u2019s storms, but Daniel\u2019s autism may just push her over the brink, destroying her resolute optimism and bringing her unsteady marriage to an inglorious end. The situation is not helped by Stephen\u2019s far-from-supportive parents, who proudly display the family tree with Melanie\u2019s name barely penciled in, and who remain disconcertingly attached to Stephen\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e, a woman apparently intent on restaking her claim on Stephen. Melanie does have one strong ally in Andy, a talented and off-the-wall play therapist who specializes in teaching autistic children. Andy proves that Daniel is far more capable than anyone imagined, and Melanie finds herself drawn to him even as she staggers toward resolving her marriage.Daniel Isn\u2019t Talking is a moving, deeply absorbing story of a family in crisis. What sets it apart from most fiction about difficult subjects is the author\u2019s ability to write about a sad and frightening situation with a seamless blend of warmth, compassion and humor.",

        "Description": "Abu Simbel, Angkor Wat, Petra: today we stand in awe before the great monuments of the past as we wonder who built them and for what purpose. This authoritative and profusely illustrated compendium celebrates the achievements of those ancient builders who created huge and impressive structures without the benefit of modern technology. Expanding upon the theme of the traditional Seven Wonders, The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World incorporates marvels from around the globe, spanning the centuries from the first stone monuments of the fifth millennium b.c. to the Great Temple of the Aztecs in the sixteenth century a.d. The shaping of the Great Sphinx at Giza, the raising of the stones at Stonehenge, the laying out of the Nazca Lines on the face of the Peruvian desert, or the construction of the Great Wall of China (probably the greatest building project ever attempted in ancient times) are all described and explained in light of the most up-to-date archaeological research. So too are the erection of Egyptian obelisks and Easter Island statues, and the building of Roman roads and Inca bridges. Neglected monuments such as the giant stelae of Aksum or the mountain palace at Sigiriya are set beside the great Baths of Caracalla in Rome and the palace of Persepolis. Packed with factfiles, diagrams, photographs, and newly commissioned perspective views, The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World provides a testament to the skill of the ancient engineers and architects who created lasting memorials--some for practical ends, others for prestige and propaganda--that have continued to impress successive generations through the ages.",

Successful Six Sigma occurs when the technical and cultural components of change balance in an organization; this timely, comprehensive book is devoted to the cultural component of implementing Six Sigma, explaining how to manage it to maintain that balance.

        "Authors": "By Bedbury, Scott and Fenichell, Stephen",
        "Description": "No company can succeed without a great product or service, but in today's competitive market it also needs a brand. Transcending the tangible aspects of a commodity and nurturing a brand to build a deeper and more enduring emotional connection with customers has become one of the most critical and complex challenges facing businesses today, whether they are multinational corporations or small, local enterprises.  How did a company like Nike use \"Just Do It\" to launch its way to success and become part of global culture? How did Starbucks reinvent a familiar 900-year-old product and change the way people drink coffee around the world? In A New Brand World Scott Bedbury, who was at the heart of both companies as they became two of the greatest branding success stories of our time, explains how to apply the principles that grew these companies more than fivefold and established their trademarks as leaders in their categories.  With fascinating anecdotes from his own in-the-trenches experience and dozens of case studies (including companies like Harley-Davidson, Guinness, the Gap, and Disney), Bedbury offers practical, battle-tested advice and an analysis of why some brands succeed where others fail. A New Brand World will show any business-whether a Fortune 500 corporation or a neighborhood store-how it can begin to realize its full brand potential and build lasting value.  Inspiring, visionary, and witty, A New Brand World will become the key book for building brands in the twenty-first-century economy.",

Finally, she is inches away from being promoted to her dream job -- covering courtroom drama for the paper -- but after one spectacularly disastrous day, she is fired instead.Lena \"Lipstick Carcrash\" Lipp encrass has a pretty fabulous life, even by a socialite's standards, as a top editor at the high fashion magazine Y. Long lunches with her girlfriends and afternoons spent shopping at Bergdorf's are all in a day's work. But when Lena's always indulgent parents abruptly cut off her cash flow and kick her out of her beloved West Village duplex for refusing to work for the family business, she is forced to confront the reality of what it takes to pay the bills.Dana Gluck, a workaholic lawyer, had been married for two years to a man who was perfect on paper but increasingly critical in reality. She hoped that her dreams of motherhood would be fulfilled soon, which surely would also fix their marriage problems. Instead, her husband leaves her for an exchange student/model who, to make matters worse, promptly gets pregnant.When fate conspires to have these three very different women move into the same SoHo apartment building, they soon discover that having their carefully planned lives fall to pieces might be the best thing that could have ever happened to them.",

        "Description": "The brilliant new novel from one of our most respected writers--his most ambitious and accessible to date.On a January morning in 1913, G. H. Hardy--eccentric, charismatic and, at thirty-seven, already considered the greatest British mathematician of his age--receives in the mail a mysterious envelope covered with Indian stamps. Inside he finds a rambling letter from a self-professed mathematical genius who claims to be on the brink of solving the most important unsolved mathematical problem of all time. Some of his Cambridge colleagues dismiss the letter as a hoax, but Hardy becomes convinced that the Indian clerk who has written it--Srinivasa Ramanujan--deserves to be taken seriously. Aided by his collaborator, Littlewood, and a young don named Neville who is about to depart for Madras with his wife, Alice, he determines to learn more about the mysterious Ramanujan and, if possible, persuade him to come to Cambridge. It is a decision that will profoundly affect not only his own life, and that of his friends, but the entire history of mathematics.Based on the remarkable true story of the strange and ultimately tragic relationship between an esteemed British mathematician and an unknown--and unschooled--mathematical genius, and populated with such luminaries such as D. H. Lawrence, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, The Indian Clerk takes this extraordinary slice of history and transforms it into an emotional and spell-binding story about the fragility of human connection and our need to find order in the world.",

I am watching one right now.\u201dHe\u2019s watching a snuff film. And the person dying before his disbelieving eyes is Damrong\u2014a woman he once loved obsessively and, now it becomes clear, endlessly. And there is something more: something at the end of the film that leaves Sonchai both figuratively and literally haunted. While his investigation will lead him through the office of the ever-scheming police captain, Vikorn (\u201cDon\u2019t spoil a great case with too much perfectionism,\u201d he advises Sonchai); in and out of the influence of a perhaps psychotic wandering monk; and eventually into the gilded rooms of the most exclusive men\u2019s club in Bangkok (whose members will do anything to protect their identities, and to explore their most secret fantasies), it also leads him to his own simple bedroom where he sleeps next to his pregnant wife while his dreams deliver him up to Damrong . . .Ferociously smart and funny, furiously fast-paced, and laced through with an erotic ghost story that gives a new dark twist to the life of our hero, Bangkok Haunts does exactly that from first page to last.",
