        "Description": "Through the centuries, Our Blessed Lady has appeared frequently on earth with messages of warning, hope, and consolation for humanity--but never more frequently than in the last two centuries. Heralded as the Marian Age, the past two hundred years have been blessed with numerous appearances of Our Lady, each one offering messages of inspiration and hope and urging the world to return to the love of God through prayer, penance, and reparation for sins.A Woman Clothed with the Sun considers the seven most significant apparitions of Our Lady in the past two centuries: that of the Miraculous Medal at Paris, those at La Salette, Lourdes, Knock, Fatima, Beauraing, Banneux--and also the sixteenth-century appearance of Mary at Guadalupe with its profound message for Americans. The historical background of each apparition is given, the vision itself described, and Mary's messages are quoted by writers distinguished for their special knowledge of the apparitions and their literary excellence. In his introductory chapter, editory John J. Delaney traces the relationships between the apparitions and provides a penetrating\u00a0analysis\u00a0of their significance.Recipient of the Marian Library Medal, A Woman Clothed with the Sun has been critically acclaimed as the one book on Our Lady that should be read by everyone.",

        "Description": "\"A Great Gatsby for the end of the century.\" -- The Baltimore SunJay McInerney's first novel, Bright Lights, Big City, helped bring about a revolution in contemporary fiction in trade paperback. But more importantly, its publication brought us a major writer of great literary talent and incisive perception. In his latest novel, Model Behavior, McInerney offers us the portrait of a doubting devotee of the city where vocation, career, and ambition (which only occassionally coincide) run head-on with friendship and love--or merely desire. We see Conor McKnight's well-earned ennui fast becoming anxiety as he tries to protect himself from the harrowing fate that unfolds before his bleary eyes. McInerney is at the peak of his craft in what is sure to become a classic at the end of the century. This edition contains only the novel Model Behavior, and not the additional seven stories which were published in the original hardcover.",

        "Description": "Exclusive interview with Ariel Sharon! A probing look at the war on terrorism. Conflict in the Middle East has simmered and boiled for decades. Now, war and terrorism are global in scope. The Last War contains supremely relevant information for all concerned:  Why do Islamic radicals hate the West? What is the radical Moslem\u2019s world view? Who are Osama bin Laden\u2019s allies? Who are the \u201cLittle Satan\u201d and the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d? Are we being told the whole truth about our enemies?  Tragically, a decade of intense diplomacy and negotiation has given way to widespread violence: some analysts, aware of the real potential for catastrophic war in the region, openly wonder if this will all lead to a \u201clast war\u201d of sorts. After seven years of \"confidence-building\" measures that are the framework of the Oslo Accords - an ambitious attempt to bring Israelis and Palestinians to a final peace agreement - the whole affair is unraveling. Violence in the West Bank has accelerated dramatically since Yitzak Rabin and Yasser Afarat signed the Declaration of Principles on the White House lawn in 1993. In this indepth study of the peace process, the reader will learn little-reported facts about the peace process and the people involved, and will be able to see clearly that the latest confrontations are a prelude to a devastating conclusion.",

Our basic human rights and freedoms were-and are-\"Creator-endowed.\" Gingrich sounds a clarion call for us to recognize that the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness that we hold so dear are inseparable from a sincere and humble acknowledgement that these gifts are only the Creator's to give.

Forensic psychiatrist Jo Beckett's specialty is the psychological autopsy- an investigation into a person's life to determine whether a death was natural, accidental, suicide, or homicide. She calls herself a deadshrinker instead of a head-shrinker: The silence of her \"patients\" is a key part of the job's attraction. When Jo is asked to do a psychological autopsy on a living person-one with a suspect memory who can't be trusted to participate in his own medical care-she knows all her skills will be put to the test. Jo is called to the scene of an aircraft inbound from London to help deal with a passenger who is behaving erratically. She figures out that he's got anterograde amnesia, and can't form new memories. Jo finds herself racing to save a patient who can walk and talk and yet can't help Jo figure out just what happened to him. For every cryptic clue he is able to drag up from his memory, Jo has to sift through a dozen nonsensical statements. Suddenly a string of clues arises, something to do with a superdeadly biological agent code-named \"Slick,\" a missing wife and son, and a secret partnership gone horribly wrong. Jo realizes her patient's addled mind may hold the key to preventing something terrible from happening in her beloved San Francisco. In order to prevent it, she will have to get deeper into the life of a patient than she ever has before, hoping the truth emerges from the fog of his mind in time to save her city-and herself.",

        "Description": "The year is 1502, and Italy is ablaze with the artistic radiance, the sexual corruption, the political intrigue, and the religious fanaticism of the Renaissance. The depraved Rodrigo Borgia, Pope Alexander VI, conducts orgies in the Vatican while Leonardo da Vinci paints masterpieces for noble patrons. Genius has never been more highly prized; passion has never been more dangerous. Against this incandescent backdrop, George Herman unfolds a brilliant debut novel about art, politics, disguise, betrayal, and the creation of the theatrical form known as commedia dell'arte.A vagabond of improbable erudition and outrageous appearance sneaks into Italy from the north and invents a new identity and name for himself - Harlequin. In Aosta, he falls into the company of an aging, resourceful whore named Colombina who promises to feed and transport him if he'll teach her to read and to dance. As this unlikely pair flees south through Italy, they unwittingly gather a motley crew: Scapino, a juggling cut-purse, and his lecherous bastard son Pantalone; Giacomo, Leonardo's inept artistic assistant, who assumes a new identity as the Dottore; Isabella, an aristocratic bluestocking traveling incognito; the blustering Capitano, wanted for desertion; a spirited tart on the run; and a handsome student in search of adventure.Pooling their wits, their talents, and their scanty resources, this band of fugitives, misfits, and thieves don fantastic disguises and, transforming their guild wagon into a stage set, mount bawdy, slapstick entertainments in the city piazzas. The new form of people's theater - commedia dell'arte - sweeps the country with its hilarious mockery of the corrupt nobles and clergy, allowing the actors to slip through the hands of the Borgia spies, who are pursuing them for a variety of mysterious reasons...Mingling real and invented characters, the famous and the infamous, Carnival of Saints vividly captures an era as noted for its cruelties and corruption as for its fine arts - a time when men would kill, and not necessarily just paint, for their patrons. Rich in plot and character, meticulous in its re-creation of the past, Carnival of Saints stands alone for its pungent humor, its inventive flair, and its ribald originality. George Herman's stunning first novel is a wildly entertaining comic masterpiece.",

        "Title": "Neutral Buoyancy: Adventures in a Liquid World",
        "Authors": "By Ecott, Tim",
        "Description": "In Neutral Buoyancy, journalist and diver Tim Ecott takes you on a guided tour of the history of undersea exploration and the emergence of diving culture. He tells the extraordinary story of man's attempts to breathe underwater, from the sponge divers described by Aristotle, to the development of sixteenth-century diving bells, to the invention of modern scuba equipment. Along the way, Ecott intersperses the story with his own thrilling adventures, from the waters of the South Pacific to the remote islands of the Seychelles, from explorations in the clear, flowing tides of Sardinia to a near-death experience in the cold gray depths of the English Channel. Filled with engaging stories of humanity's conquest of the undersea world -- and heart-pounding action that will leave you breathless -- Neutral Buoyancy is a compelling blend of history and adventure, an exciting overview of the world of undersea diving. \"As elemental, entertaining, and stimulating as the environment it traces.\" -- Kirkus Reviews \"Engaging ... Neutral Buoyancy will certainly become cult reading for divers.\" -- Alexander Urquhart, The Times Literary Supplement \"Ecott's encyclopedic recounting of diving history ... should be awarded a place on any diver's reference shelf.\" -- Paul McHugh, San Francisco Chronicle",
