        "Title": "On Kissing: Travels in an Intimate Landscape",
        "Authors": "By Blue, Adrianne",
        "Description": "A kiss can be an expression of parental affection or the focus of an erotic experience, a defensive social maneuver or an admission of vulnerability. In legend, a kiss can turn an ugly witch into a great beauty; in Hollywood, a kiss can transform a great beauty into a legend. Few gestures bring so much pleasure or play such an important role in our lives, as Adrianne Blue demonstrates in this funny, sexy, and eye-opening book.She explores every dimension of kissing, from the purely physical to the artfully abstract. Physiologically, it takes only two muscles to purse the lips, but a passionate kiss can involve all thirty-four facial muscles, and the rest of the body as well. Psychologically, kissing develops an infant's need to suckle, and it picks up a great deal of symbolic emotional baggage throughout our lives. Socially, it all depends on context: in Provence, three kisses are expected as a friendly greeting; in Japan, even a single peck can be a grave affront.One of Edison's first films was devoted to the kiss, and Blue offers her candidates for the silver screen's hottest kisses, reflecting along the way on the changing ideals of the sexy mouth, from Garbo's delicate thin line to Julia Roberts's fulsome fleshiness. She describes the kiss in other visual arts as well, such as the famous sculptures of Rodin and Brancusi, and she gathers a richly varied collection of poems, from those by Catullus (\"the Elvis of ancient Rome\") to the Song of Songs, assembled here for lovers to share as they explore the many dimensions of kissing.",

Particles and Luck is the story of the Halloween night they spend together, trying to imagine how this threat will materialize. Camped out amidst pieces of Roger's Naugahyde furniture, warmed by a pile of Kingsford briquettes, fortified by some frozen peas and meat that has not quite thawed, marking boundary lines with Oakland Raiders pennants - this will be a night unlike any other in contemporary fiction.",

        "Description": "Dr. Ravi Batra, whose book The Great Depression of 1990 was on the New York Times bestseller list for fifty-two weeks, now boldly challenges the myth of free trade. The startling evidence he sets forth shows that the United States is on the edge of economic disaster.Although mainstream economists - and highly paid corporate executives - trumpet \"free trade\" as America's best possible source of prosperity, Dr. Batra insists the policy may have damaged our economy as severely as the Great Depression. Almost every economic problem we face - the outrageous federal deficit; rising unemployment; the shrinking middle class; the \"merger mania\" that slashed jobs, killed competitiveness, and increased corporate debt; and environmental degradation - can be linked to the free trade policy that the United States has been following over the last twenty years.Batra sets forth a compelling plan for \"competitive protectionism\" and prescribes a radical but well-reasoned five-year plan for economic revival:average tariffs on imports should be raised from 5 percent to 40 percentban mergers among giant firmsIBM, General Motors, and other Fortune 500 firms should be split into smaller, more competitive units, along the lines of the AT&T divestiture in 1982; no single company should be allowed more than 10 percent of the domestic marketencourage foreign investment in the United States in new ventures; don't permit investors to simply buy existing concernsthe U.S. government should take an active role in subsidizing private R&D spending with money from increased tariff revenue and from drastically reduced defense spendingIn his stunning conclusion, Batra makes a clear and convincing argument that \"competitive protectionism would increase tax revenues, resurrect the manufacturing base, raise real earnings for 80 percent of the work force, trim inequality, reduce the rate of poverty, enhance the growth of productivity, cripple the abuse of monopoly power by big business, revitalize the economy, and, above all, restore America's economic leadership in the world.\"",

Abandoned as a baby and then again and again, Mi Sook is raised in a Korean coffee shop by its string of owner-mothers. She grows to adulthood fiercely independent and eventually comes to manage the shop. But her marriage to Kun Soo, with whom she has three children, begins a series of events that ultimately wrench her babies from her arms. Deceived by Kun Soo and his well-intentioned mother, and unsupported by a rigidly Confucian culture, Mi Sook emerges as a tragic and heroic figure who embodies the rich complexities of a nation -- and of the heart.",

Until the day, that is, when Pobby and Dingan disappear--the same day that Ashmol and Kellyanne's father is accused of \"ratting\" (poaching on someone else's land), the worst sin an opal miner can commit.As Kellyanne--grief-stricken and suddenly, mysteriously, ill--begins to fade away, Ashmol recruits the whole town in a search for Pobby and Dingan. In the end, however, he discovers that only he can find them, and that he can only find them if he too believes they are real.Funny, deeply moving and told without a wasted word, Pobby and Dingan--the debut of a prodigiously gifted new writer--is an enchanting story.",

But the mock battle could be his last stand when a well-aimed minie ball emerges from the mist to knock Stanley unconscious and kill local businessman Rance Wofford. Which man was the target? No one knows.The idea that someone might want to kill him shakes Stanley to his core. He concedes that the host of Hello, World often stabbed him in the back in front of millions of viewers, but would he actually stoop to murder? Stanley doesn't intend to be a sitting duck for another try. But Higgins police chief Marilyn Tunney, Stanley's high school sweetheart and new flame, warns him to leave the investigating to Brad Bridger - her young, very handsome detective.",

Shockingly, the librarian's demise exactly coincides with the hundredth anniversary of the death of Mr. Hector Rigglesworth, the Chitterton Fells Library ghost, a man with a deep grudge against the romantic novels that kept his seven daughters endlessly holding out for the perfect suitor.",

        "Title": "Sound and Fury: The Washington Punditocracy and the Collapse of American Politics",
        "Authors": "By Alterman, Eric",
        "Description": "Never in our history has the American political system seemed so aimless, so irrelevant, and so downright disgraceful as it does today. Television has become dominant to the point that it now not only serves as the sole viable medium for the debate of issues but has also provided the fodder for political platforms, and even budding presidential candidates. \"Objective\" reporting in the print media is political double-speak, but, even more important, it deprives us of the context that would allow us to make an informed judgment about a given issue. What we are left with, simply, is the punditocracy: the highly visible, extremely well-paid, and seemingly omnipresent pontificators who make their living offering \"inside political opinions and forecasts\" in the elite national media. It is their debate, rather than any semblance of a democratic one, that determines the parameters of political discourse in the nation today.In his shrewd, provocative, and entertaining Sound and Fury, journalist and historian Eric Alterman takes the first comprehensive survey of the world of political pundits - their history, their influence, their style and substance. How have the George Wills, the John McLaughlins, the Robert Novaks, the William Safires, the Pat Buchanans, and all the op-ed and opinion makers whom we have come to regard as authoritative voices on the subject of government actually achieved their authority? How do they deploy their power? Who really listens to them, and what does their ascendancy mean for our political future?Sound and Fury opens with a historical overview of punditry, focusing on the greatest of all pundits, Walter Lippmann, avatar of punditry's Golden Age and as close to a philosopher as the popular media has ever produced. Tracing Lippmann's heirs, Alterman presents a series of portraits of the leading pundits of the Reagan/Bush years, a period when the profession came into its own - no more notably than in the person of the jaunty courtier George Will, and no more potently than around the bullyboy roundtables, the weekly pundit sitcoms, led by the likes of punditry's P. T. Barnum, former Watergate priest John McLaughlin. The book closes with an examination of the punditocracy at work in the Bush era, and how it successfully - and dangerously - defined the shape of the United States' response to Mikhail Gorbachev, the end of the Cold War, and that ne plus ultra of pundit adventurism, Operation Desert Storm.One of the most original and witty treatments of American politics in decades, Sound and Fury is a searching look at the diseased American body politic and its blithely hubristic talking heads.",

His only refuge is the F train and its connection to long Manhattan nights in East Village bars that he visits with his forlorn and eccentric friends.As the summer grows hotter and his apartment more threatening, a baffled but tolerant Ned sets out to uncover the secret behind the angry spirit and, in so doing, is drawn irretrievably into a world of desire and fate ... where all around him lingers the dark dream of New Orleans, a place of magical disaster. Ten years before, he fled the Crescent City, never to return, when Antoinette, his true love, ended their brief but urgent affair. Now he's going back, returning to the past that has haunted him for a decade.",

As James Massey and Shirley Maxwell show in this fact-filled sampler, Gothic Revival caught the fancy of many Victorians who sought refuge in supposedly simpler days. Picturesque castles and cathedrals with spiky towers, high gabled roofs, and medieval ornament provided just the escape needed from the rigors of the industrial revolution.Gothic Revival recreates the age of Victoria by chronicling the era and its architecture, furnishings, fashions, art, literature, designers, and key buildings, all in an inviting format that brings back the style's heyday from the 1830s to the 1870s.",
