In 21st century Los Angeles, geneticist Julia is trying to identify people who can kill without remorse. Stunned to discover that she seems to possess the trait she is looking for, Julia is reassured of her emotions by her intense passion for her husband and her delight in her pregnancy.

        "Authors": "By Karsh, Efraim",
        "Description": "From the first Arab-Islamic Empire of the mid-seventh century to the Ottomans, the last great Muslim empire, the story of the Middle East has been the story of the rise and fall of universal empires and, no less important, of imperialist dreams. So argues Efraim Karsh in this highly provocative book. Rejecting the conventional Western interpretation of Middle Eastern history as an offshoot of global power politics, Karsh contends that the region\u2019s experience is the culmination of long-existing indigenous trends, passions, and patterns of behavior, and that foremost among these is Islam\u2019s millenarian imperial tradition.The author explores the history of Islam\u2019s imperialism and the persistence of the Ottoman imperialist dream that outlasted World War I to haunt Islamic and Middle Eastern politics to the present day. September 11 can be seen as simply the latest expression of this dream, and such attacks have little to do with U.S. international behavior or policy in the Middle East, says Karsh. The House of Islam\u2019s war for world mastery is traditional, indeed venerable, and it is a quest that is far from over.",

Most of the guides are devoted to a single opera, which is described in detail?with many articles that cover its history and information about the composer and his times. The complete libretto is included in both the original language and in a modern singing translation?except where the opera was written in English. Each has a thematic guide to the most important musical themes in musical notation and each guide is lavishly illustrated. They also contain a bibliography and a discography which is updated at each reprint. The ENO guides are widely regarded as the best series of their kind and excellent value.",

        "Description": "Parents want a special relationship with their children Parents care. They want to guide their children through the rough spots in life and help them make the right decisions. Research shows that a special parental connection is extremely important in safeguarding children against dangers such as substance abuse, sexual promiscuity, criminal activity, and suicide. This is more important than ever before in today's troubled world. But what does making this connection mean? Based on Bowen family systems theory, Connecting with Our Children shows parents how to build the connection found in better relationships. Now parents have a new way to think about and respond to family problems. The author examines common concerns, such as:* How substance abuse can repeat through generations* Why fusions between family members drive conflict* How family anxiety can erupt into violence* Whether stepfamilies can create a new family unit* What roles faith and humor play in a family* How effective are special contributions made by connections with grandparentsNumerous practical examples and stories illustrate familiar situations and concerns, so that parents can learn how to deal with the often confusing situations surrounding their children, as well as those within their own lives. With a different perspective, parents can learn to overcome these difficulties, creating a stronger family and a happier, more open relationship between parent and child.",

        "Authors": "By Somer, Elizabeth",
        "Description": "Recent surveys indicate that women are more aware today of what constitutes a healthful diet than they were ten years ago. However, although more than 70 percent of women acknowledge that a nutritious diet is an important factor in reducing the risk of serious health problems, many still lack the skills and resources to make informed food and nutrient choices. And while many understand that diet is related to the risk for certain diseases, few women are aware of the specific dietary components that lower that risk or how to incorporate the right foods and nutrients into their diet.Nutrition for Women: The Complete Guide is an accessible reference for and about women - the first of its kind to provide a bottom-line summary of scientific nutrition research from more than 2,000 studies on the issues pertinent to women's health. In a clear, concise style it converts scientific jargon into simple, understandable terms while dispelling the myths and presenting the facts.Nutrition can be more than a bit confusing. Diets abound, from the anti-heart-disease diet to the PMS diet to the hundreds of weight-loss diets. Women who want to simplify this nutrition puzzle and combine the best advice into one diet with recommendations for particular illnesses or life stages should consult this invaluable guide. Part I presents the Healthy Woman's Diet and all the skills necessary for adapting one's habits to a more healthful eating style. In this section there are also ten key ideas for making successful changes and staying motivated. Part II introduces the latest research on the role nutrition plays in the many stages of a woman's life, including pregnancy, menopause, and the senior years. Part III offers easy-to-read summaries and dietary recommendations based on current research for a wide range of disorders from AIDS to yeast infections. Many accessible charts, tables, and worksheets will enable readers to make informed decisions about and necessary changes to their diets.",

        "Description": "Torrance Spoor is your normal California teenager - a handsome high school athlete with strong sexual yearnings and a long-absent father. The invitation to spend some time with his dad - the Baron Malcolm Spoor - comes as a surprise. But what awaits Torrance at his father's windswept estate is far worse than he could ever imagine.Welcome to the world of The Living One, one of the most frightening, clever, and suspenseful novels of the year. In this tour-de-force debut, Lewis Gannett spins a spellbinding story that summons up magic, body thievery, killer dogs, ESP wars, and lusty, genre-defying sex - straight, gay, and forms yet unnamed.The Spoors are the ultimate dysfunctional family. Wealthy, shamelessly extravagant, and impossibly attractive, they are also cursed. The curse has been handed down from father to son for seven hundred years, ever since the Crusades, when a bizarre and mystifying event created a recurring pattern of madness and death. As Baron Malcolm Spoor prepares for his demise, he must pass on the family riches - and its traditions - to his estranged son.But Malcolm and Torrance both have secrets they would rather keep to themselves, secrets that are nearly revealed when a shadowy government scientist picks up psychic readings from the Spoor estate and a bohemian teacher becomes personally involved with Torrance. These two begin an investigation into the extraordinary life of Baron Malcolm Spoor, and their findings are truly horrifying.Updating elements of the epistolary novel popularized in Dracula, Lewis Gannett tells his gothic story through the inventive use of videotape transcripts, diary entries, and historical records. Vivid, scary, mythic, and engrossing, The Living One explores the terrifying dimensions of family guilt, aging, and the murderous tensions between fathers and sons. Lewis Gannett has written a startling and thrilling novel that marks the debut of an original new voice in fiction.",

        "Description": "No career in modern American letters is at once so brilliant, varied, and controversial as that of Norman Mailer. In a span of more than six decades, Mailer has searched into subjects ranging from World War II to Ancient Egypt, from the march on the Pentagon to Marilyn Monroe, from Henry Miller and Mohammad Ali to Jesus Christ. Now, in The Castle in the Forest, his first major work of fiction in more than a decade, Mailer offers what may be his consummate literary endeavor: He has set out to explore the evil of Adolf Hitler. The narrator, a mysterious SS man who is later revealed to be an exceptional presence, gives us young Adolf from birth, as well as Hitler\u2019s father and mother, his sisters and brothers, and the intimate details of his childhood and adolescence.A tapestry of unforgettable characters, The Castle in the Forest delivers its playful twists and surprises with astonishing insight into the nature of the struggle between good and evil that exists in us all. At its core is a hypothesis that propels this novel and makes it a work of stunning originality. Now, on the eve of his eighty-fourth birthday, Norman Mailer may well be saying more than he ever has before.",

        "Description": "ENGLISH LANGUAGE ENGLISH LITERATURE Grace Freedson, Series Editor An exciting new series of study guides that lets each student design a course of study pitched to his or her individual needs and learning style Each year, more than one million U.S. high school students take one or more advanced placement (AP) exams, and, according to official projections, that number will continue to rise in the years ahead. That is because AP exams confer important benefits on those who do well on them. High AP scores are indispensable to gaining admission to most elite colleges. They provide students with a competitive edge when competing for grants and scholarships. And they allow students to bypass required university survey courses, saving on skyrocketing tuition fees. Designed to coincide perfectly with the most current AP exams, Five Steps to a 5 on the Advanced Placement Examinations guides contain several advanced features that set them above all competitors. Each guide is structured around an ingenious Five-Step Plan. The first step is to develop a study plan, the second builds knowledge, the third and fourth hone test-taking skills and strategies, and the fifth fosters the confidence students need to ace the tests. This flexible study tool is also tailored to three types of students. For the more structured student there is a \"Month-by-Month\" approach that follows the school year and a \"Calendar Countdown\" approach that begins with the new year. For students who leave studying to the last minute \"Basic Training\" covers the basics in just four weeks. Other outstanding features include:  Sample tests that closely simulate real exams  Review material based on the contents of the most recent tests  Icons highlighting important facts, vocabulary, and frequently-asked questions  Boxed quotes offering advice from students who have aced the exams and from AP teachers and college professors  Websites and links to valuable online test resources, along with author e-mail addresses for students with follow-up questions  Authors who are either AP course instructors or exam developers",

        "Description": "Sixteen-year-old Nomi Nickel longs to hang out with Lou Reed and Marianne Faithfull in New York City\u2019s East Village. Instead she\u2019s trapped in East Village, Manitoba, a small town whose population is Mennonite: \u201cthe most embarrassing sub-sect of people to belong to if you\u2019re a teenager.\u201d East Village is a town with no train and no bar whose job prospects consist of slaughtering chickens at the Happy Family Farms abattoir or churning butter for tourists at the pioneer village. Ministered with an iron fist by Nomi\u2019s uncle Hans, a.k.a. The Mouth of Darkness, East Village is a town that\u2019s tall on rules and short on fun: no dancing, drinking, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, recreational sex, swimming, make-up, jewellery, playing pool, going to cities or staying up past nine o\u2019clock.As the novel begins, Nomi struggles to cope with the back-to-back departures three years earlier of Tash, her beautiful and mouthy sister, and Trudie, her warm and spirited mother. She lives with her father, Ray, a sweet yet hapless schoolteacher whose love is unconditional but whose parenting skills amount to benign neglect. Father and daughter deal with their losses in very different ways. Ray, a committed elder of the church, seeks to create an artificial sense of order by reorganizing the city dump late at night. Nomi, on the other hand, favours chaos as she tries to blunt her pain through \u201cdrugs and imagination.\u201d  Together they live in a limbo of unanswered questions.Nomi\u2019s first person narrative shifts effortlessly between the present and the past. Within the present, Nomi goes through the motions of finishing high school while flagrantly rebelling against Mennonite tradition. She hangs out on Suicide Hill, hooks up with a boy named Travis, goes on the Pill, wanders around town, skips class and cranks Led Zeppelin. But the past is never far from her mind as she remembers happy times with her mother and sister \u2014 as well as the painful events that led them to flee town. Throughout, in a voice both defiant and vulnerable, she offers hilarious and heartbreaking reflections on life, death, family, faith and love.Eventually Nomi\u2019s grief \u2014 and a growing sense of hypocrisy \u2014 cause her to spiral ever downward to a climax that seems at once startling and inevitable. But even when one more loss is heaped on her piles of losses, Nomi maintains hope and finds the imagination and willingness to envision what lies beyond.Few novels in recent years have generated as much excitement as A Complicated Kindness. Winner of the Governor General\u2019s Award and a Giller Prize Finalist, Miriam Toews\u2019s third novel has earned both critical acclaim and a long and steady position on our national bestseller lists. In the Globe and Mail, author Bill Richardson writes the following: \u201cThere is so much that\u2019s accomplished and fine. The momentum of the narrative, the quality of the storytelling, the startling images, the brilliant rendering of a time and place, the observant, cataloguing eye of the writer, her great grace. But if I had to name Miriam Toews\u2019s crowning achievement, it would be the creation of Nomi Nickel, who deserves to take her place beside Daisy Goodwill Flett, Pi Patel and Hagar Shipley as a brilliantly realized character for whom the reader comes to care, okay, comes to love.\u201dThis town is so severe. And silent. It makes me crazy, the silence. I wonder if a person can die from it. The town office building has a giant filing cabinet full of death certificates that say choked to death on his own anger or suffocated from unexpressed feelings of unhappiness. Silentium. People here just can\u2019t wait to die, it seems. It\u2019s the main event. The only reason we\u2019re not all snuffed at birth is because that would reduce our suffering by a lifetime. My guidance counsellor has suggested to me that I change my attitude about this place and learn to love it. But I do, I told her. Oh, that\u2019s rich, she said. That\u2019s rich. . .We\u2019re Mennoni",

Stock, an expert on the implications of recent advances in reproductive biology, clearly shows that neither governments nor religious groups will be able to stop the coming trend of choosing an embryo's genes.",

In China Shakes the World, the former China bureau chief of the Financial Times, James Kynge, traces these tremors from Beijing to Europe to the Midwest as China\u2019s ravenous hunger for jobs, raw materials, energy, and food -- and its export of goods, workers, and investments -- drastically reshape world trade and politics.Delving beyond mere recitation of by-now-familiar statistics, Kynge\u2019s on-the-ground reporting provides alternative explanations for China's explosive transformation, revealing many of the usual reasons given for its growth to be myths. Most important for the future, he details China\u2019s deep, systemic weaknesses -- rampant fraud, crippling environmental crises, a corrupt banking system, faltering government institutions, a rapidly aging population -- that threaten even greater global disruptions. And he demonstrates the profound consequences of those weaknesses for American manufacturers, oil companies, banks, and ordinary consumers.Through dramatic stories of entrepreneurs and visionaries, factory workers and store clerks at the heart of this global phenomenon, China Shakes the World explains how China\u2019s breakneck rise occurred, the extraordinary problems the country now faces, and the consequences of both for the twenty-first century.",

        "Authors": "By Armstrong, Lance (FRW), Bruyneel, Johan, and Strickland, Bill",
        "Description": "On the tour and inside the mind of Johan Bruyneel, the winningest team leader in cycling history and the mastermind behind the success of the world\u2019s most celebrated champion, Lance ArmstrongJohan Bruyneel knows what it takes to win. In 1998, this calculating Belgian and former professional cyclist looked a struggling rider and cancer survivor in the eye and said, \u201cLook, if we\u2019re going to ride the Tour, we might as well win.\u201d In that powerful phrase a dynasty was born. With Bruyneel as his team director, Lance Armstrong seized a record seven straight Tour de France victories. In the meantime, Bruyneel innovated the sport of cycling and went on to prove he could win without his superstar -- in 2007 he took the Tour de France title with a young new team and a lot of nerve, sealing his place in sports history forever.    We Might as Well Win takes readers behind the scenes of this amazing nine-year journey through the Alps and the Pyrenees, revealing a radical recipe for winning that readers can adapt from the bike to the boardroom to life. We witness Bruyneel\u2019s near-death crash and comeback as a rider. We are privy to the many ways he and Armstrong outsmarted their opponents. We listen in on the team\u2019s race radios to hear the secret strategies that inspire greatness from a disparate team. We learn how to make sure \"not winning\" isn\u2019t the same as \"losing\" as Bruyneel struggles to prove himself -- post-Armstrong -- with new riders, new strategies, and skeptics around every corner.    Whether mounting a difficult climb, or managing a team of thirty riders and forty support staff from a miniature car hurtling along narrow European roads, or looking a future legend in the eye and willing him to believe, Bruyneel is, and has always been, the consummate winner. Readers will relish this inside tour.",

His fall from a cliff is the latest accident in a string of mishaps, and although nothing tangible points to foul play, FBI agent John Lau has his suspicions. What he needs is evidence - and the best forensic expert in the business, his friend anthropologist Gideon Oliver, the Skeleton Detective.Gideon likes his java strong and his bones ancient, dry, and dusty. But the body he must examine had lain in the tropical sun for a week before it was found, and then buried native-style, without a casket. If this case is not exactly Gideon's cup of...well, tea, it is not the state of the remains that bothers him. It's the real human ugliness he suspects he'll soon unearth.To make matters worse, Gideon finds trouble in paradise: a most unwelcoming local police commandant, a strange reluctance by the Blue Devil owners to uncover any wrong-doing, and the lack of an exhumation order. Sneaking into a graveyard with a shovel and flashlight isn't his idea of a professional analysis. And what he finds six feet under will prove the ultimate test of his skills: a subtle clue that points to foul play, and bones so puzzling that they have Gideon stumped...for a while. Now Gideon must cut to the heart of a crime to find the motive that may have percolated through a family for decades - and brewed a taste for murder.",

        "Title": "The End of Food",
        "Authors": "By Roberts, Paul",
        "Description": "Paul Roberts, the best-selling author of The End of Oil, turns his attention to the modern food economy and finds that the system entrusted to meet our most basic need is failing. In this carefully researched, vivid narrative, Roberts lays out the stark economic realities behind modern food and shows how our system of making, marketing, and moving what we eat is growing less and less compatible with the billions of consumers that system was built to serve. At the heart of The End of Food is a grim paradox: the rise of large-scale food production, though it generates more food more cheaply than at any time in history, has reached a point of dangerously diminishing returns. Our high-volume factory systems are creating new risks for food-borne illness, from E. coli to avian flu. Our high-yield crops and livestock generate grain, vegetables, and meat of declining nutritional quality. While nearly one billion people worldwide are overweight or obese, the same number of people\u2014one in every seven of us\u2014can\u2019t get enough to eat. In some of the hardest-hit regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the lack of a single nutrient, vitamin A, has left more than five million children permanently blind. Meanwhile, the shift to heavily mechanized, chemically intensive farming has so compromised soil and water that it\u2019s unclear how long such output can be maintained. And just as we\u2019ve begun to understand the limits of our abundance, the burgeoning economies of Asia, with their rising middle classes, are adopting Western-style, meat-heavy diets, putting new demands on global food supplies. Comprehensive in scope and full of fresh insights, The End of Food presents a lucid, stark vision of the future. It is a call for us to make crucial decisions to help us survive the demise of food production as we know it. Paul Roberts is the author of The End of Oil, which was a finalist for the New York Public Library&#39;s Helen Bernstein Book Award in 2005. He has written about resource economics and politics for numerous publications, including the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, Harper\u2019s Magazine, and Rolling Stone, and lectures frequently on business and environmental issues.",

        "Title": "Three Nights In August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager",
        "Authors": "By Bissinger, H. G.",
        "Description": "A Pulitzer Prize-winning author captures baseball\u2019s strategic and emotional essences through a point-blank account of one three-game series viewed through the keen eyes of legendary manager Tony La Russa. Drawing on unprecedented access to a manager and his team, Bissinger brings the same revelatory intimacy to major-league baseball that he did to high school football in his classic besteller, Friday Night Lights.Three Nights in August shows thrillingly that human nature -- not statistics -- can often dictate the outcome of a ballgame. We watch from the dugout as the St. Louis Cardinals battle their archrival Chicago Cubs for first place, and we uncover delicious surprises about the psychology of the clutch, the eccentricities of pitchers, the rise of video, and the complex art of retaliation when a batter is hit by a pitch. Through the lens of these games, Bissinger examines the dramatic changes that have overtaken baseball: from the decline of base stealing to the difficulty of motivating players to the rise of steroid use. More tellingly, he distills from these twenty-seven innings baseball's constants -- its tactical nuances, its emotional pull.During his twenty-six years of managing, La Russa won more games than any other current manager and ranks sixth all-time. He has been named Manager of the Year a record five times and is considered by many to be the shrewdest mind in the game today. For all his intellectual attainments, he\u2019s also an antidote to the number-crunching mentality that has become so modish in baseball. As this book proves, he's built his success on the conviction that ballgames are won not only by the numbers but also by the hearts and minds of those who play.",

In this dazzling work of suspense, Sarah Dunant interweaves parallel narratives that are stretched taut with tension even as they raise difficult questions about love, trust, and accountability. We are challenged, unnerved, and ultimately exhilarated as Dunant redefines the boundaries of the psychological thriller.",

Mars hasn't won any popularity contests among his fellow officers, but his commitment to his job and his investigative talents have gotten him a plumb assignment: Special Detective in charge of the First Response Unit, reporting directly to the chief.On a winter morning, when Mars is called to the scene of a homicide near the outskirts of town, his first thought is that a homeless drunk passed out in the wrong place on a freezing cold night. What he finds turns out to be much more menacing, a nightmare case involving a teenage girl from the right side of the tracks.With few clues and increasing pressure from the mayor on down to apprehend the killer, Mars is forced to turn away from the details of the crime on the bluffs and instead focus on the victim herself. Mary Pat Fitzgerald seemed to have a storybook lifestyle, at least from the outside. With a little digging, however, it becomes clear that appearances can be deceiving. Mars and his partner, Nettie Frisch, turn up some provocative clues in the search to uncover the truth about the young woman's lonely death-- but can they trust them?Third Person Singular is a multilayered screamer of a debut that will have readers breathlessly awaiting KJ Erickson's next effort.",

When sixteen-year-old Nouf goes missing, along with a truck and her favorite camel, her prominent family calls on Nayir al-Sharqi, a desert guide, to lead a search party. Ten days later, just as Nayir is about to give up in frustration, her body is discovered by anonymous desert travelers. But when the coroner\u2019s office determines that Nouf died not of dehydration but from drowning, and her family seems suspiciously uninterested in getting at the truth, Nayir takes it upon himself to find out what really happened to her. This mission will push gentle, hulking, pious Nayir, a Palestinian orphan raised by his bachelor uncle, to delve into the secret life of a rich, protected teenage girl\u2014in one of the most rigidly gender-segregated of Middle Eastern societies. Initially horrified at the idea of a woman bold enough to bare her face and to work in public, Nayir soon realizes that if he wants to gain access to the hidden world of women, he will have to join forces with Katya Hijazi, a lab worker at the coroner\u2019s office. Their partnership challenges Nayir, bringing him face to face with his desire for female companionship and the limitations imposed by his beliefs. It also ultimately leads them both to surprising revelations. Fast-paced and utterly transporting, Finding Nouf offers an intimate glimpse inside a closed society and a riveting literary mystery.",

Of course, everyone in town knew better than to mess with the Claybornes. The brothers, four of the toughest hombres in the West, had once been a mismatched gang of street urchins. But they had found an abandoned baby girl in a New York City alley, named her Mary Rose, headed West, and raised her to be a lady. Through the years the Claybornes had become a family, held together by loyalty and love if not by blood -- when they suddenly faced the crisis that could tear them apart. That crisis came to town with Lord Harrison Stanford MacDonald. In his fine clothes, he looked every inch a dude. Mary Rose figured that if she didn't interfere, this handsome Englishman would get himself killed, so she took him home to the Clayborne ranch to ask her brothers to turn him into a cowboy. She didn't suspect MacDonald was a chameleon, not the greenhorn he appeared to be. He'd prove fast with a gun, quick with his fists, and capable of commanding the Claybornes's respect -- if not their trust. He'd also soon be desperately in love with Mary Rose. She returned his affection blissfully and wholeheartedly...until MacDonald revealed a secret that challenged everything she believed about her love, herself, and her life. Now Mary Rose's search for identity and meaning would begin, sending her to England, to the family she lost long ago. Her soul hungered for the freedom of the American West, but she was being drawn away from all she cared about by the need to know her past...and by her uncertain but still potent love for MacDonald. Torn between conflicting loyalties, Mary Rose wasn't sure who she really was, or where she belonged...questions that could only be answered if she listened to the truth within her heart.",
