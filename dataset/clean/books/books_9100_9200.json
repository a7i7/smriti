        "Description": "What mystery haunts the Rutledge Estate, one of the most prestigious vineyards in Napa Valley? What secret has Kelly Douglas, one of prime time's most popular newscasters, kept locked inside for so many years? In Tangled Vines, Janet Dailey's riveting new novel, the lush vineyards of Napa Valley, California, and the city lights of Manhattan are the backdrops for the mesmerizing story of television news personality Kelly Douglas and vintner Sam Rutledge, and the passions and secrets that surround their lives and the Napa wine country.Kelly Douglas, the host of a new prime-time magazine show, is on the brink of achieving her lifelong dream of becoming a nightly news anchor. Hers is a modern-day Cinderella story: long ago she pulled herself out of a desperately unhappy childhood in rural Napa Valley, escaped from her abusive, alcoholic father, and transformed herself from \"four-eyed and fat\" Lizzie Dougherty into the chic and successful Kelly Douglas. Her lustrous auburn hair, impeccable taste and wardrobe, dedication to hard work, and uncanny talent for being in the right place at the right time have propelled her to journalistic stardom - and she has never once looked back.By chance, Kelly returns to Napa Valley to do a feature story. There she becomes entangled in the lives of Katherine Rutledge, the matriarch of the famous Rutledge Estate Winery, and her grandson, the ruggedly handsome vintner Sam Rutledge, who epitomizes the family motto: If you're a Rutledge, wine, not blood, runs through your veins. But the Rutledge motto also applies to Katherine's estranged son, Gil, who owns a competing winery in the valley. The bonds of blood and wine are put to the ultimate test, and the bitter rivalry between Katherine and Gil is further fueled by the desire of them both to form a joint venture with the illustrious Bordeaux winery of Baron Fougere in France - with both mother and son vowing to stop at nothing to attain their goal.Meanwhile, Kelly finds herself progressively drawn to Sam's subtle yet sexy charm. Up until now, Kelly's fast-track schedule has never allowed her any time for love - should she be falling for Sam Rutledge now, at the most crucial moment of her career?When a murder on the Rutledge Estate is linked to Kelly's abusive father, from whom she has long been estranged, her entire world turns upside down, and she is forced to confront her hidden past and her hidden pain. Amid the turmoil, Kelly and Sam discover their extraordinary passion and poignant love for each other. But can Kelly afford to let Sam see the battered child within? Will she jeopardize her promising new life and career, or risk losing the one man she loves in order to protect her secret past?Tangled Vines is an enthralling story of passion and intrigue that combines the romance and drama of the wine country with the healing power of love to create Janet Dailey's most exciting and rewarding novel yet.",

Billy Bryan has seen his share. A former minor-league catcher for the Washington Senators, Bryan is now a retired high school teacher, widowed with a grown daughter, and \"coming to the end of many things.\" Then a long-forgotten scrapbook stirs memories of a distant past--and beckons him on a reluctant journey to relive his own extraordinary role in history. . . .In 1947, Bryan is playing winter ball in Cuba, immersing himself in the decadent nightlife of Havana, and dreaming of someday \"making it\" to the majors. But his future on the diamond is as uncertain as Cuba itself, a country where rumblings of revolution hang in the air like a high fly ball to left. Then one fateful night Bryan witnesses a young student radical named Fidel hurl pitch after amazing pitch. So begins Billy's tug-of-war with destiny--to score a victory for the game he worships, win the heart of the woman he loves, or make his mark in a world racing toward revolution. . . .",

His new office mate, Niagara Spense, is six feet tall, has cloth-brown hair and glasses thicker than George's, and wears a different color of the same homemade dress every day. George cannot stop thinking about her, despite the fact that he is married and the father of two. They come to electrical engineering from opposite directions: while George is wedded to facts and the physical world, Niagara considers electricity a mysterious life force flowing behind walls and throughout the nerves of the body.Soon the gangly girl scientist tells George of her quest for electrical evidence of life after death - audible fossils she calls them - and her revelation compounds George's crises of faith in his puny belief system, his marriage, and his career. Ready to leave his icemakers and butter softeners behind, George finds he has a personal stake in Niagara's astral projections. By the end of this extraordinary novel, Niagara has opened many doors for George, and ultimately she opens him up to the cosmos, where he learns the truth that allows him to claim the life that is his.",

        "Description": "For every woman trying to strike that impossible balance between work and home-and pretending that she has-and for every woman who has wanted to hurl the acquaintance who coos admiringly, \"Honestly, I just don't know how you do it,\" out a window, here's a novel to make you cringe with recognition and laugh out loud. With fierce, unsentimental irony, Allison Pearson's novel brilliantly dramatizes the dilemma of working motherhood at the start of the twenty-first century.Meet Kate Reddy, hedge-fund manager and mother of two. She can juggle nine different currencies in five different time zones and get herself and two children washed and dressed and out of the house in half an hour. In Kate's life, Everything Goes Perfectly as long as Everything Goes Perfectly.  She lies to her own mother about how much time she spends with her kids; practices pelvic floor squeezes in the boardroom; applies tips from Toddler Taming to soothe her irascible boss; uses her cell phone in the office bathroom to procure a hamster for her daughter's birthday (\"Any working mother who says she doesn't bribe her kids can add Liar to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9\"); and cries into the laundry hamper when she misses her children's bedtime.In a novel that is at once uproariously funny and achingly sad, Allison Pearson captures the guilty secret lives of working women-the self-recrimination, the comic deceptions, the giddy exhaustion, the despair-as no other writer has. Kate Reddy's conflict --How are we meant to pass our days? How are we to reconcile the two passions, work and motherhood, that divide our lives? --gets at the private absurdities of working motherhood as only a novel could: with humor, drama, and bracing wisdom.",

        "Description": "The most important document in the history of rock 'n' roll since the liner notes to Killroy Was Here.(This paperback includes a new P.S. section with author interviews, insights, features, suggested readings, and more.)Never Mind the Pollacks, the first novel from acclaimed humorist Neal Pollack, is an epic history of rock-and-roll told through the eyes of two rival rock critics. The novel spans the decades from the 1940s to the present day, and includes such real-life characters as Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Bruce Springsteen, Joey Ramone, Patti Smith, Kurt Cobain, and many more. Pollack deploys his trademark roasting of literary pomposity, but his narrative transcends mere parody to become full-fledged social satire. He takes on the icons of popular music and their biographers, true-life rock books and historical fiction. There has never been a book quite like this one, particularly since it contains more than two-dozen original songs written by the author.The life story of the book's main character, \"Neal Pollack,\" is uniquely American. The only son of Jewish immigrant parents, he shows an aptitude early in life for rock criticism. Prodded by the legendary Sam Phillips and haunted by a ghostly, mysterious blues man, deeply disturbed by his mother's illegitimate marriage to Jerry Lee Lewis, he leaves his Memphis boyhood behind to become a folk troubadour in Greenwich Village. Six broken hearts, two liver transplants, and a lot of cocaine orgies later, he meets his ultimate destiny in a surprise ending that will shock anyone who wasn't paying attention to the early chapters. With Never Mind the Pollacks, Neal Pollack establishes himself as one of the most important novelists of his generation who isn't named Jonathan.",

        "Title": "The Conspiracy of Ignorance: The Failure of American Public Schools",
        "Authors": "By Gross, Martin L.",
        "Description": "In this global age of information, nothing should alarm American parents and leaders more than the failure of our public schools. As quality education of the young becomes the true international currency, that commodity--unfortunately--is in grievously short supply. American schoolchildren lag far behind students in most of the developed world, scoring nineteenth out of twenty-one countries in a recent math competition. On domestic exams, almost forty percent are reading at \"below basic\" levels.  In this candid, provocative, and comprehensive study of the public school system, from kindergarten through high school, bestselling author Martin L. Gross charges that the Education Establishment has nurtured a conspiracy of ignorance that promotes and defends lower standards of teaching and learning designed to maintain its monopoly on our public schools.  The verdict is in: The teaching vocation has failed to produce competent teachers, penalizing its 45 million public school students. The problem is that the Establishment--from a tight group of teachers, principals, superintendents, education professors, and counselors, to the state commissioners of education--selects mainly academically inferior teacher candidates, and ignoring time-tested fundamentals, trains them in such dubious concepts as \"educational psychology\" and a \"whole language\" method of reading that ignores proper grammar and spelling.  In a series of shocking revelations, Mr. Gross describes how the typical teacher learns little more than a two-year community college graduate; how the average college-bound student scores fifty points higher on his SAT exams than most of his teachers; how the great majority of school teachers are less trained in their own specialties than other college graduates in the same field; and how \"untrained\" teachers in both private and public schools perform better than Establishment graduates. The usual remedies--from federal aid to smaller class sizes--have done nothing to alleviate these problems because they make no attempt to challenge the Education Establishment's control. In a powerful Bill of Indictment, Mr. Gross shows how the teaching vocation, aided by its unions, maintains a self-perpetuating cycle of low performance, and he offers his own detailed prescription for change that will raise public education to the level our children--and society--need and deserve.  The Conspiracy of Ignorance is a lucid, persuasive argument based on a wealth of research that asks the questions most education observers are afraid to ask. It is a book desperately needed to ensure that American schoolchildren will have a chance to prosper as educated and productive citizens in today's world.",

Would a \u201csafe\u201d America even look like America anymore?One of the few journalists to penetrate the new counter terror initiative, Matthew Brzezinski offers an insider\u2019s look at the new technology, laws, tactics, and persistent vulnerabilities of the post-9/11 era. The result is this startling, sometimes controversial look at what it will take to achieve genuine homeland security and what it may be like to live inside Fortress AmericaIs this what a safe America will look like?\u2022 Cameras at airport ticket counters that can tell if you are stressed \u2022 Satellites and surveillance equipment that can see through the walls of your home\u2022 Computer programs capable of spotting abnormal behavior \u2022 National ID \u201csmart\u201d cards encoding your personal, financial, and medical information required for electronic police spot checksIn the aftermath of September 11, a massive effort has been launched to protect us from another terrorist attack. But the costs of safeguarding our country will require not only unprecedented amounts of funding, but dramatic changes in the way Americans lead their everyday lives. Is this the new price of freedom? \u2022 Mandatory chips installed in all cell phones and automobiles that can locate you instantly within a dozen yards\u2022 Patriot II legislation that can arbitrarily revoke citizenship and allow terrorist sympathizers to vanish without a trace\u2022 Transponder implants that could be injected into the bodies of prisoners, foreign nationals, and perhaps one day all US citizens\u2026Such high-tech measures are not the stuff of science fiction but in many cases are already being implemented. As Brzezinski discovers, similar measures have been in use for years in security states like Israel. But will Americans trade liberty for security? Will they have a choice? And can even the most radical measures insure that a 9/11 style attack won\u2019t happen again? From an unheeded warning six years before the WTC disaster to dramatic war-game scenarios secretly conducted at Andrews Air Force Base and chilling on-site simulations of actual attacks, Fortress America paints a sobering picture of the future of freedom\u2026and what life may be like in a maximum security state.",

        "Description": "When Bob Greene went home to central Ohio to be with his dying father, it set off a chain of events that led him to knowing his dad in a way he never had before\u2014thanks to a quiet man who lived just a few miles away, a man who had changed the history of the world.Greene's father\u2014a soldier with an infantry division in World War II\u2014often spoke of seeing the man around town. All but anonymous even in his own city, carefully maintaining his privacy, this man, Greene's father would point out to him, had \"won the war.\" He was Paul Tibbets. At the age of twenty-nine, at the request of his country, Tibbets assembled a secret team of 1,800 American soldiers to carry out the single most violent act in the history of mankind. In 1945 Tibbets piloted a plane\u2014which he called Enola Gay, after his mother\u2014to the Japanese city of Hiroshima, where he dropped the atomic bomb.On the morning after the last meal he ever ate with his father, Greene went to meet Tibbets. What developed was an unlikely friendship that allowed Greene to discover things about his father, and his father's generation of soldiers, that he never fully understood before. Duty is the story of three lives connected by history, proximity, and blood; indeed, it is many stories, intimate and achingly personal as well as deeply historic. In one soldier's memory of a mission that transformed the world\u2014and in a son's last attempt to grasp his father's ingrained sense of honor and duty\u2014lies a powerful tribute to the ordinary heroes of an extraordinary time in American life.What Greene came away with is found history and found poetry\u2014a profoundly moving work that offers a vividly new perspective on responsibility, empathy, and love. It is an exploration of and response to the concept of duty as it once was and always should be: quiet and from the heart. On every page you can hear the whisper of a generation and its children bidding each other farewell.",

        "Description": "A critic recently said of T. Coraghessan Boyle, \"More happens in one of Boyle's stories than in most post-Victorian novels.\" This is precisely the case in Without a Hero, fifteen stunning stories that each, in its own way, displays a virtuosity and versatility rare in literary America. In this, his fourth story collection, Boyle takes chance after chance, even to the point of reexamining the ethos of Ernest Hemingway, one of the masters of the form. In \"Big Game,\" the wild animal safari takes place not in Africa but on a pay-per-shoot ranch in Southern California and includes an elephant hunt and its vivid consequences. There are echoes here of Hemingway's classic \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\" and Green Hills of Africa, but Boyle's hunting story is drawn for the age of ecology rather than an age without limits.Throughout, Boyle displays an astonishing range as he zooms in on such American specimens as the college football player who knows only defeat; the entrepreneur who creates a center for acquisitive disorders; the couple in search of the last toads on earth; and the boy caught between the ingenuousness of childhood and the cynicism of adulthood in \"The Fog Man.\" In some of these stories, Boyle makes you laugh out loud; in others you come closer to understanding the human condition because of the way he cuts to the secret places in his people's hearts. Here is the author of the highly praised 1993 novel, The Road to Wellville, entering a richer and deeper phase in his writing life, his stories bursting with what the Los Angeles Times has called his \"ferocious, delicious imagination, often darkly satirical and always infatuated with language.\"",

(\"Even lying there - shot, bleeding - Mary Jo had grabbed Joey's T-shirt. I yanked it out of her hand.\") Joey Buttafuoco, Mary Jo's husband, has denied that he ever had an affair with Amy, as she alleges. Amy has said that he set her up as a prostitute (\"I started to have trouble keeping my food down on days I had customers\"), and that he was intimately involved in the plot to murder his wife (\"Joey said not to call him afterward. He'd call me\"). Joey has denied these allegations. Currently serving a five-to-fifteen-year sentence for first-degree assault (\"If you're a celebrity prisoner, they make life very tough on you\"), Amy has finally told her side of the story, in full and fascinating detail, to veteran journalist Sheila Weller.The lurid tale of sex, money, teenage prostitution, murder for hire, drugs, suicide attempts, divorce, and pornographic videotapes has rocked the country and scarred the affluent Long Island, New York, communities where the Fishers and the Buttafuocos live. Mary Jo's health is shattered, Joey Buttafuoco's image has suffered, the Fishers have filed for divorce, Amy is in prison - and the aftershocks of this volatile case continue to grip the nation. Amy Fisher, who says she made love with \"Joey B.\" in her parents' home, in a motel, in the apartment above his body shop, and on his boat - Double Trouble - remembers the good times...\"I went to the appointed place, waited until I saw the Double Trouble chugging up, shooting foam on either side. As Joey cruised in and lifted me on board, I felt like Grace Kelly with Bing Crosby in that old movie where they sang 'True Love.'\"What are the real secrets of this high-school truant and runaway who left Mary Jo Buttafuoco lying on her front porch in a pool of blood? Everyone has an opinion about Amy Fisher. To some, she's the living nightmare of suburban America; to others, she's a traumatized victim of abuse, and a plaything of ruthless adults who used her for their salacious pleasure. Here, at last, Amy Fisher's shocking and heartwrenching story is completely revealed....",

        "Authors": "By Howard, Philip K.",
        "Description": "Americans are bursting with frustration at government. Thick rule books dictate results that almost never make sense. Government can barely fix potholes or fire an employee who doesn't show up for work, much less accomplish important goals. With the best of intentions, government hands out new legal rights like land grants, usually to victims of history or circumstance, but fails to notice that it then loses its ability to balance everyone's welfare.The land of freedom has become a legal maze of obligation, ritual, and obeisance. With dozens of vivid stories - some humorous, some tragic - Philip Howard peels away the basic assumptions of a system that is driving Americans crazy.Law began infiltrating the nooks and crannies of our lives in the 1960s, crowding out our common sense. Rules replaced thinking. Process replaced responsibility. One false idea lay at the bottom of these developments: that human judgment should he banned from anything to do with law. We fell for the idea that all could be laid out in a tidy legal system where decisions were predetermined, social choices premade.The Death of Common Sense grinds up sacred legal cows, one after another. Again and again, it shows how they lead to the bureaucracy and laws that frustrate and humiliate every citizen. Then, Howard turns his scrutiny to the fears that have kept us obedient and powerless in our daily decisions, and sets us on a course to take back control of our lives.",

Thrust together by their husbands' business partnership -- and by a guilty secret -- Julia and Fay develop an intense bond that is nonetheless something less than intimacy, a relationship in which we see our own uneasy compromises, not only with other people, but with life itself.",

Should you really bother investing in that Five-Year CD?\"Tonight,\" in the unforgettable words of The Artist Formerly Known as Prince, \"We're gonna party like it's 1999.\" The end is near...or at least nearer than it used to be, says Garner. Humanity is wracked by millennial panic and apocalyptic anticipation -- or if it isn't already, just wait until it reads Garner's latest (and last?). In it, he sets off on a slightly-to-the-South-of-skeptical pilgrimage in search of the truth behind the end times predictions.",

In the tradition of Lorrie Moore, Susan Perabo's slightly off-center lens looks hard at the banal and the bizarre, and at the human condition, where she finds extraordinary magic within the smallest of gestures.
