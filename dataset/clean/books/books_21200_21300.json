        "Description": "A Seasoned Journalist Chases Down the Biggest Story in HistoryIs there credible evidence that Jesus of Nazareth really is the Son of God?Retracing his own spiritual journey from atheism to faith, Lee Strobel, former legal editor of the Chicago Tribune, cross-examines a dozen experts with doctorates from schools like Cambridge, Princeton, and Brandeis who are recognized authorities in their own fields.Strobel challenges them with questions like How reliable is the New Testament? Does evidence for Jesus exist outside the Bible? Is there any reason to believe the resurrection was an actual event?Strobel's tough, point-blank questions make this Gold Medallion-winning book read like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But it's not fiction. It's a riveting quest for the truth about history's most compelling figure.What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ?'Lee Strobel probes with bulldog-like tenacity the evidence for the truth of biblical Christianity.'Bruce M. Metzger, Ph.D., Professor of New Testament, Emeritus, Princeton Theological Seminary'Lee Strobel asks the questions a tough-minded skeptic would ask.

        "Description": "\"Let her go to Italy!\" he cried. \"Let her meddle with what she doesn't understand! Look at this letter! The man who wrote it will marry her, or murder her, or do for her somehow. He's a bounder, but he's not an English bounder. He's mysterious and terrible. He's got a country behind him that's upset people from the beginning of the world.\"When a young English widow takes off on the grand tour and along the way marries a penniless Italian, her in-laws are not amused. That the marriage should fail and poor Lilia die tragically are only to be expected. But that Lilia should have had a baby -- and that the baby should be raised as an Italian! -- are matters requiring immediate correction by Philip Herriton, his dour sister Harriet, and their well-meaning friend Miss Abbott.In his first novel, E. M. Forster anticipated the themes of cultural collision and the sterility of the English middle class that he would develop in A Room with a View and A Passage to India. Where Angels Fear to Tread is an accomplished, harrowing, and malevolently funny book, in which familiar notions of vice and virtue collapse underfoot and the best intentions go mortally awry.",

        "Description": "\"My mother never writes. So when the mail arrived that day, I was not expecting to find a letter from her. There was no warning.\"Between generations of women, there are always secrets--relationships kept hidden, past events obscured, true feelings not spoken. But sometimes the truth is so primal it must be told. Now, with haunting lyricism and emotional clarity, Arlene Chai has written an exquisite novel about a family of women who break their silence. At the center of The Last Time I Saw Mother is the singular story of a woman who suddenly learns she is not who she thinks she is.Caridad is a wife and mother, a native of the Philippines living in Sydney, Australia. Out of the blue Caridad's mother summons her home. Although she is not ill, Thelma needs to talk to her daughter -- to\u00a0\u00a0reveal a secret that has been weighing heavily on her for years.It is a tale that Caridad in no way suspects. She stopped asking questions about the past long ago; her mother's constant reluctance to answer finally subdued her curiosity. Now, it is through the words of Thelma, her aunt Emma, and her cousin Ligaya, that Caridad will learn the startling truth and attempt to recapture what has been lost to her. Arlene Chai tells their versions of the story in their own voices, each one distinct, moving, and magical. As each woman tells her part of their family's hidden history, Caridad hears at last the unspoken stories--the joys and sorrows that her parents kept to themselves, and the never forgotten tragedy of the war years, when Japan's brutal occupation and civilian deprivations helped destroy a country and its history. The Last Time I Saw Mother is about mothers and daughters. It is about a cultural identity born of Spanish, Chinese, and Filipino influence. And it is about the healing power of truth. Arlene Chai is one of the most stunning new novelists in years. She takes us to a place we have never been before.",

Marianne Dresser brings together the likes of Pema Chodron, Tsultrim Allione, and bell hooks, 30 women in all, who are doing just that. Writers, nuns, scholars, priests--even a martial arts master and a private investigator--discuss women in Buddhism in a range of essays. Several pieces question the suppression of emotion required for selflessness, appealing to the undeniable reality of day-to-day living. Others discuss their experiences as women in Buddhism, whether as nuns or as lay practitioners. Still others address the history of women in Buddhism, racial questions, meditation, poetry, compassion, social activism, and sexual orientation. Most of these writers have been in Buddhism for two or three decades and offer a wealth of experience and insights, targeted at women readers but no less valuable to men.",

        "Authors": "By Nacos, Brigitte Lebens",
        "Description": "Over the last fifteen years, incidents of anti-American terrorism have become increasingly common. Until recently, however, Americans believed that such violent acts would not occur on American soil. The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City, the epicenter of American finance, was a rude awakening.Terrorism and the Media comes to readers at a crossroad in American history, when U.S. national security experts anticipate more acts of international terrorism at home and abroad.The author contends that terrorists are very successful in exploiting the vital link between the news media, public opinion, and decision-making - a pattern which might be called a calculus of violence. Terrorism works because media coverage of such incidents influence the American public to support government responses that protect the victims of terrorism, most of all hostages, at the expense of the national interest. Moreover, presidents and other high-level officials tend to follow public opinion.Written in a lively, journalistic style, the book is based on scholarly research of such shocking incidents as the Iranian hostage crisis, the hijackings of the Achille Lauro and TWA Flight 847, and the bombings at Rome airport and on Pan Am Flight 103. In the process, the author casts a critical eye on the practices of such media giants as The CBS Evening News and The New York Times.Terrorism and the Media includes an assessment of the World Trade Center bombing and considers the similarities and differences between terrorism inside and outside a targeted country.This first book to focus exclusively on the consequences of terrorism against the United States will be essential reading for politicians, journalists, and other professionals who confront these issues directly. It will be equally informative for the general reader interested in terrorist groups and the immense problems they cause even for the most powerful nation in the world.",

        "Authors": "By Davidson, Keay and Smoot, George",
        "Description": "In April 1992, a discovery was made that changed the way we view the world. Dr. George Smoot, distinguished cosmologist and adventurer, whose quest for cosmic knowledge had taken him from the Brazilian rain forest to the South Pole unveiled his momentous discovery, bringing to light the very nature of the universe. For anyone who has ever looked up at the night sky and wondered, for anyone who has ever longed to pull aside the fabric of the universe for a glimpse of what lies behind it. Wrinkles in Time is the story of Smoot's search to uncover the cosmic seeds of the universe.Wrinkles in Time is the Double Helix of cosmology, an intimate look at the inner world of men and women who ask. \"Why are we here?\" It tells the story of George Smoot's dogged pursuit of the cosmic wrinkles in the frozen wastes of Antarctica, on mountaintops, in experiments borne aloft aboard high-altitude balloons, U-2 spy planes, and finally a space satellite.Wrinkles in Time presents the hard science behind the structured violence of the big bang theory through breathtakingly clear, lucid images and meaningful comparisons. Scientists and nonscientists alike can follow with rapt attention the story of how, in a fiery creation, wrinkles formed in space ultimately to become stars, galaxies, and even greater delicate structures. Anyone can appreciate the implications of a universe whose end is written in its beginnings - whose course developed according to a kind of cosmic DNA, which guided the universe from simplicity and symmetry to ever-greater complexity and structure.As controversial as it may seem today, Wrinkles in Time reveals truths that, in an earlier century, would have doomed its proclaimers to the fiery stake. For four thousand years some people have accepted the Genesis account of cosmic origin; for most of this century, scientists debated two rival scientific explanations known as the steady state and big bang theories. And now, Wrinkles in Time tells what really happened.",

How had she really chosen Noah and Nadia and Ethan and Julian? And why did they make such a good team? It was a surprise to a lot of people when Mrs. Olinski's team won the sixth-grade Academic Bowl contest at Epiphany Middle School. It was an even bigger surprise when they beat the seventh grade and the eighth grade, too. And when they went on to even greater victories, everyone began to ask: How did it happen? It happened at least partly because Noah had been the best man (quite by accident) at the wedding of Ethan's grandmother and Nadia's grandfather. It happened because Nadia discovered that she could not let a lot of baby turtles die. It happened when Ethan could not let Julian face disaster alone. And it happened because Julian valued something important in himself and saw in the other three something he also valued. Mrs. Olinski, returning to teaching after having been injured in an automobile accident, found that her Academic Bowl team became her answer to finding confidence and success. What she did not know, at least at first, was that her team knew more than she did the answer to why they had been chosen. This is a tale about a team, a class, a school, a series of contests and, set in the midst of this, four jewel-like short stories -- one for each of the team members -- that ask questions and demonstrate surprising answers.",

In London to join the staff of SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force), Liza is ready to keep D-Day plans away from the German forces-even if it means her life.  Paired with former New York homicide detective Major Sam Taggart distractions begin to pile up almost immediately when two of Liza's co-workers, both mistresses of high- ranking generals, suspiciously turn up dead. As Liza and Taggart trek from the blitzkrieg-ravaged London to vast, elegant country estates, it becomes clear that more than one conspiracy is afoot-and that the very success of the war may rest in their hands.

Now he turns his eye to an array of technologies that could change our relationship not with the rest of nature but with ourselves. He explores the frontiers of genetic engineering, robotics, and nanotechnology\u2014all of which we are approaching with astonishing speed\u2014and shows that each threatens to take us past a point of no return. We now stand, in Michael Pollan's words, \"on a moral and existential threshold,\" poised between the human past and a post-human future. McKibben offers a celebration of what it means to be human, and a warning that we risk the loss of all meaning if we step across the threshold. Instantly acclaimed for its passion and insight, this wise and eloquent book argues that we cannot forever grow in reach and power\u2014that we must at last learn how to say, \"Enough.\"",

Bush to the White House -- from the death of his sister, which helped to shape his character, to the conversion experience that changed his life. Matching detailed new research with thoughtful analysis, God and George W. Bush is the definitive look at the spiritual life of this American president.",

Kinsey Millhone is at it again in \"N\" is for Noose\u2014another thrilling adventure from the #1 New York Times bestselling author Sue GraftonKinsey Millhone should have done something else--she should have turned the car in the direction of home. Instead, she was about to put herself in the gravest jeopardy of her career.Tom Newquist had been a detective in the Nota Lake sheriff's office--a tough, honest cop respected by everyone. When he died suddenly, the townsfolk were saddened but not surprised: Just shy of sixty-five, Newquist worked too hard, smoked too much, and exercised too little. That plus an appetite for junk food made him a poster boy for an American Heart Association campaign. Newquist's widow didn't doubt the coroner's report. But what Selma couldn't accept was not knowing what had so bothered Tom in the last six weeks of his life. What was it that had made him prowl restlessly at night, that had him brooding constantly? Selma Newquist wanted closure, and the only way she'd get it was if she found out what it was that had so bedeviled her husband. Kinsey should have dumped the case. It was vague and hopeless, like looking for a needle in a haystack. Instead, she set up shop in Nota Lake, where she found that looking for a needle in a haystack can draw blood.

Or so it seemed until his former insurance agent spotted him in the bar of a dusty little resort halfway between Cabo San Lucas and La Paz.\"In truth, the facts about Wendell Jaffe had nothing to do with my family history, but murder is seldom tidy and no one ever said revelations operate in a straight line. It was my investigation into the dead man's past that triggered the inquiry into my own, and in the end the two stories became difficult to separate.\"Five years ago, when Jaffe's thirty-five-foot Fuji ketch was found drifting off the Baja coast, it seemed a sure thing he'd gone overboard. The note he left behind admitted he was flat broke, his business bankrupt, his real estate gambit nothing but a huge Ponzi scheme about to collapse, with criminal indictment certain to follow. When the authorities soon after descended on his banks and his books, there was nothing left: Jaffe had stripped the lot.\"Given my insatiable curiosity and my natural inclination to poke my nose in where it doesn't belong, it was odd to realize how little attention I'd paid to my own past. I'd simply accepted what I was told, constructing my personal mythology on the flimsiest of facts.\"But Jaffe wasn't quite without assets. There was the $500,000 life insurance policy made out to his wife and underwritten by California Fidelity. With no corpse to prove death, however, the insurance company was in no hurry to pay the claim. Dana Jaffe had to wait out the statutory five years until her missing husband could be declared legally dead. Just two months before Wendell Jaffe was sighted in that dusty resort bar, California Fidelity finally paid in full. Now they wanted the truth. And they were willing to hire Kinsey Millhone to dig it up.As Kinsey pushes deeper into the mystery surrounding Wendell Jaffe's pseudocide, she explores her own past, discovering that in family matters as in crime, sometimes it's better to reserve judgment.\"J\" is for judgment: the kind we're quick to make and often quicker to regret.\"J\" Is for Judgment: Kinsey Millhone's tenth excursion into the dark places of the heart where duplicity is the governing rule and murder the too-frequent result.\"A\" Is for Alibi\"B\" Is for Burglar\"C\" Is for Corpse\"D\" Is for Deadbeat\"E\" Is for Evidence\"F\" Is for Fugitive\"G\" Is for Gumshoe\"H\" Is for Homicide\"I\" Is for Innocent\"J\" Is for Judgment\"K\" Is for Killer\"L\" is for Lawless\"M\" Is for Malice\"N\" Is for Noose\"O\" Is for Outlaw\"P\" Is for Peril \"Q\" Is for Quarry\"R\" Is for Ricochet \"S\" Is for Silence \"T\" Is for Trespass\"U\" Is for Undertow \"V\" Is for Vengeance \"W\" Is for Wasted \"X\"",

Edgar Hoover, Kinky Friedman, the author, has Kinky Friedman, the detective (in real life, the two are not related), rush to the aid of a lovely young woman, only to find that he is up to his shin splints in trouble of a disconcerting kind.Soon after Polly Price hires him to find her missing husband, Kinky smells a rat. But it's not until he's been shot by the D.C. police and locked in a burning limousine by a Chicago chauffeur that he realizes he may be the one with his tail in a trap. Then, when Michael McGovern, longtime friend and loyal member of the Village Irregulars, complains first of being watched by mysterious men, then of getting threatening phone calls from a dead gangster named Leaning Jesus, and finally disappears - and along with him, the lovely Polly - Kinky comes to the only conclusion that conceivably could link these disparate events: the FBI is after him!",

A high-ranking colleague, who sits on the bank's main board, has teamed up with a Russian financier in order to provide Jon with one of the key elements vital to the success of his ingenious scheme. The deal goes spectacularly wrong and Jon's world collapses. As the Russians desperately attempt to recover their lost millions, Jon is thrown into a deadly game of cat and mouse. From the seedy nightspots of downtown NYC to the plush yacht clubs of the Hamptons, pastoral aristocratic England, and Southern Australia's endless beaches, past lovers, new menaces, and numerous apparently accidental deaths line his trail.

        "Description": "When Buster Bear comes to live in the Green Forest, the amiable bully stirs up quite a commotion, for bears haven't lived in the forest for years.

Set in a timeless world of bubbling brooks, blue skies, and green groves, the story also teaches valuable lessons on the dangers of greed, pride, and insensitivity. The text, printed in large, easy-to-read type, is enhanced by six charming illustrations, based on the originals by Harrison Cady.",
