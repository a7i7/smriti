Cesare is a cosseted Italian boy, raised in a prosperous town where his family has lived for five hundred years; Beth, an ambitious American dreamer born to hippies and raised on a commune. The events of September 11 serve as a catalyst for the unfolding of their story, in which passion struggles against the inexorable force of patria. An examination of the intersection between Europe and America, the old and the new, L'America is above all a remarkable evocation of the dizzying, life-changing power of first love. The novel of the American in Europe has a long and lustrous pedigree. Now Martha McPhee joins the ranks of its most impressive practitioners.",

        "Description": "In recent years a noticeable trend toward harmonizing the distinct worldviews of science and religion has become increasingly popular. Despite marked public interest, many leading scientists remain skeptical that there is much common ground between scientific knowledge and religious belief. Indeed, they are often antagonistic. Can an accommodation be reached after centuries of conflict?In this stimulating collection of articles on the subject, Paul Kurtz, with the assistance of Barry Karr and Ranjit Sandhu, have assembled the thoughts of scientists from various disciplines. Among the distinguished contributors are Sir Arthur C. Clarke (author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and numerous other works of science fiction); Nobel Prize Laureate Steven Weinberg (professor of physics at the University of Texas at Austin); Neil deGrasse Tyson (Princeton University astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium); James Lovelock (creator of the Gaia hypothesis); Kendrick Frazier (editor of the Skeptical Inquirer); Steven Pinker (professor of psychology at MIT); Richard Dawkins (zoologist at Oxford University); Eugenie Scott (physical anthropologist and executive director of the National Center for Science Education); Owen Gingerich (professor of astronomy at Harvard University); Martin Gardner (prolific popular science writer); the late Richard Feynman (Nobel Prize-winning physicist) and Stephen Jay Gould (professor of geology at Harvard University); and many other eminent scientists and scholars.Among the topics discussed are the Big Bang and the origin of the universe, intelligent design and creationism versus evolution, the nature of the \"soul,\" near-death experiences, communication with the dead, why people do or do not believe in God, and the relationship between religion and ethics.",

It is the case he has been waiting for, his first since being recruited to the city's Homicide Special squad.As soon as Bosch begins retracing Dr. Kent's steps, contradictions emerge. While Kent doesn't seem to have had ties to organized crime, he did have access to dangerous radioactive substances from just about every hospital in Los Angeles County. What begins as a routine homicide investigation opens up before Bosch into something much larger and more dangerous and much more urgent.Breaking in a new rookie partner and chasing his first fresh case in years, Bosch is soon in conflict not just with the LAPD brass but also with FBI hotshots who are convinced that the case is too important for the likes of the LAPD. Harry's onetime lover Rachel Walling is among the federal agents frantically working the case, making Bosch's job all the more complicated. Guarding one slim advantage, he relentlessly follows his own instincts, hoping they are still true enough to solve the crime - and to save all of Los Angeles from a deadly hazard.",

        "Description": "Having survived a long and desperate adventure in the Great South Sea, Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin return to England to very different circumstances. For Jack it is a happy homecoming, at least initially, but for Stephen it is disastrous: his little daughter appears to be autistic, incapable of speech or contact, while his wife, Diana, unable to bear this situation, has disappeared, her house being looked after by the widowed Clarissa Oakes.Much of The Commodore takes place on land, in sitting rooms and in drafty castles, but the roar of the great guns is never far from our hearing. Aubrey and Maturin are sent on a bizarre decoy mission to the fever-ridden lagoons of the Gulf of Guinea to suppress the slave trade. But their ultimate destination is Ireland, where the French are mounting an invasion that will test Aubrey's seamanship and Maturin's resourcefulness as a secret intelligence agent.The subtle interweaving of these disparate themes is an achievement of pure storytelling by one of our greatest living novelists.",

        "Description": "William Diehl has written five previous best-sellers, each of them superb, selling millions of copies around the world. Yet nothing he has done before can prepare you for Primal Fear.In Chicago, a sainted archbishop is slain, mutilated, and dismembered in his rectory. Moments after the murder, an angelic-looking young man, Aaron Sampler, is found crouched in a confessional, covered with blood and clutching a butcher knife - but swearing he is innocent of the heinous act.Enter attorney Martin Vail. Vail is so good at his job, he's managed to infuriate every judge, prosecutor, and politician in Illinois. Now they're paying him back - by forcing him to defend Aaron Sampler and plead a case he cannot possibly win. But Vail is no ordinary lawyer, and the legal team he assembles is no ordinary backup squad. There's Jack Scalding, and ex-judge whose main passions in life are playing the horses and arguing the law; Tommy Goodman, Vail's top investigator, an ex-boxer studying to be a lawyer so he can follow in Vail's footsteps; Molly Arrington, a young and beautiful psychiatrist, and the one who is the first to understand the extraordinary truth that lies behind the killing of the archbishop.Once Vail begins to do what he does best - figure all the angles - so begins a court battle worthy of Presumed Innocent and a nightmare of terror every bit as horrifying as The Silence of the Lambs.A featured alternate selection of the Literary Guild, and soon to be a major motion picture from Paramount Pictures, Primal Fear is a novel of brilliant suspense, memorable characters, and superb plotting, setting it apart as the thriller of the year.",

        "Description": "All the women of the Bible offers a rich biographical perspective on evey female figure in scripture -- including the famous, the little-known, and even the unnamed. In more that 300 engaging and insightful portraits, Edith Deen brings alive the saints and sorceresses, queens and servants, mothers and daughters, wives and widows whose profound influence is felt through-out the Bible. \"You can almost trace light and darkness in the Bible by the women themselves,\"she writes. \"Hannah, praying mother of Samuel, gave birth to a son who became the first great Hebrew prophet. And, of course, there was the mother of Jesus. On the other hand, Jezebel and Herodias were vile influences, the first tearing apart the northern kingdom of Israel, the second causing John the Baptist to be beheaded.\"Combining thorough detail with a lively and dramatic narrative, All of the Women of the Bible portrays the real women behind the Biblical stories and shows how, in their human struggles and triumphs, they are very much like the women of today. With each major biography identified by Bible chapter and verse and prefaced by a key passage of scripture, this is an ideal resources for teachers, Bible students, preachers, and writers, as well as anyone who wants to learn what it was really like to be a woman in Biblical times.",

        "Description": "Finally\u2014the ultimate diet for fast, safe weight loss, lifelong health, and longer life, based on more than twenty years of research and the latest findings on appetite and weight. Metabolic specialist Ron Rosedale, M.D., has designed the Rosedale Diet to regulate the powerful hormone leptin, which controls appetite and weight loss by telling the brain when to eat, how much to eat\u2014and when to stop. New research shows that leptin may be one of the body's most important hunger control mechanisms. Control leptin, and you control your weight.Most people's leptin levels are out of control, causing them to overeat and to store fat rather than burn it. The only way to flip the \"hunger switch\" back to normal is through a diet high in healthy fats and low in carbohydrates, saturated fat, and trans-fatty acids often found in processed food\u2014plus just 15 minutes of daily exercise.Dr. Rosedale's 21-day diet plan is simple: Just select from the many foods on his \"A\" list, including \"healthy-fat\" foods such as avocados, nuts, olives, lobster, crab, shrimp, goat cheese, Cornish game hen, venison, and more. Then gradually add foods from the \"B\" list, such as steak, lamb chops, fruits, beans, and so on. A 28-day menu plan and more than 100 recipes, such as Dilled Salmon and Fresh Asparagus, Gingery Chicken Soup, Lasagna, Black Bean Wrap, Raspberry Mousse Cake, and French Silk Pie, make eating the Rosedale way deliciously easy.Weight loss is just the beginning. The Rosedale Diet will make you feel satisfied, reduce cravings, and put you in control of your \"sweet tooth.\" It can even help eliminate or reduce heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions associated with \"natural\" aging, as many of Dr. Rosedale's patients can attest. You'll find inspiring stories from them\u2014and the power to control your weight and improve your health\u2014in this groundbreaking book.",

However, if we listen closely, we hear Him provide not an answer but rather another question- \"Am I Not Still God?\" It is perhaps the only question that matters. How you answer it may shape the rest of your life. Using examples from her own experience, Kathy Troccoli shares how God is unconcerned with explaining Himself-instead He is concerned with demonstrating love and developing a holy character in us. She details God as the ultimate shelter in the face of the most violent storms. As these painful trials are allowed into our life He promises we will never suffer in vain.",

Not because we want to look at ourselves, but because we want to be that close to him--to the mysterious, wonderful, invisible God who reveals himself even in temptations, trials, and dangers.Can you see God when your husband gets a speeding ticket? What about when your daughter wrecks her grandfather\u2019s truck? Is he watching while you drive down the road in a Chevette held together by wire coat hangers?With her usual sense of southern humor, Chonda Pierce invites us to open our eyes and our sense of humor as she teaches us how to catch God at work, especially in the most unlikely places. Like the time she got her ears pierced--contrary to the advice of her mother. She walked out of the jewelry store, saw two nuns, took them as a sign from God, and never wore pierced earrings again.Chonda the comedian has touched thousands of women around the country, from stage or on video. \"To see or hear her is to love her,\" is the unanimous response. But in her writing, Chonda brings a whole new depth of insight into her humor--humor that enables readers to dispel all gloom and experience the joy of the closeness of God in their everyday lives.",

        "Description": "A meeting place for writers, artists, models, stars of stage, screen, and corporate boardrooms, a luxurious restaurant whose fabulous concoctions and timeless decor have often been imitated but never matched, Harry's Bar in Venice has remained one of the world's most renowned watering holes for more than sixty years. Here for the first time is the history of this most venerable of saloons, as entrenched a fixture of the Venetian landscape as the Doge's Palace, the Basilica, and the Piazza San Marco.Beginning with its founding in 1931 by a humble but enterprising Venetian barman named Giuseppe Cipriani and a wealthy American named Harry Pickering, we follow Giuseppe and his son Arrigo through World War II, when Harry's Bar was requisitioned by the fascists and turned into a mess hall for Mussolini's navy, while the real festive meals were served at the Cipriani house; the raucous liberation in 1945, when Allied Army officers took up virtual residence at the bar and tossed Giuseppe around the dining room like a rugby ball; and up through the postwar years, when Harry's Bar became a virtual club for the world's glitterati.Here too are the stories behind the Ciprianis' great inventions, from the \"carpaccio\" appetizer, which has become a generic term for thinly sliced raw meat or raw fish with a white sauce, to the bellini, the now famous pink cocktail made of pureed white peaches and Italian champagne. The author also treats us to the adventures and misadventures of Harry's New York nephews, Harry Cipriani on Fifth Avenue, the only restaurant that was ever stolen from its director between lunch and dinner, and the Bellini in the old Taft Hotel.",

        "Description": "Since September 11, 2001, Seymour M. Hersh has riveted readers -- and outraged the Bush Administration -- with his stories in The New Yorker, including his breakthrough pieces on the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Now, in Chain of Command, he brings together this reporting, along with new revelations, to answer the critical question of the last three years: how did America get from the clear morning when hijackers crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to a divisive and dirty war in Iraq?Hersh established himself at the forefront of investigative journalism thirty-five years ago when he broke the news of the massacre at My Lai, Vietnam, for which he won a Pulitzer Prize. Ever since, he's challenged America's power elite by publishing the stories that others can't, or won't, tell. In expos\u00e9s on subjects ranging from Saudi corruption to  nuclear black marketeers and -- months ahead of other journalists -- the White House's false claims about weapons of mass destruction, Hersh has cemented his reputation as the indispensable reporter of our time.In Chain of Command, Hersh takes an unflinching look behind the public story of President Bush's \"war on terror\" and into the lies and obsessions that led America into Iraq. He reveals the connections between early missteps in the hunt for Al Qaeda and disasters on the ground in Iraq. The book includes a new account of Hersh's pursuit of the Abu Ghraib story and of where, he believes, responsibility for the scandal ultimately lies. Hersh draws on sources at the highest levels of the American government and intelligence community, in foreign capitals, and on the battlefield for an unparalleled view of a crucial chapter in America's recent history. With an introduction by The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick, Chain of Command is a devastating portrait of an Administration blinded by ideology and of a President whose decisions have made the world a more dangerous place for America.",

Her Omma had committed the sin of lying with an American soldier, and producing not just a bastard but a honhyol - a mixed-race child, considered worth less than nothing.Left at a Christian orphanage in postwar Seoul like garbage, bleeding and terrified, Kim unwittingly embarked on the next phase of her life when she was adopted by a childless Fundamentalist pastor and his wife in the United States. Unfamiliar with Western customs and language, but terrified that she would be sent back to the orphanage, or even killed, Kim trained herself to be the perfect child. But just as her Western features doomed her in Korea, so her Asian features served as a constant reminder that she wasn't good enough for her new, all-white environment.After escaping her adoptive parents' home, only to find herself in an abusive and controlling marriage, Kim finally made a break for herself by having a daughter and running away with her to a safer haven - something Omma could not do for her.",

Meanwhile, over the past century, we have developed lifestyles firmly rooted in the promise of an endless, cheap supply. In this book, David Goodstein, professor of physics at Caltech, explains the underlying scientific principles of the inevitable fossil fuel shortage we face. He outlines the drastic effects a fossil fuel shortage will bring down on us. And he shows that there is an important silver lining to the need to switch to other sources of energy, for when we have burned up all the available oil, the earth's climate will have moved toward a truly life-threatening state. With its easy-to-grasp explanations of the science behind every aspect of our most urgent environmental policy decisions, Out of Gas is a handbook for the future of civilization.",

        "Title": "Catherine the Great: Life and Legend",
        "Authors": "By Alexander, John T.",
        "Description": "One of the most colorful characters in modern history, Catherine II of Russia began her life as a minor German princess, until the childless Empress Elizabeth and Catherine's own scheming mother married her off to the Grand Duke Peter of Russia at age sixteen. By thirty-three, she had overthrown her husband in a bloodless coup and established herself as Empress of the multinational Russian Empire, the largest territorial political unit in modern history.     Portrayed both as a political genius who restored to Russia the glory it had known in the days of Peter the Great and as a despotic foreign adventuress who usurped the Russian throne, murdered her rivals, and tyrannized her subjects, she was, by all accounts, an extraordinary woman. Catherine the Great, the first popular biography of the empress based on contemporary scholarship, provides a vivid portrait of Catherine as a mother, a lover, and, above all, an extremely savvy ruler. Concentrating on her long reign (1762-96), John Alexander examines all aspects of Catherine's life and career:  the brilliant political strategies by which she won the acceptance of a nationalistic elite;  her expansive foreign policy;  the domestic reforms with which she revamped the Russian military, political structure, and economy;  and, of course, her infamous love life.     Beginning with an account of the dramatic palace revolt by which Catherine unseated her husband and a background chapter describing the circumstances of her early childhood and marriage, Alexander then proceeds chronologically through the thirty-four years of her reign. Presenting Catherine in more human terms than previous biographers have, Alexander includes numerous quotations from her reminiscences and notes.  We learn, for instance, not only the names and number of her lovers, but her understanding of what many considered a shocking licentiousness.  \"The trouble is,\" she wrote, \"that my heart would not willingly remain one hour without love.\"     The result of twenty years' research by one of America's leading narrative historians of modern Russia, this truly impressive work offers a much-needed, balanced reappraisal of one of history's most scandal-ridden figures.",

But she's never looked better....Becky Bloomwood has a fabulous flat in London's trendiest neighborhood, a troupe of glamorous socialite friends, and a closet brimming with the season's must-haves. The only trouble is that she can't actually afford it\u2014not any of it. Her job writing at Successful Savings not only bores her to tears, it doesn't pay much at all. And lately Becky's been chased by dismal letters from Visa and the Endwich Bank\u2014letters with large red sums she can't bear to read\u2014and they're getting ever harder to ignore. She tries cutting back; she even tries making more money. But none of her efforts succeeds. Becky's only consolation is to buy herself something ... just a little something....Finally a story arises that Becky actually cares about, and her front-page article catalyzes a chain of events that will transform her life\u2014and the lives of those around her\u2014forever. Sophie Kinsella has brilliantly tapped into our collective consumer conscience to deliver a novel of our times\u2014and a heroine who grows stronger every time she weakens. Becky Bloomwood's hilarious schemes to pay back her debts are as endearing as they are desperate. Her \"confessions\" are the perfect pick-me-up when life is hanging in the (bank) balance.",

        "Title": "Cracking the Japanese Market: Strategies for Success in the New Global Economy",
        "Authors": "By Morgan, James C.",
        "Description": "Global business today is played by new rules -- many of which are being written by the Japanese and their remarkably successful companies. Because the Japanese are redefining business as we know it, Western companies expecting to profit from the new global marketplace must first learn to compete and succeed against the Japanese in Japan.  James C. Morgan, Chairman of Applied Materials, Inc., the leading supplier of advanced processing equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry which does about forty percent of its business in Japan, and J. Jeffrey Morgan, who has worked in Tokyo on the \"inside\" at Mitsui & Co., Japan's oldest trading conglomerate, contend that apathy and ignorance have prevented many Western companies from capitalizing on the enormous opportunities for business in Japan. In this brilliant examination of Japanese markets, companies, and business practices -- with special emphasis on the establishment of Applied Materials Japan -- the Morgans, father and son, assert that success in the world of Japanese business is determined by two factors: technology and relationships. Candidly discussing their own mistakes and failures as well as their triumphs, the authors provide invaluable insights into the specific challenges facing Western companies in establishing a presence in Japan: problems in financing the venture, product design and production, marketing and distribution, and most important, creating long-term relationships or \"putting on a Japanese face.\" The extraordinary success of Applied Materials Japan -- hailed by George Bush on the campaign trail in 1988 as \"a model for all America\" -- is testimony to the valuable lessons to be learned from this book.  The Morgans provide a clearly written, step-by-step framework for reorienting company thinking, revising corporate strategy, and revitalizing any organization for world class competitiveness. Using vivid examples of Western companies that have both succeeded admirably and failed miserably in Japan, Cracking the Japanese Market is a straightforward examination of what it takes to compete successfully there -- and by extension in the world today.",
