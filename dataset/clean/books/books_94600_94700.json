        "Authors": "By Stein, Lincoln and Maceachern, Doug",
        "Description": "Apache is the most popular web server on the Internet because it is free, reliable, and extensible. The  availability of the source code and the modular design  of Apache makes it possible to extend web server  functionality through the Apache API.For the most part, however, the Apache API has only  been available to C programmers, and requires rebuilding the Apache server from source. mod_perl, the popular  Apache module used primarily for enhanced CGI performance,  changed all that by making the Apache API available to Perl programmers. With mod_perl, it becomes simple  to develop Apache modules with Perl and install them  without having to rebuild the web server.Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C shows how to extend  web server capabilities regardless of whether  the programming language is Perl or C. The  book explains the design of Apache, mod_perl, and the  Apache API. It then demonstrates how to use them to  perform for tasks like the following:Rewriting CGI scripts as Apache modules to  vastly improve performanceServer-side filtering of HTML documents, to embed special markup or code (much like SSI)Enhancing server log functionalityConverting file formats on the flyImplementing dynamic navigation barsIncorporating database access into CGI scriptsCustomizing access control and authorization to  block robots or to use an external database for passwordsThe authors are Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern. Lincoln is the successful author of How to Set Up and Maintain a World Wide web Site and the developer of the widely used Perl CGI.pm  module. Doug is a consultant and the creator of the innovative  mod_perl Apache module.",

Mario Batali's son boasts a preference for duck testicles. Peter Kaminsky's daughters won't eat anything at all. Mark Bittman reveals the four stages of learning to cook. Mark Kurlansky would love a woman to feed him, just once. Jim Harrison shows how good food and wine trump expensive cars and houses. Jesse Sheidlower searches for words to describe his vegetarianism to his kids. And Stephen King offers tips about what to cook when you don't feel like cooking. More men cook now than ever before, and this is the first book to celebrate those good eggs who toil behind the stove, trying to nourish and please. Their culinary adventures are accompanied by over sixty family-tested recipes, time-saving tips, and cookbook recommendations as well as an array of New Yorker cartoons. Plus, there are interviews with homestyle heroes cooking all across America--a fireman from Brooklyn,a football coach in Atlanta, a lawyer in Philadelphia, a bond trader in Los Angeles. What emerges is a book not just about food but about our changing families. It offers a newfound community for any man who proudly dons an apron and inspiration for those who have yet to pick up the spatula. \"--",

Now Duncan returns with another epic tour de force that surpasses all expectations.INK: The Book of All HoursOnce, in the depths of prehistory, they were human. But in a moment of brutal transfiguration, they became unkin, beings who possessed the power to alter reality by accessing the Vellum: a realm of eternity containing every possibility, every paradox, every heaven . . . and every hell. The Vellum became a battleground where forces of order and chaos fought across time and space. The ultimate weapon in that bloody war spanning through history and myth, dreams and memory, was The Book of All Hours, a legendary tome within which the blueprint for all reality is inscribed, a volume long lost amid the infinite folds of the Vellum.Until, in 2017, it was found by Reynard Carter, a young man with the blood of unkin in his veins.Until Phreedom Messenger and her brother, Thomas, were swept up in an archetypal dance of death and rebirth. Until a hermit named Seamus Finnan found the courage to re-forge his broken soul, and a self-proclaimed angel called Metatron unleashed a plague of AI bitmites.Now, in the aftermath of the apocalypse, several survivors search desperately for the remnants of themselves scattered across the Vellum like torn pages, determined to use the blood of the unkin to rewrite The Book of All Hours, and to forge a new destiny for themselves and all humanity. Reality will never be the same.",

        "Description": "Routers are the glue that connects the pieces of your network.  Even in the simplest networks, this isn't a simple task.  Routers have evolved into highly specialized computing platforms, with extremely flexible but complex capabilities.Managing IP Networks with Cisco Routers is a practical guide to setting up and maintaining a production network.  It discusses issues like how to select routing protocols and how to configure protocols to handle most common situations.  It also discusses less esoteric but equally important issues like how to evaluate network equipment and vendors and how to set up a help desk.  Although the book focuses on Cisco routers, and gives examples using Cisco's IOS, the principles discussed are common to all IP networks, regardless of the vendor you choose.This book is firmly grounded in the realities of day-to-day network management.  It's designed to solve real-world problems, like: \"How do I prevent my router from using unreliable information from other routers?\" \"How do I safeguard my router against attacks?\" \"How can I make my network more reliable?\"  If you're building or maintaining an IP network, you'll find this book indispensable.Topics covered include:Designing an IP networkEvaluating equipment and vendorsSelecting routing protocolsConfiguring common interior protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)Connecting to external networks and configuring exterior protocols (BGP)Ongoing network management: troubleshooting and maintenanceSecurity and privacy issues",

In Mobbed, Clark sends Regan \u201cdown the shore\u201d where they have both vacationed since childhood. But this trip turns out to be no vacation for Regan! PI Regan Reilly and her husband, Jack, head of the NYPD Major Case Squad, plan to spend the weekend at the Jersey shore with her parents. Regan\u2019s mother, suspense writer Nora Regan Reilly, will be celebrating her birthday on Saturday. But Regan\u2019s weekend gets off to an early start when she receives a phone call from her mother asking if she\u2019d hop on a train right away. Regan had just finished delivering bad news to a high school classmate.

Turns out Nora had also just spoken to an agitated high school classmate. Karen Frawley Fulton, who lives in San Diego, called Nora after learning her mother\u2019s plans for the day. To Karen\u2019s shock, Edna Frawley just sold their home at the Jersey shore and is having a garage sale to end all garage sales. Everything the beautiful young actress Cleo Paradise left behind when she recently rented the house is up for grabs. The irrepressible Edna even rented a plane to fly over the beach touting the sale, using Cleo\u2019s name as bait. Karen\u2019s heading East but asks Nora to please go to the house and, she hopes, curtail any other outrageous antics her mother probably has in mind. Nora agrees and asks Regan to join her. Regan and Nora arrive at the Frawley home to find a mob of garage-sale junkies waiting at the front gate.

        "Authors": "By Tippett, Krista",
        "Description": "Albert Einstein did not believe in a personal God. And his famous quip that \"God does not play dice with the universe\" was a statement about quantum physics, not a statement of faith. But he did leave behind a fascinating, largely forgotten legacy of musings and writings-some serious, some whimsical-about the relationship between science and religion and his own inquisitive reverence for the \"order deeply hidden behind everything\". Einstein's self-described \"cosmic religious sense\" is intriguingly compatible with twenty-first-century sensibilities. And it is the starting point for Einstein's God.Drawn from American Public Media's extraordinary program Speaking of Faith, the conversations in this profoundly illuminating book explore an emerging interface of inquiry-if not answers-between many fields of science, medicine, theology and philosophy. In her interviews with such luminaries as Freeman Dyson, Paul Davies, V. V. Raman, and Mehmet Oz, Krista Tippett draws out the connections between these realms, showing how even those most wedded to hard truths find spiritual enlightenment in the life of experiment and, in turn, raise questions that are richly theologically evocative. Whether she is speaking with celebrated surgeon and author Sherwin Nuland about the biology of the human spirit or questioning Darwin biographer James Moore about his subject's religious beliefs, Tippett offers a rare look at the way our best minds grapple with the questions for which we all seek answers.",

        "Authors": "By Sheehy, Gail (FRW) and Kravitz, Lee",
        "Description": "After losing his job, Lee Kravitz--a man who had always worked too hard and too much--took stock of his life and decided to spend an entire year making amends and reconnecting with the people and parts of himself he had neglected. Kravitz embarks on ten journeys, traveling everywhere from a refugee camp in Kenya to a monastery in California, and learning along the way that the things we let slip are exactly those that have the power to transform, enrich, enlarge, and complete us. Unfinished Business has prompted multiple speaking engagements, a blog on the Psychology Today Web site, and a groundswell of interest from readers sharing their own stories--the best of which are included in this paperback edition as further inspiration. Visit www.myunfinishedbusiness.com for reading guides and much more. Lee Kravitz grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, and attended Yale and Columbia universities. An award-winning journalist, he most recently was editor in chief of Parade magazine. He lives in New York City and Clinton Corners, New York,with his wife and three children.Praise for Unfinished Business: \"Kravitz writes with an inspiring sincerity. His experiences are so familiar that it would be hard for readers not to reflect on their own unfinished business--and want to tend to it.\"--Washington Post \"Kravitz used losing his job as a springboard to the human things he should have done. In so doing, he turned bad into bountiful. A great lesson for us all.\"--Mitch Albom, author of Have a Little Faith",

        "Title": "Photoshop CS2 RAW: Using Adobe Camera Raw, Bridge, and Photoshop to Get the Most out of Your Digital Camera",
        "Authors": "By Aaland, Mikkel",
        "Description": "The RAW file format is the uncompressed data file captured by a digital camera's electronic sensor.  When your camera saves an image in RAW format, settings like white balance, sharpening, contrast and saturation are not applied to the image but are saved instead in a separate header.  Because RAW files remain virtually untouched by in-camera processing, they are essentially the digital equivalent to exposed but undeveloped film.This makes RAW an increasingly popular format with amateur and professional digital photographers, because it affords greater flexibility and control during the editing process-if you know how to work with RAW files.Most digital camera manufacturers supply their own software for converting RAW data, as do some third party vendors.  Increasingly, however, the RAW converter of choice is a plug-in included in the latest version of Adobe Photoshop, the most popular and widely-used digital image editing tool in the world.  Adobe Photoshop CS2 is emerging as the best place to edit RAW images, and the best way to master this new format is with Photoshop CS2 RAW.An important book dedicated to working with RAW in Photoshop, this comprehensive guide features a unique design that helps readers grasp the subject through visual instruction and prompts.  The entire RAW process is explored, from shooting to using the Adobe plug-in converter and new Bridge navigation software.  The primary focus of Photoshop RAW is, as the title suggests, Photoshop editing technique: automating RAW workflow, correcting exposures, extending exposure range, manipulating grayscale and working with the new DNG (Digital Negative) open standard that Adobe supports.Presented by photographer Mikkel Aaland, a pioneer of digital photography and author of eight books, including O'Reilly's Photoshop for the Web and the award-winning Shooting Digital, Photoshop CS2 RAW investigates and instructs in an accessible visual style.  Required reading for professionals and dedicated photo hobbyists alike.",

        "Authors": "By Reynolds, Glenn",
        "Description": "There was a time in the not-too-distant past when large companies and powerful governments reigned supreme over the little guy. But new technologies are empowering individuals like never before, and the Davids of the world-the amateur journalists, musicians, and small businessmen and women-are suddenly making a huge economic and social impact.In Army of Davids, author Glenn Reynolds, the man behind the immensely popular Instapundit.com, provides an in-depth, big-picture point-of-view for a world where the small guys matter more and more. Reynolds explores the birth and growth of the individual's surprisingly strong influence in: arts and entertainment, anti-terrorism, nanotech and space research, and much more.The balance of power between the individual and the organization is finally evening out. And it's high time the Goliaths of the world pay attention, because, as this book proves, an army of Davids is on the rise.\"George Orwell feared that technology would enable dictators to enslave the masses. Glenn Reynolds shows that technology can empower individuals to determine their own futures and to defeat those who would enslave us. This is a book of profound importance-and also a darn good read.-MICHAEL BARONE, senior writer at U.S. News & World Report and author of Hard America, Soft America  \"Blogger extraordinaire Glenn Reynolds shows how average Americans can use new technologies to overcome the twin demons of corporate greed and incompetent government. Reynolds is a compelling evangelist for the power of the individual to change our world.-ARIANNA HUFFINGTON, author of Pigs at the Trough and Fanatics and FoolsA smart, fun tour of a major social and economic trend. From home-brewed beer to blogging, Glenn Reynolds is an engaging, uniquely qualified guide to the do-it-yourself movements transforming business, politics, and media.-VIRGINIA POSTREL, Forbes columnist and author of The Future and its Enemies and The Substance of StyleA student in her dorm room now commands the resources of a multi-million dollar music recording or movie editing studio of not so many years ago. The tools of creativity have been democratized and the tools of production are not far behind (Karl Marx take note).  Glenn Reynolds's beguiling new book tells the insightful story of how an 'army of Davids' is inheriting the Earth, leaving a trail of obsolete business models not to mention cultural, economic, and political institutions in its wake.-RAY KURZWEIL, scientist, inventor, and author of several books including The Singularity is Near'Must-read,' 'gotta have,' 'culture-changing' . . . I am suspicious of blurbs with such overused plugs. But Glenn Reynolds's An Army of Davids is in fact a must-read new book that you gotta have if you are going to understand the culture-changing forces that are unleashed and at work across the globe.-HUGH HEWITT, syndicated talk radio host and author of Blog and Painting the Map RedGlenn Reynolds has written an essential book for understanding how technology and markets are creating a bottom-up shift in power to ordinary people that is changing business, government, and our world. Packed with fresh ideas and adorned with graceful prose, An Army of Davids is a masterpiece.-JOE TRIPPI, author of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\"I cannot think of a better book for the average reader to understand just how the Web and other digital technologies are reversing the polarities of modern society-restoring many features of daily life lost with the Industrial Revolution, while at the same time inventing powerful new cultural institutions. And for those of us who make careers out of watching this transformation, no book",

        "Title": "The People Factor: Strengthening America by Investing in Public Service",
        "Authors": "By Bilmes, Linda and Gould, W. Scott",
        "Description": "Successful businesses have spent the past two decades retooling and rethinking how to manage their people better. Most big companies that have survived and prospered in the 21st century view employees as a vital strategic asset. In comparison, the U.S. federal government is a Stone Age relic, with its top-down bureaucracy, stovepiping of labor and responsibilities, and lack of training and investment in its own public servants. The inevitable result is a government not keeping up with the complex demands placed on it.  In T he People Factor, Linda Bilmes and Scott Gould present a blueprint for reinvigorating the public sector in order to deliver results for America. Their premise is that the federal government can achieve the same gains as the best private sector and military organizations by managing its people better. Their new vision for public service is based on \"The People Factor,\" a set of management tools drawn from best practices in successful companies, the military, and high-performing government agencies.  Part One of The People Factor book shows why the U.S. personnel system needs reform, revealing the high price of inaction.

In the autumn of the girls' sixteenth year, a secret love tempted Moira, allowing her to have her own taste of adventure, but it also damaged the intimate, intuitive relationship she'd always shared with her sister. Though Moira's adolescent struggles came to a tragic end nearly a decade ago, her brief flirtation with independence will haunt her sister for years to come.A LONE WOMANWhen Maeve Leahy lost her twin, she left home and buried her fun-loving spirit to become a workaholic professor of languages at a small college in upstate New York. She lives a solitary life now, controlling what she can and ignoring the rest\u2013the recurring nightmares, hallucinations about a child with red hair, the unquiet sounds in her mind, her reflection in the mirror.

Exactly how she wants it.A SHARED PASTUntil one night at an auction when Maeve wins a keris,a Javanese dagger that reminds her of her lost youth and happier days playing pirates with Moira in their father's boat. Days later, a book on weaponry is nailed to her office door, followed by the arrival of anonymous notes, including one that invites her to Rome to learn more about the blade and its legendary properties. Opening her heart and mind to possibility, Maeve accepts the invitation and, with it, also opens a window into her past.Ultimately, she will revisit the tragic November night that shaped her and Moira's destinies\u2013and learn that nothing can be taken at face value\u2013as one sister emerges whole and the other's score is finally settled.The Last Will of Moira Leahyis a mesmerizing and romantic consideration of the bonds of family, the impossibility of forgetting, and the value of forgiveness.",

Judge Barnett on Sundays, Sheriff Allred on Fridays, the doctor on Wednesdays (Mondays are Georgia's own). Each gentleman gets a night tailored to his particular tastes, each has been trained to leave a \"gift\" to help Georgia get by, and each one thinks he is Georgia's only secret lover.When Preacher Eugene Hendrix (Saturdays) decides he must confess their affair in front of his wife and the entire congregation, Georgia may be able to stop him in time. But one pin pulled out of her elaborately protected life may be all it takes to send the whole structure to hell in a hurry. Chin high, posture perfect, her Chanel handbag tucked firmly under her arm, Georgia sets out to save herself, her mama, and her particular notion of virtue from total ruin. Nothing in Six Points will ever be the same.Written with hilarity, insight, and affection for the many failings of man- and womankind, Georgia Bottoms plumbs the irrepressible workings of the rebellious human heart. It is proof anew of why Stephen King called Childress's previous novel, One Mississippi, the \"funniest novel I have read in ten years!\"",

The doors that open there lead Robert to the highest circles of Manhattan society during the heart of the Reagan boom where everything Robert has learned about women, through seduction and heartbreak, pays off. For a brief moment, he has it all-but the world in which he finds himself is not the world from which he comes, and a chance encounter with a beautiful girl from the old neighborhood-and the forgotten life she reawakens-threatens to unravel his carefully constructed new identity.",
