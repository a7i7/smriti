She tells us what is new and wonderful (over 50 restaurants and 100 bakers, cheesemongers, wine shops, and other food establishments have been added), what is old and still trustworthy, what will make us shake our heads with amazement, and what will comfort us with the knowledge that what we loved 20 years ago we can return to today. Included with the Fourth Edition are 50 recipes, 10 of which are new, and an expanded glossary so that readers will never be at a loss when they are facing a French menu.",

Kellerman has worked his magic again in this chilling masterpiece.The anonymous caller has an ominous tone and an unnerving message about something \u201creal dead . . . buried in your marsh.\u201d The eco-volunteer on the other end of the phone thinks it\u2019s a prank, but when a young woman\u2019s body turns up in L.A.\u2019s Bird Marsh preserve no one\u2019s laughing. And when the bones of more victims surface, homicide detective Milo Sturgis realizes the city\u2019s under siege to an insidious killer. Milo\u2019s first move: calling in psychologist Alex Delaware. The murdered women are prostitutes\u2013except the most recent victim; a brilliant young musician from the East Coast, employed by a wealthy family to tutor a musical prodigy, Selena Bass seems out of place in the marsh\u2019s grim tableau. Conveniently\u2013perhaps ominously\u2013Selena\u2019s blueblood employers are nowhere to be found, and their estate\u2019 s jittery caretaker raises hackles. But Milo\u2019s instincts and Alex\u2019s insight are too well-honed to settle for easy answers, even given the dark secrets in this troubled man\u2019s past. Their investigation unearths disturbing layers\u2013about victims, potential victims, and suspects alike\u2013plunging even deeper into the murky marsh\u2019s enigmatic depths.Bizarre details of the crimes suggest a devilish serial killer prowling L.A.\u2019s gritty streets. But when a new murder deviates from the pattern, derailing a possible profile, Alex and Milo must look beyond the suspicion of madness and consider an even more sinister mind at work. Answers don\u2019t come easy, but the darkest of drives and desires may fuel the most devious of foes.Bones is classic Kellerman\u2013relentlessly peeling back the skin and psyches of its characters and revealing the shadows and sins of the souls beneath. With jolt after jolt of galvanizing suspense, it drives the reader through its twists and turns toward a climax as satisfying as it is shattering.",

        "Description": "What if your best friend, whom you've always counted on to flounder in life and love (making your own modest accomplishments look not so bad), suddenly starts to surpass you in every way?  Wendy's best friend, Daphne, has always been dependably prone to catastrophe.  And Wendy has always been there to help.  If Daphne veers from suicidal to madly in love, Wendy offers encouragement.  But when Daphne is suddenly engaged, pregnant, and decorating a fabulous town house in no time at all, Wendy is...not so happy for her.  Caught between wanting to be the best friend she prides herself on being and crippling jealousy of flighty Daphne, Wendy takes things to the extreme, waging a full-scale attack on her best friend-all the while wearing her best, I'm-so-happy-for-you smile-and ends up in way over her head.  Rosenfeld has a knack for exposing the not-always-pretty side of being best friends--in writing that is glittering and diamond-sharp. I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU is a smart, darkly humorous, and uncannily dead-on novel about female friendship.",

        "Authors": "By Spotts, Frederic",
        "Description": "Germany's cultural glory - Germany's political shame: the opera festival established by Richard Wagner in 1876 is one of the most intriguing phenomena of modern European cultural history. The oldest and best known of music festivals, Bayreuth was from the beginning not simply a place for model performances of Wagner's works but equally the centre of an ideological cult, with the Festspielhaus its sacred shrine and audiences its devout pilgrims.This book is the first to provide a frank and comprehensive account of the institutions's history and functioning. The core of the study is a critical analysis of the performances and productions, brought alive with illustrations of stage settings, conductors and singers in costume. Around this artistic history is woven the remarkable story of why Wagner established the Festival and how his controversial descendants have managed it after him. At the same time the book traces Bayreuth's connection with the political fate of the German nation. It explains why the Festival became enmeshed in nationalism, racism and fascism until it was ultimately debased into what Thomas Mann labelled 'Hitler's court theatre'. The work concludes with a discussion of the postwar revolutionary productions of Wagner's operas that eventually liberated Bayreuth from its disgraceful political associations and that have made it the most exciting of operatic institutions.Exploring the links among Wagner's art, the Festival, the personalities of the Wagner dynasty and Germany's ideological development, this provocative study provides compelling reading not only for Wagner enthusiasts but also for anyone interested in European intellectual history since the mid-nineteenth century.",

As a boy he studied drawing at the most prestigious art institute in the world.  As a young man he left his home in Paris to volunteer in the army of the American colonies, where he served under George Washington. There he would also meet many of the people who would have a profound impact on his life, including Alexander Hamilton and James Monroe. And it was Washington himself who, in 1791, entrusted L\u2019Enfant with the planning of the nation\u2019s capital--and reluctantly allowed him to be dismissed from the project eleven months later. The plan for the city was published under another name, and for the remainder of his life L\u2019Enfant fought for recognition of his achievement.  But he would not live to see that day, and a century would pass before L\u2019Enfant would be given credit for his brilliant design.Scott W. Berg recounts this tale, richly evocative of time and place, with the narrative verve of a novel and with a cast of characters that ranges from Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers to the surveyor who took credit for L\u2019Enfant\u2019s plans, the assistant who spent a week in jail for his loyalty to L\u2019Enfant, and the men who finally restored L\u2019Enfant\u2019s reputation at the beginning of the twentienth century.Here is a fascinating, little-explored episode in American history: the story of a visionary artist and of the founding of the magnificent city that is his enduring legacy.",

        "Description": "Can you remember what happens at the end of 1984? Or what triggered Quentin Compson's suicide in The Sound and the Fury? Perhaps you need to know who won the National Book Award in 1960, how many times the Booker Prize has been awarded to non-British writers, or what novels people were reading the year the Titanic sank. The answers to all these questions, and many more, can now be found in A Reader's Guide to the Twentieth-Century Novel. Wide-ranging and authoritative, A Reader's Guide to the Twentieth-Century Novel is a unique and invaluable guide to modern fiction written in English. Arranged chronologically from Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim to E. Annie Proulx's The Shipping News, it contains detailed accounts of some 750 novels from the United States, Britain, Ireland, Canada, Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand, and the Caribbean. All of the century's major novelists are represented, alongside less-celebrated writers whose work has been unjustly neglected; such beloved children's authors as A.A. Milne, Frances Hodgson Burnett, and Kenneth Grahame, and such popular authors as Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming, Daphne Du Maurier, and others whose work has left a definite stamp on readers' imaginations. Each lively entry supplies a summary of the plot, places the novel in a biographical and historical context, and provides a provocative critical assessment. Written by a team of thirty-eight contributors made up of critics, biographers, novelists, historians, academics, and literary journalists, all entries are fully cross-referenced and supplemented at the end of the book by brief biographical notes on all authors and by helpful alphabetical indexes of novels and authors. Interwoven with the entries are also 150 short extracts illustrating the voice and style of many featured novels, from Rudyard Kipling's Kim to Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha. The chronological arrangement of the Guide gives readers fascinating insight into the sorts of books people were reading at any given period, and each year is prefaced by a selection of contemporary events from the worlds of the arts, science, and politics, revealing the background against which novels were written and published. This arrangement also allows readers to trace the literary history of twentieth-century fiction and to follow the development of individual authors. A celebration of modern fiction and an indispensable aide-memoire, A Reader's Guide to the Twentieth-Century Novel is a book to be read for pleasure as well as consulted for reference.",
