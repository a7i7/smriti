First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of his lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.Hailed as the first great English novel, Robinson Crusoe spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original. All readers with a taste for adventure will relish this inexpensive edition of one of the most popular and influential books ever written.",

In The Last Shot, author Darcy Frey chronicles the hopes and aspirations of four of Lincoln High's most promising players. What Frey finds is an environment that, by stressing the game above all else, has left its young athletes with nowhere to turn but to the glamorous coaches, slick recruiters, and million-dollar athletic companies who offer everything but guarantee nothing.  Gracefully and compassionately written, The Last Shot is a startling and disillusioning expos\u00e9 of inner-city life and the big business of college basketball.",

Mother of Pearl revolves around twenty-eight-year-old Even Grade, a black man who grew up an orphan, and Valuable Korner, the fifteen-year-old white daughter of the town whore and an unknown father. Both are passionately determined to discover the precious things neither experienced as children: human connection, enduring commitment, and, above all, unconditional love. A startlingly accomplished mixture of beauty, mystery, and tragedy, Mother of Pearl marks the debut of an extraordinary literary talent.",

        "Description": "Microwave ovens are in over 90% of American homes--but too often relegated to the role of re-heater, defroster, and popcorn maker. No more. Victoria Wise and Susanna Hoffman, authors of The Well-Filled Tortilla, spent three years exploring the possibilities of the microwave, and they've created a collection of 350 innovative, flavorful, at times whimsical recipes that take full advantage of the box and what it does best. And what the microwave does best, as the authors have discovered, is pretty terrific. Perfectly cooked fish. Creamy no-stir risottos. Luscious sauces for pasta. Crunchy pickles and relishes in a twinkling. Soup with an unexpected depth of flavor. Hasty puddings. And all without much of the time, mess, fuss, and demanding attention of conventional cooking. Then, marry these virtues with the sensibilities of two truly imaginative chefs, and the box really does become magic: Cuba Seafood Soup with Black Beans, Sweet Potato and Yam, Burmese Curried Chicken, Fish Fillets Brazilian, Tahini Spice Cake with Orange Glaze, Double Chocolate Pudding.",

From extraordinary marlin quests to hair-raising tales of \"fish catches man,\" here are fishing's 80 most unpredictable and spectacular tales. To get them, Shaun Morey-a fanatical fisherman and inveterate story collector-traveled from Alaska to Australia, Mexico, and the Caribbean to interview anglers, boat captains, guides and witnesses; to dig up photographs, and to confirm each tale. You'll read about Captain Jimmy Lewis who, in a moment of sheer bravado (or insanity), speared by hand-and landed-a 1,600-pound hammerhead shark. Or Bob Smith, fulfilling his twenty-year quest to catch all forty species of North America's wild trout on the bitter cold morning after his eighty-first birthday. Or the 800-pound blue marlin that made a final lunge-ripping up the deck and dragging a chair, with Paul Clause strapped in it, to the bottom of the ocean. (Paul survived; so did the marlin.)
