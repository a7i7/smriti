        "Authors": "By Shah, Saira",
        "Description": "The vivid, often startling memoir of a young woman shaped by two dramatically disparate worlds. Saira Shah is the English-born daughter of an Afghan aristocrat, inspired by his dazzling stories to rediscover the now lost life their forebears presided over for nine hundred years within sight of the minarets and lush gardens of Kabul and the snow-topped mountains of the Hindu Kush. Part sophisticated, sensitive Western liberal, part fearless, passionate Afghan, falling in love with her ancestral myth\u2013chasing Afghanistan\u2013Shah becomes, at twenty-one, a correspondent at the front of the war between the Soviets and the Afghan resistance. Then, imprisoning herself in a burqa, she risks her life to film Beneath the Veil, her acclaimed record of the devastation of women\u2019s lives by the Taliban. Discovering her extended family, discovering a world of intense family ritual, of community, of male primacy, of arranged marriages, and finding at last the now war-ravaged family seat, she discovers as well what she wants and what she rejects of her extraordinary heritage.",

        "Description": "An ivy league murder, a mysterious coded manuscript, and the secrets of a Renaissance prince collide memorably in The Rule of Four\u2014a brilliant work of fiction that weaves together suspense and scholarship, high art and unimaginable treachery.It's Easter at Princeton.  Seniors are scrambling to finish their theses.  And two students, Tom Sullivan and Paul Harris, are a hair's breadth from solving the mysteries of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\u2014a renowned text attributed to an Italian nobleman, a work that has baffled scholars since its publication in 1499. For Tom, their research has been a link to his family's past\u2014and an obstacle to the woman he loves. For Paul, it has become an obsession, the very reason for living.  But as their deadline looms, research has stalled\u2014until a long-lost diary surfaces with a vital clue.  And when a fellow researcher is murdered just hours later, Tom and Paul realize that they are not the first to glimpse the Hypnerotomachia 's  secrets. Suddenly the stakes are raised, and as the two friends sift through the codes and riddles at the heart of the text, they are beginnning to see the manuscript in a new light\u2014not simply as a story of faith, eroticism and pedantry, but as a bizarre, coded mathematical maze. And as they come closer and closer to deciphering the final puzzle of a book that has shattered careers, friendships and families, they know that their own lives are in mortal danger.  Because at least one person has been killed for knowing too much.  And they know even more.From the streets of fifteenth-century Rome to the rarified realm of the Ivy League, from a shocking 500 year-old murder scene to the drama of a young man's coming of age, The Rule of Four takes us on an entertaining, illuminating tour of history\u2014as it builds to a pinnacle of nearly unbearable suspense.",

        "Authors": "By Peters, Anne L., M.D. and Harmel, Mark (PHT)",
        "Description": "The definitive guide to identifying and treating diabetes and prediabetes by a world-renowned pioneer in diabetes treatment and management.  Diabetes has struck Americans in epidemic proportions, and its complications-which are entirely preventable-can be devastating. As a result, the majority of the 60 million Americans afflicted with prediabetes or diabetes are confused, frightened, and are often receiving sub-par treatment from well-intentioned doctors who simply don't have the experience with the disease to give patients the care they desperately need. This book, written by a world-renowned pioneer in diabetes treatment who has already written the textbook on the topic for physicians, is a cutting-edge, comprehensive program to reverse prediabetes and to treat both types of diabetes, including: what foods to eat/avoid, which medications help/hurt, and how to get the best treatment from your doctor.  As one of the top twenty physicians treating diabetes in America, director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Programs, and the physician currently in charge of developing the nation's largest outreach program for community-based diabetes prevention and treatment, Dr. Anne Peters treats a spectrum of patients, from Hollywood producers, writers, and stars who frequent her clinic in Beverly Hills to the poor who populate her free clinic in East L.A.  Authoritative and reassuring, Dr. Peters' Prescription will arm readers and their physicians with the latest findings on the diabetes epidemic, helping them to confront the disease effectively and exponentially increase their quality of life.",

        "Authors": "By Macneill, Jim, Winsemius, Pieter, and Yakushiji, Taizo",
        "Description": "Over the last year, the world has seen some cataclysmic changes. Eastern Europe is no longer yoked with Soviet communism, Germany is again a single, powerful nation, and Russia itself is pursuing a free-market economy at an almost frantic pace. Yet as we focus on the triumph of democracy, it is easy to overlook the potentially catastrophic changes that face the world environment, changes that are inextricably linked to the workings of the political and economic institutions of our time.Beyond Interdependence builds upon the Brundtland Commission's landmark reportOur Common Future, a book that has been hailed as \"the most important document of the decade on the future of the world\" and has sold over one-half million copies in nineteen foreign languages. Dr. Jim MacNeill, the principal author of both works, has in this latest study extended the Commission's analysis of the critical relationships between the global environment, the world economy, and the international order. Together with his eminent colleagues, Pieter Winsemius and Taizo Yakushiji, MacNeill shows that while our global economy and ecology have become completely interlocked, they have remained separate in our institutions, and in the minds of our policymakers. The result is a wide range of domestic and international policies that are accelerating the depletion of Earth's basic ecological (and economic) capital--its rivers, lakes, and oceans, its soils and forests, its flora and fauna, and its ozone shield. These short-sighted policies also threaten us in the next century with a greater rise in global warming and sea level than have occurred in the ten-thousand years since the last ice age. The authors argue that this environmental degradation and resource depletion will be the principal source of interstate conflict in the post-cold war world.Providing a fresh analysis of the issues of global change, and taking into account such recent events as the tidal-shift in East/West relations and the G7 Economic Summit in Houston,Beyond Interdependence shows how industrialized nations can take unilateral action to address environmental threats while improving macroeconomic efficiency and international competitiveness. It also demonstrates how developed nations can negotiate a series of mutually advantageous \"bargains\" with Eastern European and Third World nations.With its incisive analysis and far-reaching recommendations for policy reform, Beyond Interdependence shows us how we can act urgently but intelligently to advance our common future.",

They work the phones, shout the morning line, sacrifice their personal lives, and push themselves to the physical limit to meet their quotas. They are soldiers of an economic superpower, ragtag troops staking the front line of American corporate influence.The reluctant hero of Bombardiers is Sidney Geeder, King of Mortgages, who dreams of cashing in his lucrative company stock and quitting his job. The only one who can replace him is Eggs Igino, a rebellious boy wonder who refuses to be seduced by the money or intimidated by management threats. When Eggs Igino mysteriously disappears, Sid is caught in the ensuing havoc and eventually is forced to choose between his promised pay-out and his long-anticipated freedom.Sid and Eggs are joined in the trenches by an unforgettable group of salespeople: Lisa Lisa, a woman tough enough to call Alan Greenspan a peckerhead but incapable of keeping a lover; Nickel Sansome, a bald company man who couldn't sell mittens in a snowstorm; and Coyote Jack, the sales manager so overwhelmed by corporate ambition that he forces his traders to sell more bonds than they can handle.As the deals swirl, faster and riskier and bigger, the transactions become increasingly bizarre: shifting around the debt of failed savings and loans, financing investment in bankrupt Eastern European nations, and, finally, arranging a corporate takeover of certain assets in the Dominican Republic (in this case, the entire country).Set at the nexus of pure capitalism, the Information Economy, and high technology, Bombardiers will change the way you think about modern business.",

        "Authors": "By Brazile, Donna",
        "Description": "Cooking with Grease is an inspiring, behind-the-scenes memoir of the life and times of a tenacious political organizer and the first African-American woman to head a major presidential campaign.  Donna Brazile fought her first political fight at age nine -- campaigning (successfully) for a city council candidate who promised a playground in her neighborhood. The day after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, she committed her heart and her future to political and social activism. By the 2000 presidential election, Brazile had become a major player in American political history -- and she remains one of the most outspoken and forceful political activists of our day.  Brazile grew up one of nine children in a working-poor family in New Orleans, a place where talking politics comes as naturally as stirring a pot of seafood gumbo -- and where the two often go hand in hand. Growing up, she learned how to cook from watching her mother, Jean, stir the pots in their family kitchen. She inherited her love of reading and politics from her grandmother Frances. Her brothers Teddy Man and Chet worked as foot soldiers in her early business schemes and in her voter registration efforts as a child.  Cooking with Grease follows Donna's rise to greater and greater political and personal accomplishments. But each new career success came with its own kind of heartache, especially in her greatest challenge: leading Al Gore's 2000 campaign, making her the first African American to lead a major presidential campaign.  Cooking with Grease is an intimate account of Donna's thirty years in politics. Her witty style and innovative political strategies have garnered her the respect and admiration of colleagues and adversaries alike -- she is as comfortable trading quips with Karl Rove as she is with her Democratic colleagues. Her story is as warm and nourishing as a bowl of Brazile family gumbo.",

        "Title": "East of the Sun: The Epic Conquest and Tragic History of Siberia",
        "Authors": "By Bobrick, Benson",
        "Description": "In sweep, color, and grandeur, the conquest and settlement of Siberia compares with the winning of the American West. It is the greatest pioneering story in human history, uniquely combining the heroic colonization of an intractable virgin land, the ghastly dangers and high adventure of Arctic exploration, and the grimmest saga of penal servitude in the chronicles of man. Four hundred years of continual human striving chart its course, a drama of unremitting extremes and elemental confrontations, pitting man against nature, and man against man. East of the Sun, a work of panoramic scope and brilliance, is the first complete account of this strange and terrible story.To most Westerners, Siberia is a vast and mysterious place. The richest resource area on the face of the earth, its land mass covers 5 million square miles - 7 1/2 percent of the total land surface of the globe. From the first foray in 1581 across the Ural Mountains by a band of Cossack outlaws to the fall of Gorbachev, East of the Sun is history on a grand scale. With vivid immediacy, Bobrick describes the often brutal subjugation of Siberia's aboriginal tribes and the cultures that were destroyed; the great eighteenth-century explorations that defined Siberia's borders and Russia's attempt to \"extend\" Siberia further with settlements in Alaska, California, and Hawaii; and the transformation of Siberia into a penal colony for criminal and political exiles, an experiment more terrible than Australia's Botany Bay. There is the building of the stupendous Trans-Siberian Railway across seven time zones; Siberia's key role in the bloody aftermath of the October Revolution in 1917; and Stalin's dreaded Gulag, which corrupted its very soil.Today, Siberia is the hope of Russia's future, now that all her appended republic have broken away. Its story has never been more timely.",

Now, in this generously illustrated chronicle of our  age-old fascination with the sea, he interweaves his experiences  at the heart of modern undersea exploration with a vivid account  of thousands of years of seafaring and discovery, as his own most  exciting and important dives become the starting points for an  odyssey through time that introduces the greatest sailors and  voyages of history and sketches the evolution of ships and  navigation from the first reed boats to the nuclear submarines of  today.",

        "Description": "Millions of readers have been swept away by W. E. B. Griffin's novels of the Marine Corps, a series that has only grown stronger and more popular with each volume. And now Close Combat - Volume VI - brings the saga of The Corps during World War II into ever more dramatic arenas.As the Japanese forces close in for an all-out effort to recapture Guadalcanal from the American forces occupying the island, many fates converge and intertwine. First Lieutenant William Dunn, twenty-one years old but already one of only two pilots remaining from his fighter squadron's original sixteen, must learn what it is like to lead men - and to lose them....Hot-tempered Sergeant Thomas McCoy finds he has a hero's welcome waiting stateside - if he can avoid a court-martial first....On a bloody island, Major Jake Dillon discovers just how much combat is involved in a combat correspondent's life....First Lieutenant R. B. Macklin, a consummate bully, is put on a War Bond tour so he will not endanger his own men....General Fleming Pickering, on a ticklish diplomatic mission, attempts to balance the hot and mighty temperaments of Douglas MacArthur, OSS chief Bill Donovan and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox....Corporal Robert Easterbrock, still wet behind the ears, discovers that the price of success in wartime may be uncomfortably high....From the Solomons to Australia to Washington, D.C., old faces and new - generals, captains, privates, wives and sweethearts - find themselves faced with the challenge of their lives.This is the story of the men of the Marine Corps, their loves and loyalties, of an elite fraternity united by courage and honor. Filled with crackling realism and adventure, rich characters, real heroes, and that special flair for the military heart and mind that make Griffin's novels so loved, Close Combat is a dramatic, captivating novel, further proof, in the words of Tom Clancy, that \"W. E. B. Griffin is a storyteller in the grand tradition.\"",

        "Authors": "By Keegan, John",
        "Description": "In fiction, the spy is a glamorous figure whose secrets make or break peace, but, historically, has intelligence really been a vital step to military victories? In this breakthrough study, the preeminent war historian John Keegan goes to the heart of a series of important conflicts to develop a powerful argument about military intelligence. In his characteristically wry and perceptive prose, Keegan offers us nothing short of a new history of war through the prism of intelligence. He brings to life the split-second decisions that went into waging war before the benefit of aerial surveillance and electronic communications. The English admiral Horatio Nelson was hot on the heels of Napoleon\u2019s fleet in the Mediterranean and never knew it, while Stonewall Jackson was able to compensate for the Confederacy\u2019s disadvantage in firearms and manpower with detailed maps of the Appalachians. In the past century, espionage and decryption have changed the face of battle: the Japanese surprise attack at the Battle of the Midway was thwarted by an early warning. Timely information, however, is only the beginning of the surprising and disturbing aspects of decisions that are made in war, where brute force is often more critical.Intelligence in War is a thought-provoking work that ranks among John Keegan\u2019s finest achievements.",

        "Authors": "By Griffin, Peter",
        "Description": "Peter Griffin has drawn upon a wealth of previously unpublished material--including numerous letters and five of Hemingway's early short stories that appear here in their entirety--to trace the formative years of one of America's Most celebrated and influential authors.     This book examines in richer detail than any previous biography Hemingway's midwestern childhood, his relations with his parents, his journalistic apprenticeship, and his experiences as a Red Cross volumteer during World War I.  It sheds new light on his wartime romance with Agnes Kurowsky, his first love, and the circumstances surrounding his wounding and convalescence.  It closes with Hemingway at the brink of the literary career that would bring him worldwide acclaim.  As the brisk narrative moves from Illinois to Kansa City on to New York and then Europe, Griffin paints a vivid picture of the people, places and events that shaped Hemingway as a man and a writer.  This is the first installment of what promises to become the difinitive Hemingway biography for this generation.  In a foreword to the book, Jack Hemingway, Ernest's first son, writes that Griffin's \"insights and his innate skills have enabled him to bring a far different view of Hemingway as a developing human being.\"  This book, he says, \"has shown me insights into my own father's character and behavior I would not have thought possible in view of the time lapse between Hemingway's death and the research Griffin accomplished.\"",

        "Title": "The Good Fight: Why Liberals---and Only Liberals---Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again",
        "Authors": "By Beinart, Peter",
        "Description": "Once upon a time, liberals knew what they believed. They believed America must lead the world by persuasion, not command. And they believed that by championing freedom overseas, America itself could become more free. That liberal spirit won America's trust at the dawn of the cold war. Then it collapsed in the wake of Vietnam. Now, after 9/11, and the failed presidency of George W. Bush, America needs it back.In this powerful and provocative book, Peter Beinart offers a new liberal vision, based on principles liberals too often forget: That America's greatness cannot simply be asserted; it must be proved. That to be good, America does not have to be pure. That American leadership is not American empire. And that liberalism cannot merely define itself against the right, but must fervently oppose the totalitarianism that blighted Europe a half century ago, and which stalks the Islamic world today.With liberals severed from their own history, conservatives have drawn on theirs\u2014the principles of national chauvinism and moral complacency that America once rejected. The country will reject them again, and embrace the creed that brought it greatness before. But only if liberals remember what that means. It means an unyielding hostility to totalitarianism\u2014and a recognition that defeating it requires bringing hope to the bleakest corners of the globe. And it means understanding that democracy begins at home, in a nation that does not merely preach about justice, but becomes more just itself. Peter Beinart's The Good Fight is a passionate rejoinder to the conservatives who have ruled Washington since 9/11. It is an intellectual lifeline for a Democratic Party lying flat on its back. And it is a call for liberals to revive the spirit that swept America, and inspired the world.",

Jacob may be homeless and mentally ill, but Doug can't imagine that this meek and intensely religious man could have killed and dismembered a woman. Yet Bernard Cashman, a forensic expert at the Oregon State Crime Lab, finds evidence that indisputably connects Cohen with the crime.Frustrated and confused, Doug consults Amanda Jaffe, star of Margolin's spine-tingler Wild Justice. Amanda and her father, Frank, are working on a case that seems completely unrelated\u2014gangster Art Prochaska is accused of murdering an informer. When Amanda starts looking too closely at the seemingly air-tight evidence in these two apparently unconnected cases, people start to die\u2014and she discovers that a madman with the power to alter the truth is on the loose.From the author whose writing the Chicago Tribune called \"twisted and brilliant\" and hailed by Lisa Scottoline as \"genuinely surprising,\" Proof Positive promises an unbeatable combination of inside-CSI detail and intriguing insights into the minds of criminals and the attorneys who defend them\u2014and, of course, the plot twists, stay-up-all-night suspense, and gasp-inducing surprises that are Phillip Margolin's undisputed trademark.",

        "Authors": "By Schefter, Adam, Towle, Philip, and Romanowski, Bill",
        "Description": "Off the field, Bill Romanowski was a caring father and devoted husband.On the field, Romo was unstoppable, terrorizing the NFL for sixteen brutal years.Some players called him a throwback, some called him mean, some called him dirty. But they all respected him and would much rather have played with him than against him. Coaches loved Romo for the heart and soul he gave to the game. He was rewarded with two Pro Bowl appearances and four Super Bowl rings, but it all came at a heavy price: dozens of concussions that have led to dizzy spells, memory lapses . . . and questionable choices that undermined his integrity. Would he do it all over again? Romo the intimidating linebacker would in a heartbeat. Bill Romanowski, however, would do things differently today.Whether it was in high school, at Boston College, or with the NFL, Romo vowed to himself that he would outwork and outhustle everyone else. Practice? Loved it; he'd play like it was a game and attack his teammates as if they were opponents. Game day? He'd work himself into a state of invincibility. If you were a tight end, running back, or quarterback with the wrong uniform, you were marked for elimination. Nutrition? He would consult top nutritionists, looking for the best foods, an extraordinary range of supplements, and alternative remedies, anything that would help give him an edge. It would lead to a controversial relationship with BALCO.Treatment? He would try almost anything that would help with his performance, keep his body healthy, and help it recover from the beatings he took and gave on Sundays. Phentermine, THG, hyperbaric chambers, IVs. He would experiment with substances and methods that the NFL had never heard of, and he'd become an expert who teammates and friends would turn to. Endurance? He never missed a game to injury, and once played an entire season with a partially torn knee ligament. Intimidation? From trash talk to mind games to nasty hits and breaking fingers, Romo would roam the field seeking confrontation -- and usually find it.Through it all -- through his years with the San Francisco 49ers, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Denver Broncos, and the Oakland Raiders -- Romo was driven by something else: the fear of failure, the fear of losing it all. Who knew what a head coach or an owner would be thinking or what young player was in the wings ready to take his hard-won position. He didn't dare allow someone else to decide his fate, so he did whatever it took to live his dreams and ward off the dragons of self-doubt that pushed him . . . until his body betrayed him and his morality was compromised.Romo is a jolting, candid, and inspiring rocket ride into the heart of the NFL and a look at what it costs to be an elite athlete today in a world of impossible expectations.  Read it -- and try not to wince.",

        "Title": "Rage and Fire: A Life of Louise Colet : Pioneer Feminist, Literary Star, Flaubert's Muse",
        "Authors": "By Gray, Francine du Plessix",
        "Description": "In this ground-breaking biography of a heroic feminist and literary figure, novelist and essayist Francine du Plessix Gray brilliantly resurrects one of the most fascinating women of the nineteenth century.To English-language readers, the flamboyant and beautiful Louise Colet (1810-1876) is best known as Gustave Flaubert's great love; as a central model for Emma Bovary; and as the recipient of Flaubert's most treasured letters, a voluminous six-year correspondence that offers his most eloquent statements on literature and an invaluable chronicle of Madame Bovary's composition.What is less known about Louise Colet is that at the apogee of her career she was, along with George Sand, one of the most famous women writers in France, a prolific author equally fluent in poetry, fiction, historical essays, and journalism. Known as \"the Muse,\" Colet presided over a renowned salon of mid-nineteenth-century Paris. At age twenty-nine she won the poetry prize of the Academie Francaise, and she went on to receive the prize three more times in the next fourteen years, more often than any other woman in French history. The confidante of Madame Recamier, Victor Hugo, and Leconte de Lisle and a lover of Alfred de Vigny and Alfred de Musset, this self-supporting single mother refused to share her home with a man lest it compromise the principle of liberty she lived by. In her work, Louise Colet was one of the first nineteenth-century authors to explore the historical causes of female alienation; in her private life, she pioneered a new model of womanhood in an age when the only sanctioned options for women were \"housewife or whore.\"Drawing from Colet's recently discovered journals, which, like Flaubert's letters, can be startlingly erotic, Gray vividly brings to life this formidable woman's world and unmasks the astonishing sexual and social mores of nineteenth-century France. Written in a novelistic, richly detailed style but researched with meticulous scholarship, this biography portrays the complexities of a woman who ascended to fame and literary respectability through her talent and a willful spirit that refused to acknowledge the word \"no.\"",

In the wake of 9\u201311, the activities of Osama Bin Laden and Hamas, and the most recent Gulf War, the western press has been filled with information and mis\u2013information about the true nature of Islam. Is it a feudal misogynist belief system that is a threat to Western values? Is it an ideology of oppression? Or, is it a religion that is as varied as Christianity; a \"big tent\" that includes not only bomb\u2013throwing ideologues, but also those committed to an authentic spirituality that embraces many of the values shared by the mainstream in Europe and America? Why I am a Muslim is an attempt to grapple with these issues. Part memoir, part polemic, it represents the side of Islam that is left out of the daily newspapers. For Hasan, being a Muslim is not merely a matter of birth, but it is a matter of choice. In seven chapters, she presents seven reasons why she is committed to Islam and why it is a viable spiritual option for anyone. 1. Because I was born Muslim. 2. Because Islam gives me a direct relationship with God. 3. Because Islam has a rich mystical tradition in Sufism. 4. Because Islam allows and expects me to make mistakes. 5. Because Islam is ethnically diverse. 6. Because Islam is a woman&#39;s religion. 7. Because being Muslim makes me a better American (and being American makes me a better Muslim).",

Yet until now, Belichick has deliberately stayed as far from the spotlight as possible, proving himself as elusive as he is talented.In The Education of a Coach, writer-historian David Halberstam paints a portrait of a man and his profession, revealing both the intimate world of Bill Belichick and the unique abilities that make him so successful: His exceptional intelligence, his ability to break down and exploit game film, his singular discipline, and his almost unmatched work ethic. Working with an unusual degree of cooperation from Belichick, Halberstam shows us a man acutely aware of all the forces in contemporary sports that work against the old-fashioned concept of team, who has somehow managed to change his players' view of how the game should be played. The result is a book not just about Bill Belichick, but about what it means to be a leader.",

He paints a stark picture of racial inequality in America -- focusing on family life, education, income, and employment -- and explores the current controversies over politics, crime, and the causes of the gap between the races. Illuminating and oftentimes startling,Two Nations demonstrates how race has defined America's history and will continue to shape its future.",

Laurie finds grown-up life just as harrowing as her reckless youth, as she meets Mr. Right, moves in, settles down, and crosses the toe-stubbing threshold of matrimony. From her mother's grade-school warning to avoid kids in tie-dyed shirts because their hippie parents spent their food money on drugs and art supplies; to her night-before-the-wedding panic over whether her religion is the one where you step on the glass; to her unfortunate overpreparation for the mandatory drug-screening urine test at work; to her audition as a Playboy centerfold as research for a newspaper story, Autobiography of a Fat Bride has the same zits-and-all candor and outrageous humor that made Idiot Girls an instant cult phenomenon. In Autobiography of a Fat Bride, Laurie contemplates family, home improvement, and the horrible tyrannies of cosmetic saleswomen. She finds that life doesn't necessarily get any easier as you get older. But it does get funnier.",

        "Description": "From the bestselling author of Witness to Hope comes an inside account of the election of Pope Benedict XVI and an unflinching view of the Catholic Church at the dawn of a new era.  After 25 years of John Paul II\u2032s guidance, the Catholic Church is entering a new age, with its bedrock traditions intact but pressing questions of its vitality to address in a rapidly changing world. Beginning with a portrait of John Paul\u2032s last months, God\u2032s Choice will then offer an account of the complex conclave process that produced Benedict XVI as the next pope. Drawing on Weigel\u2032s unprecedented access during the post-John Paul II intrerregnum, readers will be offered an inside view of the issues and personalities that shaped the conclave\u2032s deliberations. Weigel will also survey the current state of the Church around the world: the remarkable vitality of Catholicism in Africa; the new center of the world\u2032s Catholic population -- Latin America; the collapse of Catholic faith and practice in much of western Europe, contrasted with its strength in Poland and other parts of the post-communist world; the continuing struggles of Catholicism in Asia; the vibrancy of some aspects of Catholic life in the United States, even as the Church in America struggles to overcome its recent experience of scandal. God\u2032s Choice will paint a personal portrait of the new pope and analyze the crucial issues facing world Catholicism in the first decades of the 21st century. It will be a major reference point for anyone seeking to understand the Catholic future, and the larger human future the Church will help to shape.",

Told in alternating voices of Vivi and the Petite Ya-Yas, Siddalee and Baylor Walker, as well as other denizens of Thornton, Louisiana, YA-YAS IN BLOOM show us the Ya-Yas in love and at war with convention.  Through crises of faith and hilarious lapses of parenting skills, brushes with alcoholism and glimpses of the dark reality of racial bigotry, the Ya-Ya values of unconditional loyalty, high style, and Cajun sass shine through.  Necies wise credo, \"Just think pretty pink and blue thoughts,\" helps too...But in the Ya-Yas' inimitable way, these four remarkable women also teach their children about the Mysteries: the wonder of snow in the deep South, the possibility that humans are made of stars, and the belief that miracles do happen.  And they need a miracle when old grudges and wounded psyches lead to a heartbreaking crime...and the dynamic web of sisterhood is the only safety net strong enough to hold families together and endure.After two bestsellers and a blockbuster movie, the Ya-Yas have become part of American culture -- icons for the power of women's friendship. YA-YAS IN BLOOM continues the saga, giving us more Ya-Ya lore, spun out in the rich patois of the Louisiana bayou country and brim full of the Ya-Ya message to embrace life and each other with joy.",
