What if she then tells you that her body is actually in a coma on the other side of town? Should you have her see a psychiatrist or should you consult one yourself? Or do you take a chance and believe in her, and allow yourself to be swept up in an extraordinary adventure?  This is the beginning of the dilemma that Arthur, a young San Francisco architect, is faced with when he discovers Lauren in his apartment.  Arthur is the only man who can share Lauren's secret, the only one who can see her, hear her, and talk to her when no one else so much as senses her presence. So when doctors prepare to end Lauren's physical care -- which would destroy the magical bond she and Arthur cherish -- he must find a way to save her. For, after all, it is only her love that can save him.  If Only It Were True is a heartwarming love story impossible to forget, an adventure that is by turns breathtaking and hilarious -- a captivating tale that evokes the essence of romance and our boundless capacity to believe.",

        "Title": "The Thanksgiving Ceremony: New Traditions for America's Family Feast",
        "Authors": "By Bleier, Edward and Safire, William (FRW)",
        "Description": "When we think about Thanksgiving we contemplate history, the autumn harvest, and, of course, eating turkey and watching football. But most of all, we think about family, friends, and the bounty of our country. Edward Bleier\u2019s The Thanksgiving Ceremony introduces a brand-new tradition for the Thanksgiving table, offering a wonderful way for all Americans to give thanks and rejoice in the sense of togetherness and community this special holiday brings.The heart of the book is a participatory ceremony designed to be read aloud around the table. It recounts the story of the early settlers and the challenges they, and all subsequent immigrant generations, faced. The ceremony provides roles for guests of all ages and takes about twenty minutes. There is also a brief history of Thanksgiving, as well as a wide array of poems, hymns, songs, prayers, and readings that enable families to create and customize their own ceremony, including pieces by Maya Angelou, Irving Berlin, Woodie Guthrie, and Emily Dickinson. As William Safire writes in his foreword, \u201cGetting together for a grand dinner party may be glorious fun, but a holiday should have a focus\u201d\u2014one that reminds us why we celebrate it. This long-overdue book offers that focus in a short, elegant format that any gathering of family and friends can participate in, and enjoy, for many years to come.Praise for The Thanksgiving Ceremony: \"The Thanksgiving Ceremony is a small gem\u2014a book that brings to life the history, songs, and traditions, old and new, of the most widely celebrated holiday of the year.  This is a buoyant book, full of hope and praise of all that makes us Americans.\"\u2014Julie Nixon Eisenhower\"There are times, like these, when it's important to count our blessings. Ed Bleier's delightful book lets us do the math.\"\u2014Alan Alda and Arlene Alda\"This great country has provided the 'music' and this book provides the eloquent 'lyrics' for the Thanksgiving tables of all Americans, regardless of race or religion. It's a joyous tribute to who we are, and can be, as Americans.\"\u2014Quincy Jones\"Over the years, I've had so many Thanksgiving dinners with Ed and Magda that when Ed Bleier talks turkey, all of us listen.\"\u2014Steven Spielberg\"The Thanksgiving Ceremony is a wonderful and moving idea. It is central to what we celebrate and a happy reminder of why America's principles endure as they do.\"\u2014Peter Jennings and Kayce Freed",

        "Authors": "By Madden, Chris Casson, Hill, Nancy E., and Schultz, Carolyn",
        "Description": "Usually the first room to greet guests, the living room is not only the most public area of any home, but also its most multifunctional. This essential room fills a variety of roles\u2014from entertainment center to study area, children\u2019s play zone to library, not to mention serving as the family\u2019s gathering space, complete with couch and coffee table. Now Chris Casson Madden, nationally renowned design expert and author of Bedrooms, Getaways, and A Room of Her Own, imparts a wealth of decorating expertise in her new book, Chris Casson Madden\u2019s New American Living Rooms. Showcasing a dazzling array of some of the most beautiful rooms across the country, Madden proves that living rooms can be at once practical, inviting, and inspiring. Living rooms often present unique design challenges: they can range from great rooms with fifteen-foot-high ceilings that stretch across half the house to small spaces that relate awkwardly to the rest of the home. In addition, the multifunctional character of these areas makes them all the more complex. Yet Madden highlights a myriad of design solutions that can make decorating this room painless, even pleasurable. She offers options and ideas to suit many tastes\u2014whether you favor sleek, modern styling or old-world elegance, Asian-inspired elements or classical influences.With homes from California to Connecticut, New Mexico to Maine, the book features nearly two dozen extraordinary living rooms. For large, open spaces, Madden offers creative ways to integrate all the activities of a living room, dining room, family room, library, bar, and study. She examines spaces that open onto gardens, pools, kitchens, or play areas and others that are centered around musical instruments, entertainment units, art, or books. She offers terrific ideas for handling storage and equipment problems and shows how the same room can be used for quiet time, family time, and entertaining.Ultimately, Madden presents living rooms that are gorgeous, at times even luxurious, while remaining comfortable, nurturing, and appropriate for the families who use them\u2014a difficult balance to strike, but it\u2019s what makes Chris Casson Madden\u2019s New American Living Rooms the essential guide to decorating these rooms for real life.",

        "Authors": "By Barrett, Erin and Mingo, Jack",
        "Description": "Ben Franklin's Guide to Wealth is the modern version of the treatise The Way of Wealth by Richard Saunders, one of Ben Franklin's many pseudonyms. Franklin practiced what he preached in the treatise, and it made him rich enough to have a full life, travel extensively, and follow his intellectual musings, which in turn led him to become an accomplished scientist, inventor, political activist, diplomat, and writer. Franklin wasn't born rich. He built his legacy using his intelligence, curiosity, natural good sense, and proclivity for thrift and hard work. When he died, he left a fortune. Barrett and Mingo bring practicing what Franklin preached up to date for today's busy lifestyles. It's time to get back to financial basics. It's time to think about what \"rich\" really means. It might mean not hiring someone to do lawn work, saving some money, and sharing time spent together as a family. It's time to look for guidance from America's original financial guru, Ben Franklin.Ben Franklin's Guide to Wealth shows readers how to apply Franklin's financial wisdom to their own lives. Quotes from the original treatise such as \"If you have something to do tomorrow, do it today\" and \"Leisure is time for doing something useful,\" are followed by the authors' downtoearth commentary. Barrett and Mingo--history and trivia buffs--offer their own sage advice on a range of financial basics, including debt, thrift, the value of work and business, developing financial responsibility, money and time, and preparing for the future. As the authors attest in the Introduction, we should listen to the way of Ben Franklin because \"it works.\"  A clever, wise, and fun book, the financial advice in Ben Franklin's Guide to Wealth works as well today as it did 250 years ago.",

When he died in 1993, he left behind a collection of essays on fiction which he had been working on in the last of his life.Assembled by his son, Nicholas Howe, who also provides an introduction, these accessible, idiosyncratic essays, - which Irving Howe called his shtiklach (Yiddish for \"little pieces\" or \"morsels\") - explore such enduring literary concepts as character, style, tone, genre. Many address both literature and politics; but all originate from a passion, a moral striving, and an abiding faith in the common reader.",

Does he get a promotion? No, but an angry reprimand for neglecting \"official procedures.\" That's the way it is in today's FBI, where keeping America safe takes a back seat to brownnosing and backbiting - except for men like Special Agent Mike Devlin. A shrewd, tough veteran of Detroit's war zone, Devlin plays to win - and he plays by his own rules. Which is why he is now assigned to the FBI equivalent of Siberia - midnight wiretap duty.Yet when Devlin gets wind of a Mafia spy inside his Detroit bureau, he springs into action, secretly recruiting a \"dirty dozen\" squad of FBI renegades to discover the leak while also solving a monstrous kidnapping of a terrified young woman. A novel that only an FBI agent could have written, Witness to the Truth is searing, authentic, and stingingly funny. In its commentary on the Bureau's foibles, Witness to the Truth introduces the saltiest and most winning hero of the year, and a major new novelist, Paul Lindsay.",

Is he, perhaps, too good to be true? The tumultuous presidential bandwagon of Thomas Crane, a charismatic but elusive senator from the midwest, presents reporter Cliff O'Connell with a career-making opportunity that dissolves into a nightmare. In combing the past for the real Thomas Crane, O'Connell becomes the keeper of a chilling secret that he knows should remain buried forever. O'Connell's former lover, Robin Winters, now works for the Crane campaign, and that relationship reignites at the same time the campaign, against all odds, takes off. O'Connell also discovers an unexpected rapport with Crane himself, who shares his love of history and a humble, small-town background. Digging into the part of Thomas Crane's past that refuses to make sense, uncovering layers of truth with a growing sense of unease, O'Connell is caught in a brutal triangle, torn between personal and political passions and his commitment to the truth. His discovery and what he does about it have cataclysmic and unexpected results for himself, Robin, Crane, and a nation. If Men Were Angels is an urgent, resonant novel about love, hope, and loss. Rooted in the realities of a brawling campaign, but proceeding along the lines of an elegant and remorseless legal thriller, it is the novel about politics that Scott Turow might have written.",

What he doesn't know is whether being Special Ed. means you shouldn't go to the prom. But since no rule says you can't, Nick decides to ask Shana.  But the prom doesn't turn out at all the way Nick expects it to, and everything bad seems to get all mixed up together: the prom, what Shana does, and the terrible thing that happened to Nick's sister nine years ago. Nick doesn't want to think about any of it, but he begins to realize that unless he makes peace with all the memories that trouble him, they will haunt him forever....",

A freighter bound for Liverpool is boarded by Russian coast guards in the Black Sea. The celebrated London merchant venturer \"Tiger\" Single disappears into thin air.  In Single & Single the writer who both epitomizes and transcends the novel of espionage opens with a haunting set piece, then establishes a sequence of events whose connections are mysterious, complex and compelling. This is a story of corrupt liaisons between criminal elements in the new Russian states and the world of legitimate finance in the West. Le Carr\u00e9's finest novel in years, it is also an intimate portrait of two families: one Russian, the other English; one trading illicit goods, the other laundering the profits; one betrayed by a son-in-law, the other betrayed, and redeemed, by a son.  This is territory le Carr\u00e9 knows better than anyone. Masterful and prescient, he is writing at the height of his creative powers, and Oliver Single, the central protagonist, is one of his most fascinating characters.",

Previous analysts have placed their bets on the president's political prowess or personal character. Yet by the first standard, LBJ should have been our greatest president, and by the second the nod would go to Jimmy Carter. Greenstein surveys each president's record in public communication, political skill, vision, cognitive style, and emotional intelligence. He concludes that the last is by far the most important.",

        "Authors": "By Rueter, Theodore",
        "Description": "A hilarious bipartisan collection of rants, malapropisms, doublespeak, and just plain idiocy from lifelong politicians and Washington wannabes. Whether it's a Republican mayor on crime -- \"The streets are safe in Philadelphia. It's only the people who make them unsafe (Frank Rizzo) -- or his Democratic counterpart on the same subject -- \"Outside of the killings, Washington has one of the lowest crime rates in the country\" (Marion Barry) -- political discourse is often off-course, not to mention unintentionally hilarious.Wickedly funny when read from either direction, this book presents both Republican stupidity (\"Approximately 80 percent of our air pollution stems from vegetation\"-- Ronald Reagan) and matching head-slappers from Democrats (\"For those who died [in the San Francisco earthquake], their lives will never be the same again\" -- Barbara Boxer).The 267 Stupidest Things . . is the perfect antidote to election-year bombast.",

In The Watchmen John Altman delivers his most gripping thriller yet.  An Al Qaeda prisoner named Ali Zattout is moved from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to a CIA safe house for observation and interrogation. He is smart, cooperative, and thoroughly Westernized -but is he too good to be true? The man who must question him, Dr. Louis Finney, regrets his days spent working for the U.S. Government. Years have passed since he and his mentor performed experiments designed to develop multiple personalities in unsuspecting patients, but only recently have his guilty nightmares begun to subside. Now his mentor appears on Finney's doorstep, terminally ill, asking him to consult for a critically important CIA case.  But the CIA isn't the only group interested in Zattout's information. His capture has aroused concerns at the highest ranks of Al Qaeda. An assassin schooled in ancient arts of meditation and murder is sent to eliminate Zattout before he discloses their secrets. The CIA safe house is as heavily guarded as the secret of its location, but Zattout is not the only traitor within its walls. . . .",

For Alice, seeing her marvelous lost boy is a miracle she can\u2019t quite believe but is more than willing to embrace. In the weeks to come, Johnny will appear in the most unlikely places, visible only to the two people who need him most: his nine-year-old brother, locked in a silent world, whose special needs Johnny always seemed to understand\u2026and his mother, who has always nurtured her family, but who now needs a guardian angel of her own.Through a season of hope and healing, Johnny will walk by his mother\u2019s side, leaving miracles in his wake, leading his parents, his girlfriend, his sister, and his brother out of their grief. But as Alice is about to discover, Johnny has returned not just to help those he loves, but to uncover a purpose even he cannot comprehend--one that will change them all forever.An unforgettable story of loving and letting go, of mixed blessings and second chances,Johnny Angel is a celebration of life, hope, and forgiveness.

        "Title": "William Walton: Behind the Fa\u00e7ade",
        "Authors": "By Walton, Susana",
        "Description": "The acclaimed English composer William Walton--enfant terrible of English music in the 1920s and '30s, composer of Fa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdade, Belshazzar's Feast, and a host of other brilliant works--lived a long and accomplished life. Admitted as a nine-year-old Lancashire schoolboy to Christ Church Choir School in Oxford, he was discovered by Sacheverell Sitwell as an undergraduate at Christ Church, adopted by all three Sitwells, and early on discovered a publisher willing to back his unconventional music.  He was, along with Ralph Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten, one of the giants of 20th-century British music.   In this moving memoir, Susana Walton has created an intimate and revealing portrait of this great English composer, recounting his entire career and their thirty-five years of marriage. The book brims with colorful anecdotes of some of the people who played a part in Walton's life, including the Sitwells, Laurence Olivier (for whose three Shakespeare movies Walton composed the score), Benjamin Britten, Maria Callas, Lord Kenneth Clark, W.H. Auden, Yehudi Menuhin, and Julian Bream. Packed with numerous photographs, many of which have never before been published, this charming volume offers many insights into Walton, the composer and the man.",

        "Title": "Aging: A Natural History (Scientific American Library)",
        "Authors": "By Ricklefs, Robert E. and Finch, Caleb Ellicott",
        "Description": "The process of aging is familiar to, and usually dreaded by, all of us. We all know what it feels like to grow older, but what exactly is aging, why does it happen, and can anything be done to slow or prevent it?An original treatment of human aging that draws on biomedical research and the natural history of animals and plants, Aging: A Natural History describes this biological phenomenon in fascinating detail, helping the reader to understand its complex processes. In the aging patterns of humans and many other species, biologists Robert E. Ricklefs and Caleb E. Finch find some answers to why aging must exist at all, and why it is so spectacularly different in different species.The authors ask a variety of compelling questions: How can processes that lead to death be such an integral part of life itself? Why do some species tend to die at an early age when close relatives may live much longer? Why do many species age, when others seem not to? And, perhaps most importantly, why is aging, which is so detrimental to the individual, maintained by natural selection? Finally, the authors consider the prospects for prolonging human life and improving the quality of life at older ages. Concluding that aging is induced both by environmental factors and by the biochemical processes normally present in all cells, they show aging to be an inevitable yet alterable part of life - a natural process that may limit activity but is not necessarily debilitating.",

        "Title": "Jefferson and the Gun-Men: How the West Was Almost Lost",
        "Authors": "By Montgomery, M. R.",
        "Description": "Just three decades after the revolution that gave birth to the United States, another insurgency was already brewing, this time led by a charming - and treacherous - Aaron Burr. The former vice president had determined that if he could not be master of his nation, he would instead become emperor of the Louisiana Territory. Working with the powerful commander of the U.S. Army, General James Wilkinson, Burr instigated a plot to seize not only Louisiana, but all of Mexico. This nefarious plot even included the hapless Zebulon M. Pike.Jefferson and the Gun-men is the story of this scheme. Montgomery portrays a time when the wildest plots and the most grandiose dreams thrived as schemers, revolutionaries, black-guards, and braggarts conspired to create a new country. In this race to capture the heart of a new frontier, Montgomery finds a young nation just beginning to imagine itself and understand its destiny.",
