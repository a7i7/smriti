Then a rogue infection of nanotechnology transforms him into a \"demon\", something more than human, and he is forced into exile, fleeing to the more technologically advanced space-faring civilization that lies to the north, one that his own righteous people consider evil. Although shaken by his transformation, he has the rare talent required to become a space pilot. What no one, least of all Tyndel, expects, is his deep-space encounter with a vastly superior being--perhaps with God.",

        "Title": "Fractals: Endlessly Repeated Geometrical Figures",
        "Authors": "By Lauwerier, Hans and Gill-Hoffstadt, Sophia (TRN)",
        "Description": "Fractals are shapes in which an identical motif repeats itself on an ever diminishing scale. A coastline, for instance, is a fractal, with each bay or headland having its own smaller bays and headlands--as is a tree with a trunk that separates into two smaller side branches, which in their turn separate into side branches that are smaller still. No longer mathematical curiosities, fractals are now a vital subject of mathematical study, practical application, and popular interest. For readers interested in graphic design, computers, and science and mathematics in general, Hans Lauwerier provides an accessible introduction to fractals that makes only modest use of mathematical techniques. Lauwerier calls this volume a \"book to work with.\" Readers with access to microcomputers can design new figures, as well as re-create famous examples. They can start with the final chapter, try out one of the programs described there (preferably in a compiled version such as TURBO BASIC), and consult the earlier chapters for whatever is needed to understand the fractals produced in this way. The first chapter, which builds on the relationship of binary number systems to the \"tree fractal\" described above, is the best place to start if one has no computer. There will be much to enjoy on the way, including the beautiful color illustrations.",

We weren't made for each other,but we turned out to be exactly what the other needed.\"A highly decorated captain in the U.S. Army, Luis Montalv\u00e1n never backed down from a challenge during his two tours of duty in Iraq. After returning home from combat, however, the pressures of his physical wounds, traumatic brain injury, and crippling post-traumatic stress disorder began to take their toll. Haunted by the war and in constant physical pain, he soon found himself unable to climb a simple flight of stairs or face a bus ride to the VA hospital. He drank; he argued; ultimately, he cut himself off from those he loved. Alienated and alone, unable to sleep or bend over without pain, he began to wonder if he would ever recover.Then Luis met Tuesday, a beautiful and sensitive golden retriever trained to assist the disabled. Tuesday had lived amongst prisoners and at a home for troubled boys, blessing many lives; he could turn on lights, open doors, and sense the onset of anxiety and flashbacks. But because of a unique training situation and sensitive nature, he found it difficult to trust in or connect with a human being-until Luis.Until Tuesday is the story of how two wounded warriors, who had given so much and suffered the consequences, found salvation in each other. It is a story about war and peace, injury and recovery, psychological wounds and spiritual restoration. But more than that, it is a story about the love between a man and dog, and how together they healed each other's souls.",

        "Authors": "By Andrews, Linda Wasmer, Gur, Raquel E., and Snyder, Kurt",
        "Description": "During his second semester at college, Kurt Snyder became convinced that he was about to discover a fabulously important mathematical principle, spending hours lost in daydreams about numbers and symbols. In time, his thoughts took a darker turn, and he became preoccupied with the idea that cars were following him, or that strangers wanted to harm him. Kurt's mind had been hijacked by schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder that typically strikes during the late teen or young adult years. In Me, Myself, and Them, Kurt, now an adult, looks back from the vantage point of recovery and eloquently describes the debilitating changes in thoughts and perceptions that took hold of his life during his teens and twenties. As a memoir, this book is remarkable for its unvarnished look at the slow and difficult process of coming back from severe mental illness. Yet Kurt's memoir is only half the story. With the help of psychiatrist Raquel E. Gur, M.D., Ph.D., and veteran science writer Linda Wasmer Andrews, Kurt paints the big picture for others affected by adolescent schizophrenia. Drawing on the latest scientific and medical evidence, he explains how to recognize warning signs, where to find help, and what treatments have proved effective. Kurt also offers practical advice on topics of particular interest to young people, such as suggestions on managing the illness at home, school, and work, and in relationships with family and friends.     Part of the Adolescent Mental Health Initiative series of books written specifically for teens and young adults, My, Myself, and Them offers hope to young people who are struggling with schizophrenia, helping them to understand and manage the challenges of this illness and go on to lead healthy lives.",

Despite her own mother's warnings, Tessa has recently given up her career to focus on her family and the pursuit of domestic happiness. From the outside, she seems destined to live a charmed life. Valerie Anderson is an attorney and single mother to six-year-old Charlie--a boy who has never known his father. After too many disappointments, she has given up on romance--and even to some degree, friendships--believing that it is always safer not to expect too much.Although both women live in the same Boston suburb, the two have relatively little in common aside from a fierce love for their children. But one night, a tragic accident causes their lives to converge in ways no one could have imagined. In alternating, pitch-perfect points of view, Emily Giffin's Heart of the Matter creates a moving, luminous story of good people caught in untenable circumstances. Each being tested in ways they never thought possible. Each questioning everything they once believed. And each ultimately discovering what truly matters most.",

She's intelligent-she aced AP physics; athletic-a former state-ranked tennis doubles champion; and beautiful. She is, in short, everything her mother, Elizabeth, hoped she could be. The family's move to Landsdale, with stepfather James in tow, hadn't been as bumpy as Elizabeth feared.  But as the school year draws to a close, there are disturbing signs that the life Rosie claims to be leading is a sham, and that Elizabeth's hopes for her daughter to remain immune from the pull of the darker impulses of drugs and alcohol are dashed. Slowly and against their will, Elizabeth and James are forced to confront the fact that Rosie has been lying to them-and that her deceptions will have profound consequences.  This is Anne Lamott's most honest and heartrending novel yet, exploring our human quest for connection and salvation as it reveals the traps that can befall all of us.",

In between the peaks and valleys, Marilyn began to see a pattern that led to a greater understanding of herself and a richer happiness in life.She says, \u201cWe crave connection with the ones we love most, and when our bond with them is broken, damaged, or threatened, we fear being left. We fear abandonment.\u201dLove Me, Never Leave Me tells you that desiring a love that never leaves is natural, that there are ways to turn feelings of being abandoned into experiences of emotional abundance, and to know that you are God\u2019s beloved child\u2014and he will never leave you or forsake you. \u00a0\"Thanks Marilyn for helping me make some sense to me. What a relief! Everyone I know is going to love this book. And you make me laugh. That's my kind of reading! By the way, I recommend people read in a room with chocolate cupcakes nearby. They'll know what I'm talking about as soon as they start the book; everybody's doing it.\" ?Sherri Shepherd, actress and co-host of The View\"I do not know one single person who has not felt forgotten or abandoned sometime in life. I so recommend Marilyn's fantastic book. It is helping me way more than I even thought I needed. Grab a cupcake and settle in with me for a healing read. You'll thank me I promise!\" ?Sandi Patty, singer, writer, speaker",

He recruits a more experienced sailor-another brokenhearted guy-and together they set sail for Tahiti, hoping to burn away their miseries in hard miles at sea.At first Patterson finds life under sail distinctly less heroic than the travel literature that has inspired him.  But when his companion remains behind, Patterson single-handedly sails his boat across the North Pacific and through a perilous four-day gale, truly testing himself against the elements.",

Combining humor, unusual depth of vision, and a childlike charm, this \"Mozart with a paintbrush\" seems to speak a universal language, stirring both children and their parents, art critics and those who would otherwise never step into a gallery.Outside the Lines, showcasing fifty of Alexandra's recent works, will dazzle people around the world with the artist's brilliant color combinations, startling compositions, and her simple, moving narratives about the daily inspirations to express herself through painting.",

Running a pub in the tiny Australian outback town of Wollegudgerie doesn\u2019t offer much fun or future to knockabout Aussie dyke Kylie Kendall. So when the father she never knew dies and leaves her 51 percent of his Los Angeles-based private detective agency, it\u2019s bright lights, big city for America-bound Kylie. Not so happy about her arrival is her father\u2019s former (and Kylie\u2019s new) business partner, the beautiful, enigmatic Arianna Creeling, who wants to buy out Kylie and gives her a decidedly chilly reception in sunny Southern California. But the two women soon have other matters besides their bickering to attend to. Dr. Deer, psychiatrist to the stars whose \u201cslap, slap, get on with it\u201d approach has made him a celebrity, hires them to investigate the theft of records and subsequent suicide of a successful but almost universally reviled film director. Concerned for his reputation, Dr. Deer would much prefer that the death of his former client be revealed to be a murder. As the sparks between Arianna and Kylie fly, the City of Angels has turned out to be much more difficult and dangerous than Kylie had imagined.Transplanted Australian Claire McNab has written 18 best-selling mystery novels, 14 featuring the highly popular Detective-Inspector Carol Ashton and four featuring undercover agent Denise Cleever. She has served as the president of Sisters in Crime and is a member of both the Mystery Writers of America and the Science Fiction Writers of America. She lives in Los Angeles.",

Discover the ultimate true crime story of passion and betrayal, where the clues point to murder.Thrust onto Egypt's most powerful throne at the age of nine, King Tut's reign was fiercely debated from the outset. Behind the palace's veil of prosperity, bitter rivalries and jealousy flourished among the Boy King's most trusted advisors, and after only nine years, King Tut suddenly perished, his name purged from Egyptian history. To this day, his death remains shrouded in controversy. Now, in The Murder of King Tut, James Patterson and Martin Dugard dig through stacks of evidence-X-rays, Carter's files, forensic clues, and stories told through the ages-to arrive at their own account of King Tut's life and death. The result is an exhilarating true crime tale of intrigue, passion, and betrayal that casts fresh light on the oldest mystery of all.",
