        "Description": "Billy Graham: God's Ambassador is a retrospective on the remarkable life and career of this living legend, witnessed and compiled by his longtime photographer, Russ Busby.

Throughout, there emerges an intimate and unique portrait of a man who dedicated his life to the Gospel and became one of the century's most influential figures.",

        "Description": "This is not a weight-loss book, but rather a collection of wonderfully delicious recipes to prepare every day in your own kitchen. Simmons has trimmed the fat from these down-home favorites, and throughout the book Richard shares his \"Farewell To Fat\" wisdom, which has helped so many people to get down the pounds - millions, in fact.Before Simmons jumps into his favorite subject, the recipes, he tells all in chapter 1, \"Welcome to My Kitchen.\" Here he describes the six basic kinds of eaters (he's two of them); the Three Fat Sisters; his Holy Trinity (Sacred Fat, Sacred Sweet, and Sacred Salt); the Portion Patrol; deciphering the new food labels; how to use fresh spices; what basic kitchen equipment you need; and much, much more.And then there's the food. These are recipes steeped in American tradition - dishes passed on from one generation to another, and now updated with flavorful twists from Richard's own kitchen. The recipes are easy to fix; and each one includes preparation time, a nutrition analysis with the percentage of calories from fat, and Richard's personal anecdotes about the food.Throughout the book, Simmons offers easy-to-understand tips and special \"tricks\" for making everyday food fit into a healthy life plan - no complicated calculations or exotic foods, just Richard at his fun-loving best showing you how to eat well using food you already know. He tells you, among other things, how to get the fat out of food, the most effective low-fat cooking techniques, how to meet the butcher, what to do with leftover potato cooking water, and the secret of the special Simmons Roasted Garlic Potion.",

It saw the  surrender of Vicksburg and the retreat of  General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia after a crushing defeat at Gettysburg. In interweaving  the narratives of these two storied battles,  Duane Schultz has presented a compelling  blow-by-blow account of what is arguably the  most pivotal point of the entire conflict. All  the players are brought to life here, whether it is Lincoln agonizing in the telegraph office  while he waits for news from Generals Grant and  Meade, General Pete Longstreet trying to cajole  Lee into revising his plan of attack, or the  women of the towns of Vicksburg and Gettysburg  coming under fire and tending to the legions of  wounded. We see a nation in the midst of its  greatest convulsion, and we see that, while the  \"Glorious Fourth\" dashed the greatest  hopes of the Confederacy, the war was far from  over.",

When a plague-like outbreak strikes Indonesia and a team of American biological-warfare experts are brought in to discover its source, they find only corpses and riddles without answers - until Holly Becker arrives.

As his friends disappear around him - victims of the streets, of police dogs, of drugs, of an addiction to cheap thrills and guns - Darnell struggles to establish his own business, facing a thousand midnights before he's home free, with a job that supports his young family.Yet even as he gains a tentative sense of self, Darnell Tucker is drawn to the destructive beauty of fires, and to the wilder, untamed forces beyond the structure of domesticity. This search for balance in a dangerous world propels the quiet heroism of a beautifully evoked and very moving story.",

Shockingly, the answer turns out to be \"No.\" Unbeknown to him, at least until that point, his mother, a German Protestant, fell in love during World War II with a Russian Jew and bore his child. Anderson learns this information as a young man but he and his mother keep this secret for another 35 years, until the day Anderson\u2014now an unusually successful publishing executive\u2014meets an unknown brother who, it turns out, has lived a nearly parallel life. Meant To Be is a love story, a journey of self-discovery and spirituality, and a provocative challenge to common notions about the role of heredity in our lives.",

He has come to Livorno to sing on the summer stage with Ada Giachetti, a famous and beautiful soprano. Ada's mother offers him a spare room, and before Ada herself has a chance to meet the unknown tenor, her younger sister, Rina, arrives home from the market and falls fatefully in love.  With the help of singing lessons from Ada, Caruso wins the leading role in Puccini's new opera La Boh\u00e8me. Although Caruso loves Rina, it is Ada he adores, and they soon become lovers. Heartbroken, Rina becomes an opera singer too, hoping to take her sister's place. For decades, the two sisters are locked in a struggle to be the star on Caruso's stage and in his bed, while Caruso's voice grows more and more unimaginably beautiful.  But as his relations with the two sisters break down in scandal and tragedy, the now world-famous Caruso builds a new life for himself as the star of the Metropolitan Opera in New York. There, far from the drama and passion of Caruso's Tuscan life, a shy young American woman will win his heart and, taking the greatest leap of faith of all, supplant Ada and Rina as his one true love.",

Why are reserves of oil, precious metals, and other natural resources more plentiful than ever before? Why has the population growth of the twentieth century brought rising standards of living for nearly all? In The True State of the Planet ten premier scholars shatter the myths of overpopulation, food, global warming, and pesticides, while redirecting environmentalists' concerns to the far more urgent problems of fisheries, fresh water, and third-world pollution -- and the political causes behind them.",

        "Description": "Framing a Life is Geraldine Ferraro's touching memoir of her Italian American family. Like the frame on which her mother once crocheted beads to make a living, Framing a Life draws together a tapestry of immigrant family stories both past and present. Beginning with the arrival of her grandmother Maria Giuseppa Caputo on these shores in 1890, the author takes us on a grand journey that includes her own vice presidential nomination in 1984 and brings us to the present day, spanning a total of five generations.  In the immigrant ghettoes of New York's Lower East Side and Italian Harlem, Maria Giuseppa raised ten children, one of whom was Gerry's mother, Antonetta Corierri. The young Antonetta was forced to leave school after the eighth grade to work as a crochet beader in a garment factory, but she had aspirations to lead a better life. She fulfilled this goal when she married Dominick Ferraro, an up-and-coming Italian immigrant, and they opened a restaurant and store in Newburgh, New York. But her fortunes took a tragic turn when Dominick died suddenly of a heart attack. Determined not to let her dreams of a better life for her son and daughter die with her husband, Antonetta moved to the Bronx and returned to crochet beading to put Carl and Gerry through school. Once, observing Gerry's poor crocheting skills, Antonetta warned her, \"Get an education or you'll starve to death!\" Gerry took heed, becoming a teacher before she turned her attention to the law and to politics.  Antonetta Ferraro's single-mindedness paid off in the ultimate immigrant success story. Geraldine Ferraro, whose grandmother could not read or write and whose mother left school at age fourteen, rose to become a symbol of the American dream -- for all immigrants and for all women.  Throughout Gerry's runs for office, including her vice presidential campaign with Walter Mondale in 1984, Antonetta was a constant presence by her daughter's side. She lived to see one of Gerry's daughters receive an MBA from Harvard but passed away before the other daughter became a doctor.  In Framing a Life Geraldine Ferraro leads us along her family tree, from her Italian roots to the branches that stretch into the future. Throughout, she draws parallels between her own and other immigrant families and the basic values, including religion and the importance of education, that unite them. She notes that contemporary immigrants from Asia and Latin America are no different from our country's European forebears in their circumstances and their dreams of a better life. No matter where one's family originated, Ferraro's story has resonance for us all.",

His beautiful and revealing new book - his first devoted entirely to children's drawings - distills his insights into the ways children from all over the world disclose their deepest convictions, feelings, and dreams with crayon, paint, and pencil.The fifty full-color drawings in Their Eyes Meeting the World were created by boys and girls under ten from richly diverse backgrounds. Here is artwork by children urban and rural, Christian and Jewish and Muslim, children from the United States and from various other nations. In the company of Dr. Coles, we meet Helen, a ten-year-old dying of leukemia, and Ruby, the sole black child in a newly desegregated school. These are children who draw with profound seriousness and passion, and from their pictures Dr. Coles sensitively interprets what matters most in their lives, always attentive to the influence of race, class, region, and historical moment. Most important, he uses the visual worlds children represent to gain entry into their moral, religious, and spiritual lives.It was the poet-physician William Carlos Williams who offered the wisdom that guides Robert Coles's observations of children. \"Look at them, looking,\" he gently advised, \"their eyes meeting the world.\" In place of abstract analysis, Dr. Coles relies on the concreteness of art; he demonstrates with empathy and respect how eloquently children can use color and form to speak from the heart, mind, and soul.",

Yet best-selling author Dr. Tim LaHaye says the cross is vitally significant not just to history, but to our lives today. In this not-to-be-missed study, readers will discover the amazing method God has used to prove His existence-the very method He is using to reach the world today. First God used creation, then revelation, and then Jesus Christ to reveal Himself. Today He reveals Himself by transforming lives-the lives we live and the lives of those around us. Every story of transformation is unique, yet all have one thing in common: the transformation begins at the foot of the cross.",

Down the road lives the Sheehand family: sixteen-year-old Hezekiah, his older sister, Arena, his mentally disabled younger brother, Yellababy, and their disaffected and often cruel mother, Susan Blair, whose husband has abandoned both the house and the family. One day, with Yellababy strapped to his back, Hez sets out for Chalktown, determined to plumb its mysteries, or perhaps just to get away from his shabby home's oppressive atmosphere. And, on that same spring day, the family he's left behind will confront a tragedy that at once erases Hez's bitter past and paves the way for a hopeful future.",

And when you think your partner has been murdered, the script says you do something about it.Phillie had known for years about Jack's sexual conquests, the steady parade of bored housewives and lonely divorcees. After all, infidelity wasn't that unusual in their charmed Long Island circle.

Nothing prepared Phillie either for the onslaught of violent crime and painful betrayal unleashed by his search. Suddenly he is risking everything to find a killer.Phillie used to be faithful - faithful was what he did best. His life was devoted to his suburban values: his kids, his debts, his partner; and most impressively his wife. But the natural rhythm of Phillie's life is beating out of sync.

The Hansel and Gretel: for an afternoon of fun, scamper about the house leaving a trail of plain popped popcorn in your wake.   97 Ways to Make a Dog Smile is a gift of pure pleasure for dogs and the owners who love them. Created by Jenny Langbehn, a veterinary nurse who really knows what makes dogs happy, it combines the creative gift of touch--unexpected ways to rub, massage, scratch, tickle, and knead--with imaginative play scenarios that are just loopy enough to ensure that your dog will be amused, whether he's laughing with you or at you. And to heighten the pleasure of both reader and dog, adorable full-color photographs of smiling dogs accompany each entry. Just look at those dogs (you might say), what a tail-wagging, chop-licking, howling good time they're having. And see if your dog doesn't agree.  Try In a Nutshell, the classic sleight-of-hand game, by hiding a treat under one of three plastic cups. The Lawrence Welk--dogs love to chase soap bubbles even more than toddlers do. Get fit while playing. Or use Subliminal Advertising, which works by sneaking a favorite word like cookie into an otherwise boring rant. You'll be surprised by how closely your dog pays attention to what you say, and how broad the smile will be when he hears that special word. Just be sure to have said cookie on hand.",

Side by side, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, their children, and their comrades in the Galactic Alliance rally for their last stand against the enemy that threatens not only the galaxy, but the Force itself.The Galactic Alliance\u2019s hard-won success in countering the Yuuzhan Vong onslaught has proven all too brief\u2014and the tide has turned once more to the invaders\u2019 advantage. Having overcome the sabotage strategies of the Jedi and their allies, the marauding aliens have pushed deeper into the galaxy and subjugated more worlds in their ruthless quest for domination. Coruscant has been remade into a Yuuzhan Vong stronghold. The remnants of the resistance are struggling to form a united front. Luke, Mara, and Jacen are missing in action. Clearly the stage is set for endgame. Now, as Han and Leia receive the chilling news that hundreds of high-ranking Galactic Alliance prisoners face slaughter in a sacrifice to the enemy\u2019s bloodthirsty gods, Luke and his team try desperately to convince the living world of Zonama Sekot to join the Jedi\u2019s final campaign against the Yuuzhan Vong. Yet even as they speak, a lone space station is all that stands between Alliance headquarters on Mon Calamari . . . and wave after wave of ferocious enemy forces waging their most decisive assault.At the same time, the Jedi\u2019s alliances throughout the galaxy are being tested\u2014and the chances of victory jeopardized\u2014by rogue factions determined to deploy the lethal weapon that will exterminate the Yuuzhan Vong . . . and perhaps countless other species. And among the Yuuzhan Vong themselves, the threat of revolt has reached a boiling point\u2014as the oppressed underclass and powerful officials alike fear their Supreme Overlord\u2019s mad actions will provoke the wrath of the gods.Ultimately, for both the forces of invasion and resistance, too much has been sacrificed \u2014and too much is at stake\u2014to ever turn back.

Bush, the Ivory Tower, Steven Spielberg, and Terri Gross have in common?Does a political scandal make for good news copy?Does network programming allow us to unwind from a day's work?Does the art at the local museum make for pleasant cocktail conversation?An unflinching and wry look at the dumbing down of the American imagination.      In this groundbreaking and incisive exploration, acclaimed social critic Curtis White describes an all-encompassing and little-noticed force taking over our culture and our lives. White calls this force the Middle Mind -- the current failure of the American imagination in the media, politics, education, art, technology, and religion.The Middle Mind is pragmatic, plainspoken, populist, contemptuous of the right's narrowness, and incredulous before the left's convolutions. It wants to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and has bought an SUV with the intent of visiting it. It even understands in some indistinct way how that very SUV spells the Arctic's doom.      The Middle Mind is not about left or right, highbrow or lowbrow, academia or pop culture; in fact, it pervades society without discrimination. The danger is not in a specific point of view, but rather in how the Middle Mind thrives in the common ground of unquestioned mediocrity. All we seem to ask about the culture we experience is whether it's entertaining.       White argues that we have forgotten how to read, to watch, to think for ourselves. Because it is neutral, widespread, and easily digestible, the Middle Mind has lulled the American imagination to sleep. As we sit comfortably amused and distracted, just outside the door there is an immediate crisis of a nation blindly following the path of least resistance. Irreverent, provocative, and far-reaching, White presents a clear vision of this dangerous mindset that threatens America's intellectual and cultural freedoms, concluding with an imperative to reawaken and unleash the once powerful American imagination.",

        "Description": "Mind Over Golf Whether you struggle to break 100 or consistently break par, you've already discovered that golf is the most mentally demanding of all sports. Dr. Richard Coop, one of the foremost sports psychologists in the country, has developed a unique mental approach to the game, helping both skilled pros and beginning amateurs alike to play better. Mind Over Golf examines all the demanding psychological challenges of golf and explains in detail how to conquer them. Golfers have discovered that there are ways to lower their scores that go beyond getting tips on their swing and stance. In order to play better, you have to find the key that allows your natural athletic ability to come to the fore, without being impeded by anxiety about making a poor shot. By following Dr. Coop's principles and ideas you'll be in the strongest possible position, both physically and mentally, to put your best swing on each shot. As Payne Stewart says in his foreword to Mind Over Golf, \"\"Not everyone can swing like a tour pro, but most everyone has it within himself or herself to think like one, and Dr. Coop lays the foundation for that within these pages.\"\" Visit us online at http://www.mcp.com/mgr/macmillan",

I don't know why.\u201d  But they do try to communicate, with a  short-order cook in a small desert town serving as their reluctant confidant. Odd  Thomas thinks of himself as an ordinary guy, if possessed of a certain measure of  talent at the Pico Mundo Grill and rapturously in love with the most beautiful girl  in the world, Stormy Llewellyn.  Maybe he has a gift, maybe it\u2019s a curse, Odd has  never been sure, but he tries to do his best by the silent souls who seek him out.  Sometimes they want justice, and Odd\u2019s otherworldly tips to Pico Mundo's sympathetic  police chief, Wyatt Porter, can solve a crime. Occasionally they can prevent one.  But this time it's different.  A mysterious man comes to town with a voracious appetite,  a filing cabinet stuffed with information on the world's worst killers, and a pack  of hyena-like shades following him wherever he goes. Who the man is and what he wants,  not even Odd\u2019s deceased informants can tell him. His most ominous clue is a page  ripped from a day-by-day calendar for August 15.    Today is August 14.  In less  than twenty-four hours, Pico Mundo will awaken to a day of catastrophe.  As evil  coils under the searing desert sun, Odd travels through the shifting prisms of his  world, struggling to avert a looming cataclysm with the aid of his soul mate and  an unlikely community of allies that includes the King of Rock 'n' Roll. His account  of two shattering days when past and present, fate and destiny converge is the stuff  of our worst nightmares\u2014and a testament by which to live: sanely if not safely, with  courage, humor, and a full heart that even in the darkness must persevere.",

        "Title": "The Faith of the American Soldier",
        "Authors": "By Mansfield, Stephen",
        "Description": "An exploration of the major wars in U.S. history as seen through the religious faith of the men and women serving in the military.  Since men and women in battle not only face the prospect of their own deaths but also must fashion a moral rationale for killing, the battlefield is often a place of tremendous religious transformation.  Do men and women at war revert to the faith of their youth or do they gravitate to the spirituality around them? Do they lose all faith in the face of horror, or do they piece together an informal faith that simply gets them through the fight? Are they better warriors and do they experience less post-traumatic stress if they believe their war is righteous and that they are agents of good? These are the questions Stephen Mansfield addresses in The Faith of the American Soldier.  The book opens with the core question which lies at the heart of the matter: what happens religiously to America's warriors when they go to battle, and what impact does this have on the nation's conduct of war? Mansfield surveys America's wars from a theological perspective in order to understand the theological framing and religious rationale for each, where they came from, and what effect they had on behavior on the battlefield.  Mansfield examines the religious nature of the warrior ethic today. There is a new generation on the battlefield now, one raised with less religious training and less connection to history than any that has come before. Soldiers are left to their own religious choices to frame their moral perspectives on war, on killing, and on the possibility of death. Mansfield explores these choices through the lens of his deep respect for the military-he comes from a long line of U.S. Army officers-and from his background as a Ph.D. in American history, and his more than twenty years' experience as a pastor.",

He allows us to feel their splendor, and to experience the powerful role that dreams and near-death experiences have held throughout the centuries. And in the dazzling final chapter, he delivers a Gnostic sermon in which he urges us toward transcendence.",

With Lord Salisbury's future looking uncertain, the political climate is perfect for an evil man with selfish ambitions to put himself forward as a Tory candidate. That man is Charles Voisey, whom Thomas Pitt recently defeated.Despite being thanked by Queen Victoria herself for the courage and loyalty he showed in the Whitechapel case, Pitt has been demoted from his position as Superintendent of Bow Street police to work in Special Branch: a mark of revenge by the Inner Circle. And now, Pitt's first case is to obtain every piece of information he can that might stop Voisey winning his Tory seat and beginning the climb to a power which would corrupt the justiciary of the land.Within hours of beginning his investigation into Voisey's affairs, Pitt is commanded by his superior to go to Southampton Row, where the murder of a famous medium, Maude Lamont, has been reported. Totally bewildered as to why this should be related to his task with Special Branch, Pitt arrives at the house. The murder was grotesque - and personal. Who were Maude Lamont's clients the night she died? Who had she claimed to call up from the past? And what had they revealed that had ended in murder?As a link is revealed between the spiritualist and the political figures Pitt is investigating, the whispers of scandal, violence and assault grow louder. And with his wife, Charlotte, hiding for safety with their children in the country, Pitt must turn to his sister-in-law Emily for help in solving one of his most high profile cases yet.",
