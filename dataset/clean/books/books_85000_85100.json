Now, London has delivered The Good Parents, a tender and compelling tale of mother love and the harrowing moment when a daughter spreads her wings and vanishes from her parents\u2019 orbit. Maya de Jong is an eighteen-year-old country girl who moves to Melbourne and begins an affair with her new boss. When Maya\u2019s parents, Toni and Jacob, arrive for a visit, Maya is gone?no one knows where. Maya, for reasons of her own, leaves haunting clues in late-night calls to her brother at home, carefully avoiding detection by the two people who love her most. Ultimately, to find her daughter Toni will have to revisit a part of her past that she thought she had shut off forever?the closest she ever came to being a lost girl herself. The Good Parents is at once utterly contemporary and a story as old as humanity itself: a stunning portrait of familial love and how far we can drift apart in the moments between the words we speak.",

        "Authors": "By Weil, Andrew",
        "Description": "A landmark book that shows us exactly how we have let health and medicine become a crisis in our society and what we can all do to resolve it. Healthcare is no longer just a public issue; for millions of Americans it is now a crisis on their own doorstep. Cost of medical care today are a leading cause of personal bankruptcy. Although policy makers have weighed in on all sides, in this book, bestselling author Andrew Weil, M.D., identifies the root of the problem. He shows us exactly how we have become embroiled in the present situation and provides a solution that will not only make healthcare affordable, but will also put each one of us on the road to optimum health. Dr. Weil states that we have a right to good healthcare that is effective, accessible, and affordable. Many Americans would be surprised to know that our national health is far from the best in the world, even though we spend more money on it than any other country. The World Health Organization recently rated America thirty-seventh in health outcomes, on par with Serbia. Tackling head-on the Three Major Myths of American Medicine, Dr. Weil shows how medical schools fail to give future doctors the education they need to care for patients, how insurance companies have destroyed our opportunity to get excellent care, and how pharmaceutical companies have come to rule our lives. The solution involves nothing less than the creation of a completely new culture of health and medicine in this country, one that we can each start building today.",

        "Description": "\u201cLife is short, and the Art so long; the occasion fleeting; experience fallacious; and judgment difficult. The physician must not only be prepared to do what is right himself, but also to make the patient, the attendants, and the externals, cooperate.\u201d\u2013attributed to Hippocrates, c. 400 B.C.E.The award-winning author of How We Die and The Art of Aging, venerated physician Sherwin B. Nuland has now written his most thoughtful and engaging book. The Uncertain Art is a superb collection of essays about the vital mix of expertise, intuition, sound judgment, and pure chance that plays a part in a doctor\u2019s practice and life.Drawing from history, the recent past, and his own life, Nuland weaves a tapestry of compelling stories in which doctors have had to make decisions in the face of uncertainty. Topics include the primitive (and sometimes illegal) procedures doctors once practiced with good intentions, such as grave robbing and prescribing cocaine as an anesthetic (which resulted in a physician becoming America\u2019s first cocaine addict); the curious \u201ccures\u201d for irregularity touted by people from the ancient Egyptians to the cereal titan John Harvey Kellogg and bodybuilder Charles Atlas; and healers grappling with today\u2019s complex moral and ethical quandaries, from cloning to gene therapy to the adoption of Eastern practices like acupuncture.Nuland also recounts his most dramatic experiences in a forty-year medical career: the time he was called out of the audience of a Broadway play to help a man having a heart attack (when no other doctor there would respond), and how he formed a profound friendship with an unforgettable\u2013and doomed\u2013heart patient. Behind these inspiring accounts always lie the mysteries of the human body and human nature, the manner in which the ill can will themselves back to health and the odd and essential interactions between a body\u2019s own healing mechanisms and a doctor\u2019s prescriptions.Riveting and wise, amusing and heartrending, The Uncertain Art is Sherwin Nuland\u2019s best work, gems from a man who has spent his professional life acting in the face of ambiguity and sharing what he has learned.",

Morosely baby-sitting geese and stewing about his future, he's about to make a classic mistake: He doesn't take his newest client seriously.The girl, a perfect doll, had waited for him on his doorstep, tapping a tiny foot in a golden sandal, her loyal retainers hanging about within earshot. Her voice was petulant when she told him someone in her family wanted to kill her; he should have noticed the fear in her eyes.With domestic troubles of his own, Falco sent her home. For one thing, a lion had eaten his brother-in-law, leaving his sister and her children impoverished. For another, the sweet young thing wanting to hire him was only six years old. That was before Gaia Laelia, the leading candidate to become the next Vestal Virgin living in the sanctum santorum, disappeared.Hounded by his own guilt and the \"I told you so's\" of his all-too-perceptive wife, Helena, Falco joins the hunt, both helped and hindered by Helena's brother and his clueless new partner. The twisting trail will lead to a gruesome murder and into the cold-blooded intrigues of those who practice rites both sacred and profane. Here, in the temples of Rome, piety is a cousin to madness, and lust and religious fervor are just a hair's breadth apart.

One moonlit night, LAPD veteran Dana Vaughn and \"Hollywood\" Nate Weiss, a struggling-actor-turned cop, get a call about a young man who's been attacking women.  Meanwhile, two surfer cops known as Flotsam and Jetsam keep bumping into an odd, suspicious duo--a smooth-talking player in dreads and a crazy-eyed, tattooed biker.  No one suspects that all three dubious characters might be involved in something bigger, more high-tech, and much more illegal.  After a dizzying series of twists, turns, and chases, the cops will find they've stumbled upon a complex web of crime where even the criminals can't be sure who's conning whom.  Wambaugh once again masterfully gets inside the hearts and minds of the cops whose jobs have them constantly on the brink of danger.  By turns heart-wrenching, exhilarating, and laugh-out-loud funny, Hollywood Moon is his most thrilling and deeply affecting ride yet through the singular streets of LA.",

Never has Cherry Adair\u2013award-winning author of Hot Ice\u2013burned the pages with so much blazing action and blistering passion. Professional art restorer Emily Greene is in no mood to see the devil-may-care Max Aries. She hasn\u2019t forgotten\u2013or forgiven\u2013the way Max dropped into her life a year ago, stole her heart, then vanished without a word. Max hadn\u2019t kept in touch with his father, Daniel, either. Daniel Aries had been a master of art restoration and reproduction, and not only Emily\u2019s longtime mentor, but a trusted friend. His unexpected suicide devastates her. And when the prodigal playboy Max returns, her welcome is less than warm\u2013even though his timely arrival in her bedroom saves her from a lethal intruder. But her fury gives way to fear when Max reveals that his father\u2019s death was actually murder . . . and that Emily\u2019s life is now in danger. Like it or not, to stay alive, Emily must put herself in Max\u2019s hands. And once upon a time, that wasn\u2019t such a bad place to be.But what killer would target professional restorers of Renaissance artworks? Max suspects that a pencil sketch found in his father\u2019s studio, inscribed with a cryptic code, may hold the key. His hunch is confirmed when intel from his control at the counterterrorist organization T-FLAC reveals that the Black Rose terror cell is involved\u2013a chilling revelation that elevates the threat level almost as high as the tension that\u2019s bristling between Max and Emily. Max isn\u2019t about to take his eyes off Emily\u2013though only partly for professional reasons\u2013and even Emily\u2019s rage over Max\u2019s take-charge attitude can\u2019t compare to her anger at herself for so long denying the truer, deeper feelings she has for him. As they crisscross Europe, piecing together the shocking clues to an insidious international plot, dodging increasingly lethal traps, and passionately making up for too much lost time, they realize that\u2013in more ways than one\u2013they can\u2019t live without each other. With no chance of turning back, Max and Emily must put their lives on the line, put their true feelings to the test . . . and get ready to take the heat.",

        "Description": "The definitive biography of one of the most important American writers and cultural intellectuals of the twentieth century\u2014Ralph Ellison, author of the masterpiece Invisible Man.In 1953, Ellison\u2019s explosive story of an innocent young black man\u2019s often surreal search for truth and his identity won him the National Book Award for fiction and catapulted him to national prominence. Ellison went on to earn many other honors, including two presidential medals and election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, but his failure to publish a second novel, despite years of striving, haunted him for the rest of his life. Now, as the first scholar given complete access to Ellison\u2019s papers, Arnold Rampersad has written not only a reliable account of the main events of Ellison\u2019s life but also a complex, authoritative portrait of an unusual artist and human being.Born poor and soon fatherless in 1913, Ralph struggled both to belong to and to escape from the world of his childhood. We learn here about his sometimes happy, sometimes harrowing years growing up in Oklahoma City and attending Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Arriving in New York in 1936, he became a political radical before finally embracing the cosmopolitan intellectualism that would characterize his dazzling cultural essays, his eloquent interviews, and his historic novel. The second half of his long life brought both widespread critical acclaim and bitter disputes with many opponents, including black cultural nationalists outraged by what they saw as his elitism and misguided pride in his American citizenship. This biography describes a man of magnetic personality who counted Saul Bellow, Langston Hughes, Robert Penn Warren, Richard Wright, Richard Wilbur, Albert Murray, and John Cheever among his closest friends; a man both admired and reviled, whose life and art were shaped mainly by his unyielding desire to produce magnificent art and by his resilient faith in the moral and cultural strength of America.A magisterial biography of Ralph Waldo Ellison\u2014a revelation of the man, the writer, and his times.",

Internationally recognized as the voice of reason and compassion, Dr. Elkind showed that in blurring the boundaries of what is age appropriate, by expecting-or imposing-too much too soon, we force our kids to grow up far too fast.In the two decades since this groundbreaking book first appeared, we have compounded the problem, inadvertently stepping up the assault on childhood in the media, in schools, and at home. Taking a detailed, up-to-the-minute look at the world of today's children and teens in terms of the Internet, classroom culture, school violence, movies, television, and a growing societal incivility, Dr. Elkind shows a whole new generation of parents where hurrying occurs and why and what we can do about it.",

        "Authors": "By Page, Jake and Officer, Charles",
        "Description": "In Maryland, late in the spring of 1816, the snow fell brown, and blue, and even red. Brown snow fell in Hungary that year, and in the village of Taranto in southern Italy, where any snow is rare, the red and yellow snow caused great alarm. In New England, 1816 was called the Year Without a Summer. Crops failed throughout America, the price of corn and wheat soared, and farmers (lacking feed) sold off livestock, bringing about a collapse in beef and pork prices. In Western Europe, it was even worse, a major disaster, with food riots and armed groups raiding bakeries and grain markets. This turmoil followed a catastrophic volcanic eruption a year earlier on the other side of the world--the April 1815 explosion of the volcano called Tambora, on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa--a blast heard almost a thousand miles away in Sumatra.    In Tales of the Earth, Charles Officer and Jake Page describe some of the great events of environmental history, from natural catastrophes such as the Tambora eruption, the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 (the greatest in recorded history), and the ice ages, to disasters such as the nuclear fallout from Chernobyl, acid rain, and the progressive depletion of the ozone layer. Officer and Page present much of their narrative through eye-witness accounts or through the commentary of prominent figures (in discussing the Lisbon earthquake, for instance, they recount the famous clash between Voltaire and Rousseau over the meaning of the disaster, and in discussing the Black Plague, they quote Boccaccio, whose Decameron was set during \"the late deadly pestilence\"). The authors provide fascinating discussions of meteorites and comets; of the demise of mammoths, mastodons, and dinosaurs; and of great floods that have swept the earth.     But if nature can make trouble for humanity, Officer and Page show that human activity can also make trouble for nature. They examine the depletion of natural resources (we burn coal and oil at millions of times their natural rate of production), air pollution in such major urban areas as Los Angeles and London (where the Killer Smog of 1952 caused the death of some four thousand people), and the pollution of major waterways, like the Chesapeake Bay and Lake Erie. And they explore the global impact of such phenomena as depletion of the ozone layer, acid rain, population growth, and the greenhouse effect.  Ranging from catastrophic eruptions at Santorini and Krakatoa to manmade disasters such as the mercury poisoning in Japan's Minamata Bay, Tales of the Earth will interest anyone concerned with the environment and the natural world.",

Born at the beginning of World War II, Jackie Bong Wright stands at the center of the modern Indochinese drama. \"Autumn Cloud\" follows Ms. Wright as she moves from girlhood on a Cambodian rubber plantation to school in Paris, marries a leading political dissident who is later murdered, escapes to America in 1975 with her children, and makes a new life here with a new American husband.",

The compelling story ranges over the whole of Nat's Life, reaching its inevitable and shattering climax that bloody day in August.  The Confessions of Nat Turner is not only a masterpiece of storytelling; is also reveals in unforgettable human terms the agonizing essence of Negro slavery.  Through the mind of a slave, Willie Styron has re-created a catastrophic event, and dramatized the intermingled miseries, frustrations--and hopes--which caused this extraordinary black man to rise up out of the early mists of our history and strike down those who held his people in bondage.From the Hardcover edition.",
