        "Description": "It is such a small country, yet it occupies such a large place in the hearts and souls of so many diverse peoples. To Christians, it is the Holy Land. To Moslems, the lost land of Palestine. To Jews, it is Eretz Yisrael, the ancient homeland heroically reestablished after 2,000 years. This scrap of desert - center stage for many of the world's miracles and spiritual struggles for 5,000 years - was a rich subject for the world's top photojournalists during one 24-hour period in May 1994.More than sixty photographers from more than a dozen countries left the world's newsfronts to participate in A Day in the Life of Israel. They flew to Tel Aviv from Los Angeles and Lima, New Delhi and New York, Melbourne, Madrid and Moscow. Since many were Day in the Life veterans, they came expecting to make \"extraordinary pictures of an ordinary day.\" But by chance, A Day in the Life of Israel turned out to be anything but ordinary. May 5 was a landmark in the country's history - the first day of official peace between the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization since the founding of the Jewish state. The photographers witnessed a country at the crossroads. On this day, there arrived in Israel, the first real chance that all of the children of Israel might live out their lives in peace.What else did the photographers find during their marathon 24-hour photo shoot? In one small land - 260 miles long and less than 100 miles wide - they found Russian Jews just off the plane from Moscow and tribes of Bedouin that have wandered the Negev desert for thousands of years; Hassidim in black garb unchanged since the 18th century and white-coated scientists in the ultra-modern laboratories of the Weizmann Institute; fashion designers in Tel Aviv and fourth generation farmers on a kibbutz. They encountered deep love for the land and ancient tribal hatreds, all woven into the complexities of a modern political state.",

All the letters that Mrs. Leeper sends to the office are in cursive, and Maggie thinks they are written about her. But there's only way to know for sure...so what's Maggie going to do?For generations, Beverly Cleary has captivated readers of all ages with beloved characters such as Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, Ribsy, and Ralph S. Mouse. Muggie Maggie follows suit with what School Library Journal calls \"a likable, funny heroine whom readers will want to know.\"",

Due to the low cost of hermit crabs, too many keepers carelessly allow their pets to die unnecessarily.

Bright, wry, blunt, and irreverent, she invites you to witness her family's unraveling. Her Harvard-bound sister is anorexic, her mother is having an affair, her father is obsessed with the Food Network, and her grandfather wants to plan her wedding (even though she has no fianc\u00e9, let alone a steady boyfriend). By turns wickedly funny and heartbreakingly bittersweet, Hunger Point chronicles Frannie's triumph over her own self-destructive tendencies, and offers a powerful exploration of the complex relationships that bind together a contemporary American family. You will never forget Frannie, a \"sultry, suburban Holden Caulfield,\" whom critics have called \"the most fully realized character to come along in years,\" (Paper) nor will you forget Hunger Point, an utterly original novel that stuns with its amazing insights and dazzles with its fresh, distinctive voice.",

Strikingly bold, colorful pictures and a simple text in large, clear type tell the story of a hungry little caterpillar's progress through an amazing variety and quantity of foods. Full at last, he made a cocoon around himself and went to sleep, to wake up a few weeks later wonderfully transformed into a butterfly!Brilliantly innovative designer and artist Eric Carle has dramatized the story of one of Nature's commonest yet loveliest marvels, the metamorphosis of the butterfly, in a picture book to delight as well as instruct the very youngest reader or listener. Cleverly die-cut pages show what the caterpillar ate on successive days, graphically introducing sets of up to 10 objects and also the names of the days of the week in rotation, as well as telling the central story of the transformation of the caterpillar. The final, double-page picture of the butterfly is a joyous explosion of color, a vibrant affirmation of the wonder and beauty of Nature.Watch a Video",

She demonstrates how everyone in an organization has the ability to make positive changes, beginning by acknowledging the power they already have. Written in a conversational and supportive style, the book outlines the beliefs, skills, and actions that will enable anyone to welcome and take advantage of change rather than fear and resist it.",

        "Description": "Is there a method to our madness when it comes to shopping? Hailed by the San Francisco Chronicle as \"a Sherlock Holmes for retailers,\" author and research company CEO Paco Underhill answers with a definitive \"yes\" in this witty, eye-opening report on our ever-evolving consumer culture. Why We Buy is based on hard data gleaned from thousands of hours of field research -- in shopping malls, department stores, and supermarkets across America.

I'm sure she loved me more than cleaning, but what made her happiest was combining the two.\"She writes of her father, Roberto Rossellini: \"My father was a Jewish mother.... When we were children (there were seven of us), one of our favorite games was throwing ourselves onto Daddy's body. Lying on his side, he pretended to be the sow and we were the piglets.\"She writes about her famous nude scene in David Lynch's Blue Velvet and of posing for Avedon, Bruce Weber, and Steven Meisel. About being fired as the face of Lancome because she dared to turn forty. About the two years of scoliosis that blighted her adolescence. About acting as opposed to modeling. About being a daughter, a sister, and a mother. About her children: Elettra, who, when asked by her kindergarten teacher what she would do if she got lost in an airport, answered, \"I'd look for my mamma's poster and wait underneath it for help\"; and Roberto, her adopted son. About her unforgettable encounters with Anna Magnani (her father's onetime mistress) and Katharine Hepburn, as well as the peculiar behavior of her many pets. About her wardrobe. About lying. She talks - candidly yet discreetly - about the men in her life: her ex-husband Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Gary Oldman. And she conducts intimate and extended dialogues with her beloved dead ones.",

This is a fictional world where rather than polishing their domestic arts and waiting for marriage proposals, girls are fighting battles, riding stallions, rescuing boys from rivers, cross-dressing, debating religion, hunting, squaring off against angry bulls, or, in what may be the most flagrant flouting of Victorian convention, marrying other women.\u00a0This special edition brings together the best of Twain's stories about unconventional girls and women, from Eve as she names the animals in Eden to Joan of Arc to the transvestite farce of a young man named Alice from the Wapping district of London. Whatever they're doing\u2014bopping boys with a baseball bat in \"Hellfire Hotchkiss,\" treating the author to a life story and a dogsled ride in \"The Esquimau Maiden's Romance,\" or sacrificing all for the sake of a horse, as in \"A Horse's Tale\"\u2014these women and girls are surprising, provocative, and irresistibly entertaining in the great Twain tradition in which they now finally take their rightful place.",

        "Authors": "By Johnson, Cameron, Mann, John David (COL), and Bach, David (FRW)",
        "Description": "Why work for someone else when you can call your own shots, pursue your dreams, and find success on your terms by starting your own business? So many people end up bored with their jobs, stuck in the corporate grind, never following their true passions. As wildly successful young entrepreneur Cameron Johnson shows, you don't have to live that way. We've entered a new age of entrepreneurship, with the Web making it easier than ever to start and run your own company. As Johnson's remarkable story reveals, the entrepreneurial way of life is a great way to make sure you love what you do -- and it offers the potential to achieve extraordinary success by following your gut instincts and going for what you really want.What about the risks? Don't you need lots of money? Don't most start-ups fail? Johnson shares his essential secrets to entrepreneurial success that show you how he got into the life at very low risk, and, with very little money, took an idea that excited him and ran with it, achieving great success and satisfaction with businesses he loved. He didn't have an MBA; he didn't even have a college degree. But he had learned the simple yet vital secrets he reveals. Cameron Johnson is a seriously happy entrepreneur who started his first business when he was nine with $50 and a home computer. Before he'd turned twenty-one he'd started twelve successful businesses and was offered $10 million in venture capital to grow his hot Web company CertificateSwap.com -- praised by Entrepreneur magazine as one of the Web businesses helping the tech industry get its groove back -- even bigger. He has never taken out a loan or racked up any debt, and every one of his businesses has been highly profitable -- so profitable that he made his first million before graduating from high school, and he's put away enough cash so that he could retire today. But that's the last thing on earth he'd want to do; he's much too happy starting up new companies.Through the story of his own impressive career so far, in You Call the Shots, Johnson takes you behind the scenes of entrepreneurial success and empowers you to hit the ground running with your own great business idea, no matter how young you are or how little money you have to invest.",

        "Authors": "By COE, Michael D.",
        "Description": "Breaking the Maya Code tells the story of the last great decipherment of an ancient script. Twenty years ago the ruined monuments of Maya civilization were mute, the hieroglyphic inscriptions on magnificent stelae, temples and palaces largely unread. Today, thanks to an extraordinary scientific breakthrough, these inscribed remains are revealing a history lost to humanity for a millennium.Michael Coe is uniquely placed to give the inside story of this revolution in understanding. Himself a world-renowned Maya scholar, he has known or worked with all the main protagonists over the last thirty years: Yuri Knorosov, the brilliant Russian philologist who opened the way to reading the records; Eric Thompson, the dominant Mayanist of his generation, who vehemently opposed Knorosov; and the succeeding scholars who have vindicated the Russian's pioneer work. Coe interweaves a riveting tale of intellectual attack and counterattack with a full overview of what we now know about the ancient Maya themselves. Far from being the simple, peace-loving stargazers of Thompson's imagination, they emerge as a much more complex culture: obsessed with warfare, dynastic rivalries and ritual bloodletting, yet creators of supreme masterpieces in art and architecture.Numerous examples of Maya writing, as well as enlightening comparisons with other great decipherments, illuminate the narrative. This is a superbly readable detective story, a challenging and informed account of one of the most exciting intellectual adventures of our age.",

Except for one cool girl from Texas, Faith Masters-who's normal enough to help her stay sane and temporarily replace her best friend, Evie. And then there's Jesse-the only thing close enough to drool-worthy on the camp's menu. Cam can totally relate to him, since his basketball-coach Dad sounds a lot like her perfectly thin, successful Mom. It looks like for the next eight weeks, only the issues (and not the food) on Cam's plate will be supersized.",

Popular Irish comedian Brendan O'Carroll chronicles the comic misadventures of this large and lively family with raw humor and great affection. Forced to be mother, father, and referee to her battling clan, the ever-resourceful Agnes Browne occasionally finds a spare moment to trade gossip and quips with her best pal Marion Monks (alias \"The Kaiser\") and even finds herself pursued by the amorous Frenchman who runs the local pizza parlor.Like the novels of Roddy Doyle, The Mammy features pitch-perfect dialogue, lightning wit, and a host of colorful characters. Earthy and exuberant, the novel brilliantly captures the brash energy and cheerful irreverence of working-class Irish life.Now a major motion picture starring\u00a0Anjelica Huston",

        "Description": "The prophets have always taught that we are all One.Why has this most simple and important truth gone unheeded?The world is in political, religious, economic, and ecological crises of our own making. We need a mass spiritual awakening, in which billions truly realize that we are One. This would transform our world: children wouldn't starve, women wouldn't be brutalized, and young men wouldn't die in battle.But could such an awakening ever take place? Could we actively promote it?Yes. There is a way.Eastern traditions say that the energy called \"Ki\" is the common bond directly connecting body, mind, and spirit. For hundreds of years, martial artists have taught students to use the flow of Ki to strengthen the physical body.Now, in Healing Society, Dr. Seung Heun Lee shows how we can use this energy to strengthen our spiritual bodies, to actually experience a direct connection to the ultimate oneness, feeling it with every fiber of our being, knowing it to be the deepest truth. He teaches that this noble enlightenment is meant for everyone, and that by getting into contact wit it, we may illuminate the world and liberate our children's future.",

Their simple mission?fueled by passion for a more open and democratic nation, topnotch and timely information, and the financial support of concerned individuals and organizations?was to jumpstart broad civic dialogue and enable ordinary citizens to effectively voice their political concerns.In the spirit of simplicity and empowering the citizen, this book is an essential \"how to\" for becoming politically informed and involved. In this handbook for change, MoveOn members from around the country have written about what it means to be a responsible member of a democracy?what they have done in the past and what they are now doing to help make the United States more accountable, forward thinking, and a better place to live.The 50 Ways range from simple ideas, such as \"Tell a Friend about a Petition\" to more dynamic suggestions, such as \"Organize a Constituent Meeting,\" and the editors at MoveOn provided action items and resources for those who want to take inspiration a step further.",
