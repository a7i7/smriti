And yes, she's also the sister of Rascal Page, world famous novelist in his own right. So what does Elisabeth do? Much to her family's disappointment, Elisabeth is a pastry chef. And a pretty damn good one, at Beverly, the hottest restaurant in LA. The last relationship Elisabeth had was with Will, a man she grew up with and whose family ran in the same social circles as her family. But Will's constant jaunts around the world have left her lonely and brokenhearted in L.A. That is until Daniel Sullivan bids on one of Elisabeth's pastry tutorials at a charity auction. Daniel is everything her family is not: a basketball coach, a non-intellectual, his family doesn't summer on Martha's Vineyard, and the only metaphors he uses are about passing the ball and being a team player. But somehow they fit. Between her family, Will, and the new cooking show that Elisabeth is recruited to star in, Elisabeth's life is suddenly incredibly new and different--the question is, can she embrace being happy or has her family conditioned her to think she's just not good enough?Liza Palmer expertly depicts a woman trying to come to terms with professional success, personal success, and finally dealing with a family that might love her from the bottom of their heart but doesn't necessarily have her best interest always at heart.",

        "Description": "Brilliant, witty, perceptive essays about fly-fishing, the natural world, and life in general by the acknowledged master of fishing writers.\u201cOnce an angler has become serious about the sport (and \u2018serious\u2019 is the word that\u2019s used), he\u2019ll never again have enough tackle or enough time to use it. And his nonangling friends and family may never again entirely recognize him, either.\u201d In other words, he (or she) will have entered Gierach territory. And fishermen who choose to brave the crowds at the big hold, commune with the buddies at the \u201cfamily pool,\u201d or even wade into questionable waters in the dark of night are sure to recognize themselves in Even Brook Trout Get the Blues.Whether debating bamboo versus graphite rods, describing the pleasure of fishing in pocket waters or during a spring snow in the mountains, or recounting a trip in pursuit of the \u201cfascinatingly ugly\u201d longnose gar, Gierach understands that fly-fishing is more than a sport. It\u2019s a way of life in which patience is (mostly) rewarded, the rhythms of the natural world are appreciated, and the search for the perfect rod or ideal stream is never ending. It is not a life without risks, for as Gierach warns: \u201cThis perspective on things can change you irreparably. If it comes to you early enough in life, it can save you from ever becoming what they call \u2018normal.\u2019\u201d Even Brook Trout Get the Blues will convince you that \u201cnormal\u201d is greatly overrated.",

Singled out     as the only women to have Bible books named after them, Ruth   and Esther lived     in very different worlds, one a poor peasant and the other a   powerful queen.     Yet both dared to do the right thing when confronted with the   easy way out,     and God rewarded them for their courage and commitment.        As you study the Books of Ruth and Esther, you will appreciate   anew the tough     choices of faith these women made, and you will be encouraged   to do the same     as you rely on the God: who accomplishes His purposes through   people who trust     Him.",

He is the perfect candidate to become the world's next supervillain.   That is why he ends up at H.I.V.E., handpicked to become a member of the incoming class. The students have been kidnapped and brought to a secluded island inside a seemingly active volcano, where the school has resided for decades.

Inside the cavernous marble rooms, floodlit hangars, and steel doors, the students are enrolled in Villainy Studies and Stealth and Evasion 101. But what Otto soon comes to realize is that this is a six-year program, and leaving is not an option.   With the help of his new friends: an athletic martial-arts expert; a world-famous, beautiful diamond thief; and a spunky computer genius -- the only other people who seem to want to leave -- can Otto achieve what has never been done before and break out of H.I.V.E.?",

        "Description": "Praise for Coming Together, Coming Apart\"\"Interesting conversation is Israel's most ingratiating commodity, and this is an especially interesting one. To read Coming Together, Coming Apart is to be engaged in an ongoing dialogue with one of Israel's most thoughtful observers--an American who made Israel his home, despite its imperfections and dangers. Gordis's conversational narrative is irresistible.\"\"--Alan dershowitz, author of The Case for Israel\"\"Whether describing a walk through Jerusalem in snow, a hike in the desert, or a farewell family drive to the Gaza settlements, Gordis manages to capture the essential details that tell us the larger meaning of our Israeli lives. There is much irony in this book, and also anger, especially against those who unfairly judge Israel in its most desperate and noble times. Most of all, though, this book is the chronicle of a love story--of an immigrant family in Jerusalem falling in love with Israel and, through that love, discovering the strength to cope with life on the front lines of a jihadist war. As a fellow Jerusalemite, I feel a profound debt to Gordis for explaining what it means to raise a family in the middle of a terror zone, and the courage that average Israelis instinctively display in maintaining the pretense of normal life. Those of us who share his passion are fortunate to be so well represented by this book.\"\"--Yossi Klein Halevi, Foreign Correspondent, The New Republic",

        "Description": "Born in Poland in 1810, Chopin emigrated to Vienna at age eighteen&#151;and then to Paris, where from 1831 to 1849 he would spend almost half of his brief and tumultuous life. In Paris his extraordinary powers would reach their height and he would shine among the immensely talented writers, painters, and musicians who were working there and defining their era. Chopin&#39;s other acquaintances ranged from Rothschild to Marx&#151;and it was here that he began his long and stormy relationship with the novelist George Sand. In Chopin in Paris&#151;a New York Times Notable Book&#151;Tad Szulc brings to life this complex, contradictory genius, and re-creates an unsurpassed epoch of European history, culture, and music.",

        "Description": "Tall, striking, and adventurous to a fault, young British relief worker Emma McCune came to Sudan determined to make a difference in a country decimated by the longest-running civil war in Africa.  She became a near legend in the bullet-scarred, famine-ridden country, but her eventual marriage to a rebel warlord made international headlines\u2014and spelled disastrous consequences for her ideals. Enriched by Deborah Scroggins\u2019s firsthand experience as an award-winning journalist in Sudan, this unforgettable account of Emma McCune\u2019s tragically short life also provides an up-close look at the volatile politics in the region.  It\u2019s a world where international aid fuels armies as well as the starving population, and where the northern-based Islamic government\u2014with ties to Osama bin Laden\u2014is locked in a war with the Christian and pagan south over religion, oil and slaves.  Tying together these vastly disparate forces as well as Emma\u2019s own role in the problems of the region, Emma\u2019s War is at once a disturbing love story and a fascinating exploration of the moral quandaries behind humanitarian aid.",
