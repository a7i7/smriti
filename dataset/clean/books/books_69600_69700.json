        "Description": "Born in West Belfast in 1948 into a family with close ties to both the trade union and republican movements, Gerry Adams is the eldest of ten children. He writes with affection of his mother, \"an articulate and gentle woman,\" of his father, a republican activist who had been jailed at the age of sixteen, and of his grandmother, who nurtured in him a love of reading.He describes his childhood, despite its material poverty, in glowing and humorous terms, recollecting golden hours spent playing on the slopes of the mountain behind his home and celebrating the intimate sense of community in the tightly packed streets of working-class West Belfast.But even before leaving school to work as a barman, he had become aware of the inequities and inequalities of life in the north of Ireland. Soon he was engaged in direct action on the issues of housing, unemployment, and civil rights.Gerry Adams brings a unique perspective to the years of conflict, insurrection, and bitter struggle that ensued when, in his view, peaceful political agitation was met with hysterical reaction, and the sectarian tinder-box of Britain's last colony erupted. From the pogroms of 1969 to the hunger strikes of 1981, from the streets of West Belfast to the cages of Long Kesh, this powerful memoir is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand modern Ireland.",

It was a place famously founded by FDR, \"a perfect setting in time and place and strangeness for a hospital of crippled children.\"There the young Shreve met Joey Buckley, a thirteen-year-old in a wheelchair who desperately wants to play football for Alabama. The shock of first love and of separation from her fiercely protective mother propels Shreve on a careening course from Warm Springs bad girl to overachieving saint and back again. This indelible portrait of the psychic fallout of childhood illness ends -- like Tobias Wolff's Old School -- with a shocking collision between adolescent drive and genteel institution.During Shreve's stay at Warm Springs, the Salk vaccine was developed, an event that put an end to a harrowing time for American families. Shreve's memoir is both a fascinating historical record of that time and an intensely felt story of childhood.",

Thankfully, in less than a week he will marry Faith Sheppard, the love of his life. But there is one minor issue -- Jayson's longtime best friend, Asha Mills. Not only is she gorgeous, but Asha and Jayson also used to be lovers. Concerned about Asha's intentions, Faith delivers an ultimatum to Jayson, forcing him to face the toughest decision of his life: Either Asha goes, or there will be no wedding.  Jayson reluctantly sets out to end the friendship but cannot bring himself to do it. When he lies to Faith and tells her Asha is out of the picture, he never expects Faith to learn his secret, but Faith bumps into Asha and, discovering the truth, decides to get even with Jayson for his betrayal. Meanwhile, Jayson still believes that things are as they should be and, a few days before the wedding, sets out to meet Faith at a hotel room where a surprise party is promised for her. Hoping to surprise his fianc\u00e9e with a gift of roses when he walks into the room, Jayson instead receives a horrible shock. When a videotape of that night's painful events surfaces, Jayson finally starts to unravel the web of lies that has been cast around him. Because it is not just Faith who has been harboring secrets from him; Asha is also turning out to be a very different woman from the one he fell in love with years ago.

        "Description": "Richard Clarke's dramatic statement to the grieving families during the 9/11 Commission hearings touched a raw nerve across America. Not only had our government failed to prevent the 2001 terrorist attacks, but it has proven itself, time and again, incapable of handling the majority of our most crucial national security issues, from Iraq to Katrina and beyond. This is not just a temporary failure of our current leadership\u2014it is a systemic problem, the result of a pattern of incompetence that must be understood, confronted, and prevented.Clarke's first book, the number one bestseller Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror, explained how the United States had stumbled into a struggle with violent Islamist extremists. Now, in Your Government Failed You, Clarke looks at why these unconscionable failures have continued and how America and the world can succeed against the terrorists. Yet Clarke also goes far beyond terrorism, to examine the inexcusable chain of recurring U.S. government disasters. Despite the lessons of Vietnam, there is Iraq. A trail of intelligence failures litters the Washington landscape. From Katrina to color codes and duct tape, \"homeland security\" has been an oxymoron. Why does the superpower continue to bobble national security?Clarke minces no words in his examination of the breadth and depth of the mediocrity, entropy, and collapse endemic in America's national security programs. In order for the United States to stop its string of strategic mistakes, we first need to understand why they happen. Drawing on his thirty years in the White House, Pentagon, State Department, and intelligence community, Clarke gives us a privileged, if horrifying, look into the debacle of government policies, discovering patterns in the failures and offering ways to stop the cycle once and for all.",

You will need to muster your determination, keep your wits about you, and focus on small details in order to complete more than 20 challenging mazes. Forget the boring labyrinths of puzzle books and cereal boxes, these intricate adventures are drawn with striking detail and are all based on historic events. Put yourself in these death-defying situations: * Find your way off the sinking Titanic onto the iceberg. * Descend ropes to escape the burning Hindenburg. * Find a clear tunnel passage to help Allied soldiers break out of the German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag Luft III. * Help the Dalai Lama avoid capture by Chinese communist troops. * Guide the crew of the Apollo 13 moon mission back to earth. * Determine whether it was possible to escape from the prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. As you wend your way from disaster and doom to safety and freedom, you will learn what the real people faced with these situations had to overcome, from rocky terrain, strong ocean currents, and the forces of nature to invading armies, impenetrable fences, and exploding torpedoes. Of course, unlike the historic adventurers, you will have the solutions to the mazes at your fingertips at the back of the book.  64 pages, 58 b/w illus., 8 1/4 x 11.",

In The Blessing of a Skinned Knee, author Wendy Mogel introduced a new approach to parenting, one that drew its fundamental principles from Jewish wisdom and emphasized resisting overprotection of our children. With its combination of insight and practicality, the book became a word-of-mouth success and made Mogel a much sought after speaker.  Now, in the long-awaited follow-up to her perennial seller, Mogel addresses the question she is asked most frequently: how to be a parent in a culture that breeds anxiety and fragility in older children and teens by placing too high a value on perfection and success. Applying concepts from mussar (a Jewish system of character refinement that focuses on ethical behavior) and other teachings, Mogel shows parents how to stop overindulging or pressuring their children and instead focus on developing sound judgment. By practicing composure, detachment, acceptance, moderation, integrity, authority, and delight\u2014the traits covered in the seven chapters\u2014parents will not only uncover an appreciative and reflective relationship with their children, but will also set an example of the adults they want them to become.   An important and inspiring book, The Blessing of a B Minus  encourages parents to see beyond the drama of teenage crises and the competitiveness of college applications to the goal of raising resilient, optimistic adults.",

        "Description": "Authoritative, comprehensive, practical, and up-to-date, this clearly written guide will help allergy sufferers find effective relief.Fifty million Americans suffer from allergies, an immune system reaction triggered by exposure to certain foods, chemicals, pollen, dander, and even common household dust. Although the common symptoms--red eyes, runny nose, hives--are not life-threatening for most people, they can make life miserable--so miserable that sufferers spend nearly $500 million per year on over-the-counter drugs that promise relief.Still other Americans suffer from asthma, which can be both uncomfortable and seriously debilitating, or from such severe allergic reactions that the sting of a bee or a shot of penicillin can cause anaphylactic shock, a potentially fatal condition.Written by two specialists in allergy medicine, Allergies will help both the seasonal sneezer and the chronic sufferer find the safest, most comfortable way to live with their allergy.The authors explain types of diagnostic tests and treatments, discuss the use of shots, prescription drugs, nasal antihistamines and corticosteroid sprays, and other treatments, and debunk the many myths that abound in a field fraught with quackery. What is more, they evaluate the most common over-the-counter drugs for safety and effectiveness. Useful, practical information is provided on how to minimize allergens like dust, mites, mold, and pollen in the home environment; how to exercise safely; and how to guard against \"trigger\" foods. Chapters cover occupational allergies (including the \"sick building syndrome\"), allergies and pregnancy, allergies and surgery, and the psychological aspects of allergies. A special section deals with allergies in children. Throughout, important preventive and cautionary advice is given for those at risk for serious asthma attacks and anaphylactic shock.Many allergy sufferers undergo and pay for extensive, expensive diagnostic and treatment methods that have little or no value. Allergies provides the information necessary to find effective self-treatment or proper medical help.",

He takes up football, and school, after a rich, white, Evangelical family plucks him from the streets. Then two great forces alter Oher: the family's love and the evolution of professional football into a game where the quarterback must be protected at any cost. Our protagonist becomes the priceless package of size, speed, and agility necessary to guard the quarterback's greatest vulnerability, his blind side.",

For decades she has been a sage, down-to-earth voice of reason to the millions who read her books and newspaper and magazine columns, and heed her advice on television and radio.Now, in her tenth book, Positive Plus: The Practical Plan for Liking Yourself Better, Dr. Brothers takes everything she has learned over the years and shapes this tried and true advice into a guide for the nineties, the decade of moderation. The subject here is change, subtle change. Are there traits about yourself that you hate, that you would like to alter? Are you too shy, too bossy, too jealous? Do you nag too much? Do you seek perfection where mere excellence would suffice? Do you overspend to compensate for feeling underloved?Dr. Brothers demonstrates how these and other negative personality traits can be shaped into positives. She helps readers evaluate whether change is really necessary and, if so, presents a pathway to achieving reasonable improvement.The basis of her plan lies in making small but effective behavioral shifts in the way we respond to others and ourselves. Addressing a wide range of self-destructive tendencies, Dr. Brothers explains what is normal and what is extreme, and outlines a step-by-step method for improvement.The key to change lies in a \"Psychological Tool Kit,\" a collection of behavior modification techniques Dr. Brothers has found simple and effective. She encourages readers to set realistic goals, map out strategies for improvement, and reinforce positive acts. She also suggests ways to handle excessive stress and life's accidents, those events in which even the most solid improvements go astray.Positive Plus is a commonsense, rational, relatively painless way to feel good about yourself.
