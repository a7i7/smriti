        "Authors": "By Trafford, Abigail",
        "Description": "Kids grown? Mortgage paid? Career topping out? What now? In My Time, best-selling author Abigail Trafford answers the questions more and more 50-somethings are asking themselves. Thanks to the longevity revolution of recent decades, today's 55- to75-year-olds are living and working longer and healthier than ever before. This generation is the first to experience the period of personal renaissance in between middle and old age-what Trafford calls \"My Time.\" Defining this period as a whole new developmental stage in the life cycle, Trafford skillfully guides readers through the obstacles of My Time and offers them the opportunity to take full advantage of the bonus decades. With the same wit, compassion, and vivid storytelling that made Crazy Time one of the best-loved books ever written on the subject of divorce, Trafford blends personal stories with expert opinions and the latest research on adult development. From the psychoanalyst who gave up his practice to write self-help books, to the widowed mother of three who reinvented herself as a successful photographer, true tales of crisis and triumph sparkle on every page of this inspiring and insightful book. Like Gail Sheehy's Passages, My Time profoundly impacts the journey through our adult years.",

        "Description": "Dream ManMarlie Keen was trying to lead a quiet, ordinary life. She thought the clairvoyance that allowed her to witness crimes as they happened had been destroyed in the nightmare of her past. Then one night it returned with a vengeance, and she desperately needed to find someone to make it stop.Detective Dane Hollister of the Orlando police department had never met anyone like Marlie. He had doubts about her clairvoyance, but there was no doubt how much he desired her. Her soft, sweet scent set his blood afire, and he wanted to wrap her in his arms and chase the sadness from her eyes. To Marlie, Dane was all heat and hard muscle, and he made her body come alive as it never had before. But not even she could foresee where their passion would lead: a hungry quest for the elusive, dreamy ecstasies of love...and a dangerous journey into the twisted mind of a madman who would threaten their happiness and their lives....After the Night A poor, outcast child in Prescott, Louisiana, Faith Devlin had always adored the town's golden boy from afar. But he called her white trash that sultry Southern night when his rich, respected father disappeared, along with her pretty mom. Now Faith wanted to hate Gray Rouillard...not to feel a powerful surge of desire. But she couldn't quench her passion, any more than she could hide the truth about the past she had waited so long to unravel.Even when he raised hell, Gray Rouillard did it with style. Reckless, charming, and backed by Rouillard money, Gray controlled the town of Prescott -- and Devlin was a name he never wanted to hear again. But when he gazed at Faith Devlin, all he saw was a swirl of tangled sheets and her silken flesh beneath him. To care for her was impossible, unthinkable...because Gray Rouillard planned to use all his power to ruin her.",

        "Description": "Fusing travelogue, historical inquiry, and interviews with Iranians from all walks of life, Neither East Nor West is a landmark contribution to travel writing and to cultural studies, as well as a timely illumination of a nation deeply misunderstood by most Westerners. In describing life in Iran today, Christiane Bird, an American who spent part of her childhood there, breaks the silence that has surrounded Iran's culture -- unlike its politics -- for nearly twenty years.  Traveling alone and largely by bus, Bird journeys from the modern, bustling capital of Tehran to the medieval holy city of Qom, from the sacred pilgrimage site of Mashhad -- visited by more than twelve million Shi'ites annually -- to the isolated valley of Alamut, once home to the legendary cult of the Assassins. She visits mosques, public baths, Khomeini's former home, and a Caspian Sea resort, and attends prayer meetings and a horse racing meet. Along the way, she talks to muleteers and ayatollahs, Kurds and Turkomans, Westernized and traditional Iranians -- many of whom invite her home for a cup of tea.  The result is an astounding, insightful journey into the Islamic Republic of Iran -- in all its beauty, ferocity, and contradiction.",

        "Description": "What does the fossil record really tell us about the evolution and extinction of dinosaurs? What was the dinosaurs' exact relationship to the rest of the organic world? And what do they disclose about our own place in the history of life?Paleontologists Mark A. Norell, Eugene S. Gaffney, and Lowell Dingus, the curators responsible for the American Museum of Natural History's new Halls of Dinosaurs, have made these questions central to the concept and design of their spectacular reinstallation and to Discovering Dinosaurs. Drawing on their extensive experience in the field and in the laboratory, and on the incredible resources of the Museum - the world's premier collection of dinosaur fossils and information - they give us an authentic, fantasy-free understanding of these remarkable animals and their position in the great diversity of life.The authors use photographs, original drawings, maps, charts, diagrams, and historical and contemporary narratives to answer all our questions, from the most basic to the most sophisticated, about the lives and characteristics of dinosaurs; to provide a complete picture of the most important skeletons exhibited in the Halls of Dinosaurs; and to assess the genealogical relationships among these animals, and between them and later species.In words and pictures, the history of each fossil's discovery, excavation, acquisition by the Museum, and reconstruction is woven together with the story of paleontology: the unraveling, over the past 150 years, of the evolutionary record, mostly by the intrepid paleontologists who scoured remote lands in search of evidence, in historic expeditions all over the world sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History.Discovering Dinosaurs is the story of one of the greatest of all scientific enterprises, an undertaking that, as the authors describe it, transports us simultaneously to the primeval past and to the frontiers of scientific investigation today.",

        "Description": "Sally Schneider was tired of doing what we all do\u2014separating foods into \"good\" and \"bad,\" into those we crave but can't have and those we can eat freely but don't especially want\u2014so she created A New Way To Cook.Her book is nothing short of revolutionary, a redefinition of healthy eating, where no food is taboo, where the pleasure principle is essential to well-being, where the concept of self-denial just doesn't exist.More than 600 lavishly illustrated recipes result in marvelous, vividly flavored foods. You'll find quintessential American favorites that taste every bit as good as the traditional \"full-tilt\" versions: macaroni and cheese, rosemary buttermilk biscuits, chocolate malted pudding. You'll find Italian polentas, risottos, focaccias, and pastas, all reinvented without the loss of a single drop of deliciousness. Asian flavors shine through in cold sesame noodles; mussels with lemongrass, ginger, and chiles; and curry-crusted shrimp. Even French food is no longer on the forbidden list, with country-style p\u00e2t\u00e9s and cassoulet.Hundreds of techniques, radical in their ultimate simplicty, make all the difference in the world: using chestnut puree in place of cream, butter, and pork fat in a duck liver mousse; extending the richness of flavored oils by boiling them with a little broth to dress starchy beans and grains; casserole-roasting baby back ribs to render them of fat, then lacquering them with a pungent maple glaze.Scores of flavor catalysts\u2014quickly made sauces, rubs, marinades, essences, and vinaigrettes\u2014add instant hits of flavor with little effort. Leek broth dresses pasta; chive oil becomes an instant sauce for broiled salmon; a smoky tea essence imparts a sweet, grilled flavor to steak; balsamic vinegar turns into a luscious dessert sauce. Variations and improvisations offer infiinite flexibility. Once you learn a basic recipe, it's simple to devise your own version for any part of the meal. \"Fried\" artichockes with crispy garlic and sage can be an hors d-oeuvre topped with shaved cheeses, part of a composed salad, or as a main course when tossed iwth pasta. It's equally happy on top of pizza or stirred into risotto. And by building dishes from simple elements, turning out complex meals doesn't have to be a complex affair.A wealth of tips and practical information to make you a more accomplished and self-confident cook: how to rescue ordinary olive oil to give it more flavor, how to make soups creamy without cream, how to freshen less-than-perfect fish.So here it is, 756 glorious pages of all the deliciousness and joy that food is meant to convey.",

Sensing their own neediness yet wanting to nurture their children's spirituality, they search their hearts and memories only to come up empty-handed. Now, for all these parents, Rabbi Wolpe offers a pathway into the tradition. In clear and welcoming language, he explains the important themes in Judaism and shows the many ways the religion can be passed on. Instructive and reassuring, his words offer invaluable insights into children's spiritual needs, enabling a parent to see again as a child, to understand children's fears, dreams, and hopes.",

        "Description": "As the Middle East has gone up in flames, no image so captured the clash of cultures as did the siege at the Church of the Nativity, where Christian monks were trapped inside the fortress-like church, as Palestinian gunmen faced off against the Israeli military for five weeks. As Muslim and Jew battled for control, the Christians were caught in the crossfire: endangered and largely forgotten, victims of somebody else's war. In The Body and the Blood, Charles M. Sennott examines the dwindling Christian communities of the modern Middle East in search of answers to the following questions: Why is Christianity dying out in the land where it began? And what are the consequences, not only for the future of Christianity but for the Middle East itself? From Israel to Lebanon to Egypt to Jordan to the ancient cities of the West Bank, Sennott finds that the themes resonating today are the same as those that convulsed the region at the time of Christ. His frontline reporting is powerful and provocative, as he shines a new light on the Middle East.",

        "Description": "A sassy and exuberant debut novel, Ruby River chronicles the courage and compromises of a newly widowed mother in a small Southern town in a masterful examination of family, marriage, and community.Warm, sensuous, and hailed as ?a triumph\u201d by The Lexington Herald-Leader, Ruby River drops us into a small town during a blistering Alabama summer where Hattie Bohannon has just opened a truck stop. A magnet for transients of questionable background and inclination, and run by Hattie\u2019s nubile daughters, the truck stop is an uneasy presence in Maridoches, where the population prides itself on their fixed family values and staunch, principled lifestyle. Crackling with the energy and spark of strong, colorful characters whose lives are continually colliding, Ruby River gathers heat and tension until it culminates in a conflagration of ideologies that is as poignant as it is comical, and as heartbreaking as it is hopeful.A widow whose husband\u2019s ashes have been lost by the Veteran\u2019s Association, Hattie exists in a limbo of unexpressed grief, trying to determine the contours of her self alone. At the same time, she must contend with the burgeoning sexuality of her strong-willed daughters, who are trying to forge their own place within their now fatherless family, and in the community at large. In a season of unrelenting heat, when caterpillar pods have infested all the trees, desire gestates and hovers over Maridoches, threatening the moral equilibrium of the small church town. When Hattie\u2019s oldest daughter, Jessamine, is falsely accused of prostitution, the Reverend conveniently declares war against the immorality of the Bohannons and their establishment, and what ensues is a clash of wills and values that will leave no one unaffected.Among the quirky residents of Maridoches are Sheriff Dodd, who pursues the ambivalent Hattie\u2019s affections, and then causes strife when his affections find another object in Jessamine; Reverend Peterson, whose magnetic wife?once his brilliant muse?is now the source of his chief frustration; Gert Guerin, a cook at the truck stop who believes it is her calling to save the souls of all those around her.Lynn Pruett deftly interweaves the struggles of Hattie, her daughters, and the surrounding community to create a tapestry of individuals desperately trying to deny the conflicting urges of flesh and spirit, progress and tradition. And flowing through the narrative, as well as the town of Maridoches itself, is the Ruby River, offering liberation for those seeking relief from the oppressive summer heat and their hawk-eyed neighbors, and inspiring irrational, overwhelming terror in those who despise what cannot be contained by neat boundaries. In the tradition of beloved contemporary writers such as Fannie Flagg and Rebecca Wells, Lynn Pruett\u2019s glorious tale?rich with the earthy wit and flavor of the south?captures the struggle for the very soul of a community suddenly forced to look at itself in a new light.",

Robert H. Waterman Jr., coauthor of the best-selling In Search of Excellence, shows how and what this sort of innovation must become a way of life for business organizations across the board. What is needed is an environment that fosters the use of an ad-hoc problem-solving technique, in effect an \"adhocracy\" that functions outside the often initiative-stifling bureaucracy.Drawing on twenty-five years' experience in management consulting, Waterman offers clear instructions on how to establish adhocracy and make it work: creating task forces and independent business units, even two people meeting in a hallway to solve a common problem. A lively and insightful work, this should become an essential handbook for managers at all levels who recognize the need to redefine the rules for success.",

        "Title": "Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Financial Plan",
        "Authors": "By Pollan, Stephen M. and Levine, Mark",
        "Description": "Exit Life as You Came in It: Penniless!And Other Heretical Hints For Living Well In The New Economic Age\"If you don't read this book, you're going to die stupid!\"-- Dr. Laura Schlessinger The Baby Boomers are a generation of achievers:  They earned college and professional degrees and are scampering up the corporate ladder or starting entrepreneurial enterprises that boost their egos and their bank accounts.  They buy sensible \"starter homes\" and plan to parley them into impressive dream houses through smart real estate deals, all the while deftly juggling their home, family and business lives.  If two incomes don't cover all life's necessities -- and necessary luxuries -- their credit cards serve as readily available genies to make wishes reality.  If their ultimate rewards have always been clear -- an early and comfortable retirement and a healthy estate to leave for the children -- why are they now facing the future with fear and trepidation?In Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Financial Plan \u00a0 (HarperBusiness; November 1997; $25.00), financial advisers Stephen M. Pollan and Mark Levine explain the economic realities that have rendered the old rules obsolete and offer an innovative approach to financial planning that focuses on getting the maximum use out of your income and your assets during your  lifetime and renouncing the foolish (and futile) quest for financial immortality.  From the startling recommendation, \"quit now,\" to the heretical \"die broke,\" Pollan lays out the details of a complete financial revolution.\"Viewing yourself and your work as one,\" Pollan writes, \"is a tremendous financial and emotional risk.\" To prove that the \"Self-Fulfillment Ethic\" and the false belief in careers must give way to a new work ethic, Pollan cites a ready role model -- the professional athlete.  Free agents in the sports world know their tenure with any team is temporary and concentrate on getting the best financial deal they can.  Adopting their attitude is the key for anyone who doesn't want to remain on the sidelines in the next century.  Pollan advises that work is not a holistic pursuit.  The only  way to increase satisfaction and/or income is to job hop with a constant eye toward a work setting that will increase skills (and therefore marketability) and improve quality of life with immediate advantages like premium health insurance, company day care, parental leave and telecommuting and flex time options.  \"Long term benefits, like pension plans,\" Pollan reminds readers, \"are worthless.  Most of you will be fired long before you are fully vested.\"  What else is keeping people locked in the 20th century?  Two little pieces of plastic:  ATM cards and credit cards.  The convenience is irresistible; the costs are mind-boggling.  Offering a strong dose of reality, Pollan insists that spending should be difficult and uncomfortable:  \"You must resolve to no longer reach beyond your grasp.  If you don't have the cash on hand or in your checking account to buy something... don't buy it.\"Pollan issues an equally important warning about the biggest purchase most people make in their lives -- real estate.  Home-ownership remains an excellent tax shelter and a desirable form of enforced savings that can help generate income in later years.  But with the unpredictability of the real estate market, the benefits of \"serial ownership,\" or \"trading up,\" have become less likely.  Pollan's solution is to save your money until you can \"buy your second home first,\" by purchasing a residence that is large enough to accommodate a growing family, aging parents and even a home business -- in short, a home designed for a lifetime.  Along with demanding a new perspective on work, credit and real estate, the new economic age lays to rest the American \"dream\" of retirement.  Not only are traditional sources of retirement money (government assistance and private pensions) drying up, but people have discovered that long-term leisure isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Pollan encourages readers to shift their viewpoint and think about earned income the way they've always thought about unearned income: It may grow, stagnate or decrease.  Investing and savings should be used to generate unearned income that will supplement on-going but fluctuating earnings.  Among his recommendations: Keep a liquid reserve (in Certificates of Deposit, for example), pile up tax free savings by taking full advantage of IRAs, Keoghs, SEPs or 401(k)s, stick with equity investments like stock mutual funds far longer than traditionalists recommend, insure your income with top-notch health and disability coverage and protect your family with term life insurance that gives them enough to get by so they can adjust to the loss of your income.  There's one last obstacle to living well now and in the future: the obsession with inheritance.  Like retirement, the desire to establish an estate is a hold-over from an earlier age and leads to unnecessary sacrifices that far outweigh any future benefits.  Asserting that \"every dollar that's left in your bank account after you die is a dollar wasted,\"  Pollan outlines a plan that enables you to die broke while guaranteeing that you don't out-live your assets.  His plan includes what kind of annuities to invest in for a maximum flow of income, the best ways to share your money with loved ones while you're still alive, how to get paid for living in your house and the ins-and-outs of Medicaid, Medigap, long-term care  insurance and other vehicles for covering expenses at the end of life1s journey.   Recognizing that accepting a theory is one thing and putting it into practice another, Pollan provides an invaluable examination of 63 different career and financial topics from the Die Broke\u00a0 perspective.  Throughout the book, Pollan specifies the optimum times to pursue various financial options, but stresses that it is possible to go back and accomplish most objectives before moving on to the next phase or to hold off on a step until you meet the criteria he discusses.  The good news is it's never too early and never too late to live well and DIE BROKE.",

Called \"Soldier\" by one and all, he is a man of honor and ability, responsible for keeping the peace, for maintaining the status quo...and, most important, for guarding the great Book House on the hill - a vast repository of Last Culture knowledge presided over by Libary, Soldier's mentor, the most senior of the mystic Celibate scholars. Such is Thomas's life in the serene, semi-primitive world without nations and cities and governments - until the night the starship comes home.Having fled a dangerously overcrowded Earth years before the Collapse and the Twilight that followed, for seven centuries the men and women of the space-going vessel Search have been combing the galaxy for inhabitable planets - their aging processes dramatically slowed by the relative magic of light speed travel and cryogenic sleep. And now, lonely and frustrated, the weary voyagers have returned to a homeworld unrecognizably altered by the relentless tides of time - a world that does not want them back.A bitter welcome awaits the Searchers, as old Libary gathers Earth's Ordinands and Elders together to tap the terrifying power of the collective unconscious - in preparation of the Carnival night when they will sweep the helpless intruders back to their lonely sky in the name of Holy Science. And it is Soldier who stands in the middle, silent and alone - bound by duty to evict the homesick star-travelers...yet cursed by a preordained genetic destiny that has decreed their eviction will mean Soldier's death.",

Having Everything is the story of a nighttime drive that leads Philip to jeopardize it all for a moment's flirtation with the forbidden. For on that drive he will collide with the Kizers -- beautiful, troubled Dixie and brilliant, kinky Hal. By stepping, without knocking, into the Kizers' house and into the midst of their sad marriage, Philip sets in motion the near ruin -- and perhaps the salvation -- of his entire world. Fierce, ironic, and beautifully told, Having Everything reminds us that sometimes -- in marriage, and in life -- having everything is not enough. \"A master of understated, ominous moments in a marriage in which not asking a question can be more disastrous than asking it.... Sharp, moving, poignant.\" -- Lev Raphael, The Washington Post Book World; \"John L'Heureux is perhaps today's most frightening novelist because his characters, for all their strange behavior, are not freaks or misfits. They are the people we see and know.... Having Everything is an unforgettable exploration of what it means to become fully human.\" -- Richard Wakefield, The Seattle Times; \"A master of spoof and irony.... As the book moves forward to a conclusion that readers will sense is going to be catastrophic, it is impossible to stop turning its pages.\" -- Carol Herman, The Washington Times",

This unique system has helped make the Best American series the most respected -- and most popular -- of its kind.Dave Eggers, who edits The Best American Nonrequired Reading annually, has once again chosen the best and least-expected contemporary fiction, nonfiction, satire, investigative reporting, alternative comics, and more from publications large, small, and on-line -- Zoetrope, Tin House, the Atlantic Monthly, Bomb, SPX, the New York Times, Texas Monthly, GQ, Iowa Review, Esquire, and others.
