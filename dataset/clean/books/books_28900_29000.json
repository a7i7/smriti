        "Description": "In fast-food society we long for quick fixes and easy answers. But no worthwhile goal is easily reached, and a deep spiritual life is not created in a week or two. It takes perseverance over the long haul to finish well.The Finishing Touch encourages you to keep on keeping on to reach your goals and reap the harvest of a life worth living.Charles Swindoll challenges today's I'm-getting-tired-so-let's-just-quit mentality. He says, \"Dieting is a discipline, so we stay fat. Finishing school is a hassle, so we bail out. Cultivating a close relationship is painful, so we back off. Working through conflicts in a marriage is a tiring struggle, so we walk away. Sticking with an occupation is tough, so we change jobs. . . . what we don't hear about is finishing well. About sticking with something until it is done.\"God wants to touch us and be our strength in the struggle. He wants us to finish what we started and complete the course.The Finishing Touch takes you through every day of a year, introducing you to God's touches of grace, joy, and love. As a sculptor applies himself to the marble, and keeps chipping and cutting away to reveal the masterpiece within, so the Master Artist wants to use our trials, hard times, and day-to-day struggles to chip away at our faults and to help us discover the potential treasures within us.Daily devotionals for fifty-two weeks help you discover gut-level authenticity, hope in the midst of despair, courage in the face of fear, the light of faith in the shadows of doubt, and peace in the midst of stress. Learn how God's touch on your life enables you to run the race to the finish?to the honor and glory of the Master who has called you to be more than you think you can be.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Book of English Detective Stories",
        "Authors": "By Craig, Patricia (EDT)",
        "Description": "The scene: a sleeping car on the North-Western express, somewhere between Preston and Carlisle.  The weapon: a small-caliber revolver.  The victims: two young newlyweds, with little money and no known enemies.  The puzzle: everyone in the car has an alibi, and no one was seen to leave. Here are all the ingredients for another gripping detective story.     The Oxford Book of English Detective Stories gathers 33 engrossing tales of crime, ranging from the birth of the genre to the present day.  Arthur Conan Doyle, G.K. Chesterton, Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Margery Allingham, P.D. James, Ruth Rendell, Robert Barnard, and Simon Brett--all the giants of English mystery are here, as well as Christianna Brand, Ngaio Marsh, Michael Innes, Reginald Hill, Nicholas Blake, Michael Underwood, and many more.  Editor Patricia Craig treats us to Sherlock Holmes, indefatigably tracking the details of the theft of Colonel Ross's prize horse, Silver Blaze, and the murder of its trainer.  In \"The Oracle of the Dog,\" G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown sits calmly in his study, solving at a distance the perplexing murder of Colonel Druce: was it the foreign Dr. Valentine, the foppish lawyer Traill, or Floyd, the exuberant American secretary?  P.D. James sends Chief Superindentant Dalgliesh on the trail of a mysterious death from some seventy years before--a case with a final, darkly ironic twist.  And Robert Barnard grimly lampoons English academe in \"The Oxford Way of Death.\"  In addition to this dazzling array of stories, Craig provides a concise introduction which surveys the origins and development of this enduring genre.     Ingenious, gothic, morbid, satirical--the English detective story ranks among the most dynamic and gripping fiction.  In The Oxford Book of English Detective Stories, Patricia Craig presents some of the best ever written, in an absorbing tour of the world of crime, detection, and retribution.",

She wondered, Can a Christian woman really lose her mind?A Joy I'd Never Known is Jan Dravecky's gripping story of her comeback from a devastating clinical depression. With unsettling candor, she offers a behind-the-scenes look at how God prepared the Draveckys for their ministry to the hurting by first leading them through their own dark, tear-filled valley.Jan's struggles and triumphs are played out not on a baseball diamond, but in hidden chambers of the soul, on a painful, sometimes terrifying journey from being a \"woman in control\" to a woman under God's control. It is a journey that winds from Jan's protected childhood through a series of tragic losses (including her husband's recurring cancer and eventual amputation), the downward spiral of depression, the lack of understanding from those around her, and finally, to hope, growth, and joy that came as she sought and found the help she needed. Along the way, Jan sheds some much-needed light on mental illness and the importance of a balanced, surrendered lifestyle.",

Now, responding to requests for more as well as to a number of recent exciting discoveries in physics and astronomy, Krauss takes a provocative look at how the laws of physics relate to notions from our popular culture -- not only Star Trek, but other films, shows, and popular lore -- from Independence Day to Star Wars to The X-Files. What&#39;s the difference between a flying saucer and a flying pretzel?Why didn&#39;t the aliens in Independence Day have to bother invading Earth to destroy it?What&#39;s new with warp drives?What&#39;s the most likely scenario for doomsday?Are ESP and telekinesis impossible?What do clairvoyance and time travel have in common?How might quantum mechanics ultimately affect the fate of life in the universe?",

        "Title": "Edward Windsor Royal Enigma: The True Story of the 7th In Line to the British Throne",
        "Authors": "By Leigh, Wendy",
        "Description": "A source of endless public fascination, the British royal family garners headlines on an almost daily basis. Only one member has eluded intense scrutiny -- until now. When the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II of England, Prince Edward, announced on January 6 of this year that he would wed his longtime girlfriend, Sophie Rhys-Jones, the world took notice. The last of the Queen's children to marry, Edward has \"delighted\" his parents with the news. But Buckingham Palace has seen the other royal children's marriages end in divorce...will Edward's be the one that lasts?  His business card reads simply \"Edward Windsor, Television Producer.\" (He heads his own production company.) This surprisingly low-profile thirty-five-year-old royal has never been the focus of the scandals that keep his family in the news. However, many questions remain unanswered. Now, in this explosive and comprehensive new unauthorized biography, British-born biographer Wendy Leigh explores the questions that have swirled around Prince Edward since his birth, including:   What was the true nature of the relationship between Edward and his sister-in-law, Princess Diana? How did Diana really feel about Sophie Rhys-Jones -- and how does Sophie feel about Diana? What is Sophie really like, and why did it take five years for Edward and her to become engaged? What really made Edward give up the Royal Marines for a life in the theater? Is there any truth to the rumors about Edward's sexual orientation? What is the unsavory trait that Edward shares with an illustrious royal relative?   No matter how he chooses to live his life, neither he nor the world can escape the fact that Edward is simply not an ordinary person. His mother is one of the wealthiest women in the world. His oldest brother, Prince Charles, is heir to the throne. And his sister-in-law was Princess Diana, whose premature death sent the world into mourning. Edward Windsor, the working prince, is determined to be judged on his own merits. As his betrothed says, it will be \"business as usual\" after she becomes the wife of a prince. The world will be watching.",

We hear people in the frontlines of medicine tell us their story, and tell it in their own voices. In these pages, which are a joy to read, we find proof that medicine is, and always will be, both art and science.\"--Abraham Verghese, M.D., author of The Tennis Partner\"Big Doctoring is an extraordinarily compelling effort by a dedicated and idealistic physician -- who offers us, through the voices of his informants, a clearly written narrative that tells of a profession's contemporary challenges and difficulties. Here is documentary work of the most instructive and telling kind -- a nation's healers become witnesses and teachers for us readers.\"--Robert Coles, M.D.\"At a time when both doctors and patients in record numbers abhor the shadowy mass of gloomy economics and gruesome bureaucracy that has overtaken American medicine, Mullan shows us a path out of the darkness. And his is a desperately needed map, as physicins and nurses are now quitting in droves, tens of millions of Americans are losing their health insurance, and millions more, though insured, are forbidden treatments and primary care that could save their lives. Bravo!\"--Laurie Garrett, author of The Coming Plague and Betrayal of Trust",

Her daunting mother-in-law has moved the family to her Long Island estate to escape city germs. Her two sons, one of enlistment age, are developing alarming pacifist sympathies, and the flag-waving chauffeur is spreading rumors about them. Her teenage daughter is growing up too fast.But it's the doctor's correspondence from \"somewhere in France\" that most disturbs, with its frequent mention of the remarkable French nurse, Jeanne Prie.

And when his son is drafted and follows him to France, and when the nurse's audacious experiments involve her in controversy, the situation spins out of control, forever changing all their lives.Somewhere in France is a riveting tale of medical suspense, a portrait of a society in transition, and an affecting love story that explores the mysteries of trust and faith.",

        "Title": "Leading the Way: How Vietnam Veterans Rebuilt the U.S. Military: An Oral History",
        "Authors": "By Santoli, Al (EDT)",
        "Description": "Al Santoli's bestselling Everything We Had was a landmark book about the Vietnam War - hailed by the Chicago Sun-Times as \"oral history at its best\" and praised by soldiers and civilians alike as one of the most powerful, truthful accounts of that conflict. Now in Leading the Way, Santoli brings us a stunning oral history of the United States military from Vietnam through Desert Storm, and beyond. Leading the Way is a historic record of the rebuilding and reenergizing of America's armed forces, as told by the combat veterans who helped to bring it about.Fifty-six military professionals bring to life the most critical moments they have experienced in combat, from the Central Highlands of Vietnam to the air-strips of Panama and the deserts of Kuwait and Somalia. But just as riveting as their battle stories are their behind-the-scenes accounts of how confidence, discipline, and integrity were restored to the military after Vietnam by the work and example of its leaders. In Leading the Way, senior sergeants and officers tell their own stories in their own voices.General Charles (\"Chuck\") Horner was thrust as a young, untested Air Force captain into the Rolling Thunder mission over North Vietnam - and drew on his crucial experiences there when he served as Commanding General of the Central Command Air Forces during Desert Storm.Command Sergeant Major William Earl McCune fought in Vietnam as a draftee, then decided he didn't want to go back to the Chicago ghetto. He soldiered for the next twenty-six years, and enforced discipline for an inexperienced tank battalion in Saudi Arabia.General Alfred Gray worked to solve the drug problems and racial tensions that plagued the Marine Corps during the \"wilderness years\" after Vietnam. Later, with dedicated officers like Colonel Michael Wyly, Gray pioneered the revolutionary new Maneuver Warfare Doctrine that has helped to save Marines' lives.Commander Timothy Holden served on a frigate off the coast of Vietnam, then trained to become one of the elite Navy SEALs. His command of coastal special operations missions involving Navy SEALs in the Gulf War was crucial to the Allies' success.Colonel Wes Fox, a Marine private in Korea and recipient of the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, blasts the notion that technology alone won the Persian Gulf War and praises the intelligence of the soldiers and the judgment of their officers during the war.As compelling to read as it is far-reaching in its implications, Leading the Way reveals crucial truths about the heart and mind of America's military, a military which now faces new challenges in a world torn by ethnic violence and regional instability. Anyone who cares about the recent past, the present, and the future of our armed forces will find Leading the Way essential, and fascinating, reading.",

        "Authors": "By Kellerman, Faye",
        "Description": "Called to investigate the shocking murder of a local high school's prom queen, detective Peter Decker confronts an expecially exotic subculture: the rootless, affluent, sometimes violent teenagers of Southern California. As the father of a nineteen-year-old daughter, Decker must deal not only with the brutality of the killing but with his own parental terror. When a disturbed young man with a mysterious history is identified as the prime suspect, everyone is relieved - except for Decker, whose professionalism and integrity lead him to startling and controversial conclusions.",

        "Description": "In this book, O. J. Simpson speaks out for the first time since his arrest for the deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in June of 1994. I Want To Tell You is an emotional and factual self-portrait of O. J.'s mind at this critical time.As O. J. waits to be judged by a jury of his peers, his commentary, thoughts, and reflections are juxtaposed with letters selected from the more than 300,000 he has received from people across the United States, since being incarcerated at the Los Angeles County Jail.At last, and in his own words, O. J. talks about: his innocence, his life with Nicole Brown Simpson, his kids, the Media, the Judicial System, spousal abuse, religion, and racism.Here is the real O. J. Simpson, the human side of the athlete and public figure who was an American icon long before the events of last June brought him under the scrutiny of the public eye. Today O. J. sits, confined to a five-by-eight-foot jail cell, a man deprived of his most basic freedoms, awaiting his trial and the future.",
