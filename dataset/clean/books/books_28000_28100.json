From the heart of the secretive Islamic kingdom's urban centers to its most remote mountainous terrain, from the homes of royalty to the slums of its poorest inhabitants, he provides intimate details and reveals underlying regional, religious, and tribal rivalries. Bradley highlights tensions generated by social change, focuses on the educational system, the increasing restlessness of Saudi youth faced with limited opportunities for cultural and political expression, and the predicament of Saudi women seeking opportunities but facing constraints. What are the implications for the Sauds and the West? This book offers a startling look at the present predicament and a troubling view of the future.",

        "Description": "More than a program for living with diabetes, here is a groundbreaking approach to preventing, treating, and even reversing an American epidemic, based on the science of the doctor who invented the low-carb lifestyle and wrote the #1 New York Times bestseller Dr. Atkins\u2019 New Diet Revolution featuring the Atkins Nutritional Approach\u2122\u2014 a celebrity-favorite diet perfect for losing weight before your wedding or to bounce back into shape post-baby, or if you just want to look and feel your best.The statistics are staggering. Thirteen million Americans have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes; another 5.2 million don&#39;t know that they have it. During the past thirty years the diabetes rate has tripled, and each year about 200,000 people die from complications of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control project that one out of every three children born in the year 2000 will develop the disease. But Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable. Find out how you can avoid becoming a statistic.As a respected physician and pioneer in the field of complementary medicine, Dr. Robert C. Atkins recognized early on that diabetes and obesity are twin epidemics, and that the way to reverse both is to permanently change the way people eat. Yet much of the mainstream medical establishment continues to advocate the treatment of diabetes with insulin and other drugs, while recommending a diet high in carbohydrates including sugar, which raises your blood sugar. What you&#39;ll learn from reading Atkins Diabetes Revolution is that rather than correcting your metabolism, such a diet can actually increase your risk of developing diabetes\u2014and heart disease.The Atkins Blood Sugar Control Program (ABSCP) helps you identify the metabolic signposts that indicate trouble long before the onset of Type 2 diabetes so you can stop it in its tracks. If you already have the disease, the ABSCP offers you and your physician a strategy for weight management and blood-sugar control, while minimizing your exposure to drugs.Atkins Diabetes Revolution presents a comprehensive lifestyle program, including diet, exercise, and nutrient supplementation. The book also contains meal plans, recipes, a fitness routine, and case studies. This revolutionary book, a fitting tribute to Dr. Atkins, tackles one of the greatest health challenges you and your family may ever face.",

As a district attorney, private lawyer, and judge herself, she saw firsthand how the U.S. justice system worked \u2013 and didn\u2019t.  One of the most respected legal journalists and commentators today, she now confronts a profoundly unfair legal system that produces results and profits for the few \u2013 and paralysis, frustration, and injustice for the many. Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s dire prediction in Democracy in America has come true: We Americans have ceded our responsibility as citizens to resolve the problems of society to \"legal authorities\" \u2013 and with it our democratic freedoms.The Case Against Lawyers is both an angry indictment and an eloquent plea for a return to common sense.  It decries a system of laws so complex even the enforcers \u2013 such as the IRS \u2013 cannot understand them.  It unmasks a litigation-crazed society where billion-dollar judgments mostly line the pockets of personal injury lawyers.  It deplores the stupidity of a system of liability that leads to such results as a label on a stroller that warns, \u201cRemove child before folding.\u201d  It indicts a criminal justice system that puts minor drug offenders away for life yet allows celebrity murderers to walk free.  And it excoriates the sheer corruption of the iron triangle of lawyers, bureaucrats, and politicians who profit mightily from all this inefficiency, injustice, and abuse.The Case Against Lawyers will make readers hopping mad.  And it will make them realize that the only response can be to demand change.  Now.",

They talk about what they have always talked about, only they go deeper and more honest: with outrageous humor they try to mitigate pain. Intimate and uncensored sharing, the kind of connection women prize, is at the heart of this deeply moving novel about the grit and power of female friends.Ann and Ruth have always talked as only great friends can--honestly, and about everything: husbands and marriages, sex lives and children, their work, their hopes, their disappointments, and their dreams. For Ann, cautious and conventional, her closeness to the outspoken and eccentric Ruth brings about discovery and liberation, a chance to say whatever she wants, and, most important, under the insistent tutelage of Ruth, to become herself. Over the years, the women have shared recipes, quilting patterns, child care, delicate and dangerous secrets. Each rests secure in the knowledge that they will be friends forever. Then something happens that will change their lives forever, and the women begin to share something more profound than either of them might have predicted.Written with an unerring ear for how women talk, laugh, and cry together, and with a gift for capturing the uniqueness of personality, Talk Before Sleep is sure to find a place in readers' hearts.",

        "Authors": "By Adams, Noah",
        "Description": "With his sharp eye and gentle wit, Noah Adams doesn't just tell stories, he lets them unfold quietly, powerfully, and eloquently. Now the beloved host of NPR's All Things Considered and bestselling author of Piano Lessons takes us on a river journey through the heart of Appalachia--a journey shared by pioneers and preachers, white-water daredevils, bluegrass musicians, and an unforgettable cast of vivid historical characters.Noah Adams has Appalachia in his blood. A native of eastern Kentucky, he comes to the headwaters of the New River not just in search of adventure but to better understand his own unique heritage. Following the New River from its mile-high source on North Carolina's Snake Mountain to its West Virginia mouth, Adams travels by Jeep and by bicycle, by foot and, most thrillingly, by white-water raft to explore the history, natural beauty, and fascinating characters waiting around every bend and turn. Distilling history from legend, Adams tells of men and women whose lives crossed the New River before him: Daniel Boone, fleeing his farming family in search of wilderness; Cherokee Indians driven west on their Trail of Tears; and the ill-fated men who traveled thousands of miles to work on the Hawk's Nest Tunnel, making a fortune for a company while their lungs filled with deadly silica dust. And along the way Adams follows the echoes of his own distant heritage, interweaving his river journey through Appalachia with yet another voyage, thousands of miles away.With eloquence and compassion, Noah Adams paints a luminous portrait of a land and a people as richly vital and complex as America itself. At the same time, his quietly personal chronicle captures the sheer magic of the flowing waters: their sound, their eddies, their utter unpredictability. A vibrant and unforgettable read, Far Appalachia mesmerizes and haunts like the bluegrass music that still rings through the mountains and valleys in which it was born.",

At the heart of this beguiling novel are two sisters\u2014one flamboyant and mischievous, the other shy and full of dreams\u2014bound by an extraordinary friendship who will be torn apart by their love of radically different men. Selima Edib, the aristocratic wife of the sultan's first secretary, bequeaths to her daughter Halide her passionate spirit and her gift\u2014a power nursed within the family for generations, passed on from mother to daughter, and never revealed to outsiders: the power to see and commune with the spirits of the dead. Halide's gift leaves her torn between the spiritual, tradition-bound world of her grandmother and the intellectual world of her father, a deeply conflicted man who defies the sultan's edict to give his daughter the education of a Western woman, despite his loyalty to the regime. As the story unfolds, Sultan Abdul Hamid plots, through his spies and informers, to crush the increasingly vocal opposition, leaving Halide and her sister, Mahmoure, on either side of a dangerous political divide.",

        "Description": "It's one of the toughest choices a mother will ever make: to \"work\" or be a full-time mother? It is also a long-running debate between moms who feel they contribute more to society at work than at home and those who feel mothering is not just a full-time job but a calling. In this newly repackaged, expanded, and updated edition of Home by Choice, national authority Dr. Brenda Hunter brings research to the discussion table, arguing that no one can replace the care a mother provides. As kids grow up with parental presence, she says, they develop a sense of home that will serve them all their lives. Dr. Hunter speaks directly to moms, addressing their unique concerns-such as financial pressure, support from husbands, and personal fulfillment. She makes a well-reasoned case for the enduring effects of a mother's love.From the Trade Paperback edition.",

Rather than viewing Jerusalem trough a political, religious, or missionary lens, the photographs chronicle everything from archeological digs to the ordinary people of the city going about their daily business. The photographs and accompanying text of Jerusalem: Caught in timeprovide a remarkable window into the Jerusalem of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and reveal the true face of the city and its people.",

There was no way he could beat Sonny Liston. So he went out and beat Sonny Liston. There was no way he'd give up his title. So as an act of principle, he gave up the heavyweight championship of the world. He beat George Foreman, when everyone knew he couldn't. He won the heavyweight crown for a third time, against Leon Spinks, when he was too old to win. Each time the world thought Ali was out of miracles, he performed another miracle. That's Muhammad Ali, In Perspective. And what you had in Atlanta was a wonderful reaffirmation of just how much Muhammad Ali means to the world. Three billion people were watching. Three billion people were in love with one man. Three billion people, even if it was just for a moment, had all the hate and petty prejudices removed from their hearts, and felt nothing but love.

        "Title": "Neuronal Man: The Biology of Mind",
        "Authors": "By Changeux, Jean-Pierre",
        "Description": "Jean-Pierre Changeux is a world-famous neurobiologist.  In an era of specialization, he is one of the rare scientists who has not only disregarded interdisciplinary boundaries, but in fact bridged them.  Published originally in France, where it was a runaway bestseller, his Neuronal Man is the most wide-ranging and in-depth synthesis of our current knowledge about the human brain-a balance sheet of 20 years' worth of discoveries as revolutionary as those in atomic physics at the turn of the century or genetics in the fifties.  More than a guided tour of the fabulous universe of the human brain, the book presents the author's radical, groundbreaking hypothesis currently shaking up scientific circles: that there is no \"mind\" in man, nothing psychic, only neurons, synapses, electricity, and chemistry.  The human cerebral cortex alone (the \"rind\" of the brain whose evolution culminates in man) contains at least 30 billion neurons (nerve cells).  As Changeux explains, these communicate with each other at the level of gaps call synapses, which are so numerous that \"if one counted a thousand of them each second, between 3,000 and 30,000 years would pass before they had all been numbered.  Changeux leads us through this complexity with clarity, elegance of style, wit, and rigor, and then, moving from this solid, factual base, allows us to see the reasoning behind his theory of the biology of the brain.  Neither \"reductionist\" nor \"holistic,\" that is, neither reducing the functioning of the whole to that of its elements, nor seeing a whole that more than the sum of its parts, this method is global, systematic.  Each element of the human system contributes to its functioning as a whole, which, in turn, influences the characteristics and development of each element.  The accent is on relations and interdependencies.  At once historical and didactic, scientific and philosophical, witty and shrewd, the story he tells is an exciting one of territorial struggles, conflicts of schools, retrogressions, and breakthroughs.  We explore a wealth of fact, theory, lore, and speculation, which sets into relief the development of our current knowledge of how the brain works.  Neuronal Man, a brilliant and controversial book, allows us to reconquer our internal space on the basis of a new logic. It bridges the gap between the biological and the social, between body, mind, and soul.  \"Science writing of the best kind, clear, concise, scholarly, at times even poetic.\"--Library Journal  \u00b7\"Written with great clarity, verve and grace, this detailed report...leads the reader carefully through the intricacies of an emerging science still in its infancy.\"--Publishers Weekly  \u00b7\"Pivotal....What [Changeux] says in this book may have far-reaching effects for years to come.\"-Booklist  \u00b7\"A revolutionary book.-L'Express  \u00b7\"Neuronal Man is an event as well as a book....A thrilling exploration of the brain and the mechanisms that control our behavior.\"--Liberation",

        "Authors": "By Shreve, Susan Richards",
        "Description": "With The Train Home, Susan Richards Shreve departs from the sweep of her previous novel, the acclaimed Daughters of the New World, to tell a poignant story of love, unlikely and triumphant.Two people meet by chance on a Washington subway. Annie Blakemore, an aspiring opera singer with a romantic imagination, two delightful children, and a husband made bitter and abusive by an automobile accident, becomes obsessed with a handsome priest she sees on the train. Knowing that her pursuit of a stranger is irrational, but intuiting that there is something right about it too, Annie follows him, little realizing that he is not what he seems. For Will Huston is not a priest at all, but an Irish actor in disguise, out to find and punish the man responsible for his young brother's death. As their paths cross, we begin to realize that, impossible as it may seem, their futures lie in each other.The Train Home is a novel that celebrates the magic inherent in the brief encounter and, if the disguises fall away, the possibility for love in a difficult world. It is a touching and beautiful work by an extraordinary writer who has that rare and special ability to keep us spellbound by the wonder of a marvelous story.",
