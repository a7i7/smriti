Since the no-nonsense literary detective from Swindon made her debut, literature has never been quite the same. Neither have nursery rhymes, for that matter. With two successful books of the Nursery Crime series under his belt, Fforde takes up once again the brilliant adventures of his signature creation in the highly anticipated fifth installment of the Thursday Next series. And it\u2019s better than ever.  It\u2019s been fourteen years since Thursday pegged out at the 1988 SuperHoop, and Friday is now a difficult sixteen year old. However, Thursday\u2019s got bigger problems. Sherlock Holmes is killed at the Rheinback Falls and his series is stopped in its tracks. And before this can be corrected, Miss Marple dies suddenly in a car accident, bringing her series to a close as well. When Thursday receives a death threat clearly intended for her written self, she realizes what\u2019s going on\u2014there is a serial killer on the loose in the Bookworld. And that\u2019s not all\u2014The Goliath Corporation is trying to deregulate book travel. Naturally, Thursday must travel to the outer limits of acceptable narrative possibilities to triumph against increasing odds.  Packed with word play, bizarre and entertaining subplots, and old-fashioned suspense, Thursday\u2019s return is sure to be celebrated by Jasper\u2019s fanatical fans and the critics who have loved him since the beginning.",

        "Description": "The founder and CEO of Siebel Systems, the world's leading provider of eBusiness software, reveals the eight principles of eBusiness that companies must master to succeed in today's economy.How is IBM, one of the world's most complex business organizations, tying its many operations together to gain a unified view of its customers and present a unified view to its customers? How does Marriott International achieve its exceptional focus on guest satisfaction resulting in occupancy rates dramatically higher than the competition? How is WorldCom transforming itself from a long-distance telephone company into a provider of total communications solutions?In Taking Care of eBusiness, Siebel System's founder, chairman, and CEO, Tom Siebel shows how these and other market leaders are applying information and communication technology to better understand and satisfy their customers. Thanks to today's eBusiness technology, organizations can conduct business in any way their customers want; anytime, anywhere, in any language and currency, and through any channel. In today's competitive climate, that ability, says Siebel, is no longer just an option; it is a matter of business survival.The age of eBusiness is in truth the age of the customer. Today's empowered customers are able to switch to the competition with unprecedented ease and speed. Nothing is more critical for business success, therefore, than delivering the highest levels of customer satisfaction. While companies must still compete on price, product quality, and distribution, those factors alone are not enough to gain a competitive edge: Only organizations that can consistently satisfy and even anticipate their customers' needs will win the escalating battle for customer loyalty.And Tom Siebel knows whereof he speaks. Siebel Systems is the world's leading provider of eBusiness applications software; the technology enabling many of the largest and best-known organizations to transform themselves into customer-focused eBusiness leaders. Based on his company's hands-on experience in implementing successful eBusiness systems, Siebel reveals  the eight essential principles of eBusiness, and outlines a straightforward, five-step process any company can use to become an effective eBusiness. Illustrated with detailed case studies that take an insider's look at the eBusiness strategies of companies such as Chase, Dow Chemical, Honeywell, Quick & Reilly, and others, Taking Care of eBusiness is nothing less than a manifesto for success in today's hypercompetitive marketplace.",

Now Lynne Levesque shows that creativity, like intelligences, exists in a variety of forms, and demonstrates that high-performance organizations need to make use of creativity in all its dimensions. It takes more than just \"thinking outside the box\" to build a flexible, adaptive organization that will survive competitive battles, grow and prosper, and provide the environment that attracts and keeps the best talent. On the basis of her research in personality, innovation and creativity, as well as her experience helping top executives achieve their full potential, Levesque describes eight distinct creative talents. People of each talent have a unique way of looking at challenges, collecting data and generating creative solutions. Breakthrough Creativity describes in individual chapters how each talent works, how each contributes to the creative process and how each can improve decision making, team building and strategic planning and thinking. Breakthrough Creativity brings to life the stories and rich experiences of working individuals around the world to help readers discover their own creative talents and use them to further their professional and personal lives.",

This book provides the language and operative principles and assessment models and sample coaching conversations  necessary to do that.The book is grounded in many different paths of wisdom including time-tested philosophies, sociological premises and psychological discussions. Chapter bibliographies encourage further interdisciplinary reading. \u00b7 This book is a coaching tool enabling the reader to become a business coach who can self-correct and self-generate your own innovations \u00b7 It addresses the question: How do I contribute to someone's competence in a respectful, dignified, effective way?",

        "Description": "Do you want more? More hope, more joy, more fun and more fulfillment? Change is the essence of life; the biggest, most meaningful, and dramatic differences in our lives\u2014and in our world\u2014are really just the result of a series of small, seemingly insignificant changes. \"Amazing changes can occur in the most surprisingly small amounts of time,\" says Allyson Lewis, author and senior executive at a major financial services firm. \"In just seven minutes my life changed forever, in this book I will share exactly what happened to me and how it can happen to you.\"In The Seven Minute Difference, Lewis motivates business professionals to grow through micro-actions that can be completed in as little as seven minutes. According to Lewis, small efforts such as two extra sales calls, a daily action plan, a review of a competitor\u2019s product, or a change of schedule can make the difference between mediocrity and excellence.This book coaches readers to realize their full potential by focusing on four fundamental truths: Change begins to happen the moment you decide to change ; you must want to change; you must expect change; you should enjoy the process of change. Drawing upon years of experience as a motivational speaker and financial advisor, Lewis shows how she has successfully used these principles to help thousands of corporate executives, financial advisors, insurance executives, entrepreneurs, accountants, and attorneys change their lives. Chapters are filled with concrete examples, anecdotes, and sage advice, such as \"Life is like luggage, there are limits to what you can take on the journey\" and \"If you want your life to be different, you must be different.\"With humor and flair, The Seven Minute Difference spurs people to unlock their purpose, knowledge, and passion, and as a result, transform their lives at work and at home.HighlightsAllyson Lewis inspires readers to:\u2022 Define a mission and action plan that will support change\u2022 Implement change and keep the momentum going\u2022 Paint the canvas of your life \u2013 map out your goals\u2022 Prioritize, organize, and simplify work and life to achieve greater productivity",

        "Description": "The only one-volume book you'll need to retrieve and improve the education you already have.\"I've Forgotten Everything I Learned in School!\" is no ordinary self-help book. Truly revolutionary in its construction, brilliant in its simple way of teaching skills, and imaginative in its presentation of a library of necessary information, it is a book that will be used both in the home and at school for years to come.If you're like most of us, the things you learned in school are receding further and further from your grasp, states Marilyn vos Savant, the popular Parade magazine columnist. But that does not mean this learning is lost forever. Without returning to the classroom, this book will help you reassemble the fragments of your education.In \"I've Forgotten Everything I Learned in School!\" vos Savant takes you into her own private classroom and shows you how to incorporate her secrets of understanding into your own daily learning process. She shows you how to look at problems and everyday events in new and mind-expanding ways, how to use logic and reasoning in a manner you never dreamed possible, and how to be truly creative - whether with your family or with the boss. As much a primer on the necessary information that you need to get through life as well as a book that imparts common sense through proven methodology, \"I've Forgotten Everything I Learned in School!\" gives you the confidence to ask questions that you never dared ask before, so that when a mechanic tells you that your car has \"vapor lock\" and that it will cost $500 to repair, you won't say \"fine\"; instead you will ask him what \"vapor lock,\" in fact, is.With sixteen individual \"books\" filled with vital information and dozens of clever quizzes, vos Savant presents a dual-purpose program that combines sixteen thinking skills and sixteen primary fields of knowledge, a comprehensive volume that takes you through all the basic learning techniques.\"I've Forgotten Everything I Learned in School!\" is Marilyn vos Savant's most inventive book yet, an entertaining resource volume that will be treasured by readers in the decades ahead.",

        "Title": "Inventing Al Gore: A Biography",
        "Authors": "By Turque, Bill",
        "Description": "Why did Al Gore, after angry opposition to the Vietnam War, submit to the draft? What happened in Vietnam that made him sullen and bitter? After renouncing politics, what set him back on the track mapped out for him? What made him claim (falsely) that he invented the Internet? How closely is he allied with the tobacco industry? What is the real nature of his partnership with Bill Clinton? How was it altered by the Lewinsky affair?      \"Inventing Al Gore\" addresses these issues and more as it unveils the true motivations, ideals, and idiosyncracies of one of Washington's most inscrutable men. Bill Turque, who covered both of Gore's vice presidential campaigns and the Clinton White House, draws on extensive access to Gore's key advisers, friends, and family. He unmasks a man who in private can sing and dance to George Strait's music but in public measures every comment and gesture with legendary caution. As Turque details, Gore's great political albatross -- a lack of empathy -- was hatched during his lonely childhood as the product of ambitious political parents who groomed him for the presidency. Turque's keen analysis also uncovers the genesis of Gore's questionable fund-raising and of a political platform laden with worthy but emotionally safe planks such as bioethics, global warming, and the Internet. In addition, Inventing Al Gore illuminates how personal tragedies have shaped his political life and the remarkable influence that women, from his mother to Naomi Wolf, have had on his career.     \"Inventing Al Gore\" reveals Gore to be one of the most intelligent, idealistic men in Washington, yet one who is repeatedly prone to prevarication, exaggeration, and avoidance of hard issues. Turque offers a meticulously researched narrative filled with colorful, insightful details that sharpen the debate over whether Gore can outgrow his limitations and excel in the office he has prepared for all his life.",

What, exactly, is the good life? (And what does that even mean?)Picking up where his bestselling memoir left off\u2013having been saved by emergency surgery after nearly dying on a mountaintop in Chile\u2013Alda finds himself not only glad to be alive but searching for a way to squeeze the most juice out of his new life. Looking for a sense of meaning that would make this extra time count, he listens in on things he\u2019s heard himself saying in private and in public at critical points in his life\u2013from the turbulence of the sixties, to his first Broadway show, to the birth of his children, to the ache of September 11, and beyond. Reflecting on the transitions in his life and in all our lives, he notices that \u201cdoorways are where the truth is told,\u201d and wonders if there\u2019s one thing\u2013art, activism, family, money, fame\u2013that could lead to a \u201clife of meaning.\u201dIn a book that is candid, wise, and as questioning as it is incisive, Alda amuses and moves us with his unique and hilarious meditations on questions great and small. Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself is another superb Alan Alda performance, as inspiring and entertaining as the man himself.",

They are committed to the most violent goals of Islamic jihad and united by the belief that God wants them to destroy America completely.While the federal government focuses on securing our borders and airports, it has virtually overlooked the challenge of rooting out the secret terror network already inside our borders. In fact, many of the most dangerous advocates of the holy war against America have been in the United States for decades - protected by organizations such as the ACLU, whose cry of \"Ethnic profiling!\" prevents entirely reasonable law-enforcement measures.Kushner's inside sources have supplied new evidence that federal agencies routinely allow suspected - and known - terrorists to slip through the cracks because they won't communicate with one another or because political correctness takes priority over counterterrorism efforts.",

        "Description": "A chilling, mesmerizing novel that combines the best of modern forensic thrillers with the detail and drama of historical fiction.  In medieval Cambridge, England, four children have been murdered. The crimes are immediately blamed on the town's Jewish community, taken as evidence that Jews sacrifice Christian children in blasphemous ceremonies. To save them from the rioting mob, the king places the  Cambridge Jews under his protection and hides them in a castle fortress. King Henry I is no friend of the Jews-or anyone, really-but he is invested in their fate. Without the taxes received from Jewish merchants, his treasuries would go bankrupt. Hoping scientific investigation will exonerate the Jews, Henry calls on his cousin the King of Sicily-whose subjects include the best medical experts in Europe-and asks for his finest \"master of the art of death,\" an early version of the medical examiner. The Italian doctor chosen for the task is a young prodigy from the University of Salerno. But her name is Adelia-the king has been sent a mistress of the art of death.  Adelia and her companions-Simon, a Jew, and Mansur, a Moor-travel to England to unravel the mystery of the Cambridge murders, which turn out to be the work of a serial killer, most likely one who has been on Crusade with the king. In a backward and superstitious country like England, Adelia must conceal her true identity as a doctor in order to avoid accusations of witchcraft. Along the way, she is assisted by Sir Rowley Picot, one of the king's tax collectors, a man with a personal stake in the investigation. Rowley may be a needed friend, or the fiend for whom they are searching. As Adelia's investigation takes her into Cambridge's shadowy river paths and behind the closed doors of its churches and nunneries, the hunt intensifies and the killer prepares to strike again . .",

        "Description": "From core concepts to current applications, Chemistry: The Practical Science promotes an interrogative approach that develops effective problem solvers and critical thinkers for today's world. Using the text and its pedagogical features as a model, students learn to appreciate the role of questioning in the process of chemistry and begin to think like chemists. In addition, applications woven throughout the narrative, examples, and exercises present core chemical concepts in the context of everyday life. This integrated approach encourages curiosity and demonstrates the relevance of chemistry and its uses in students' lives, their future careers, and their world.Chemistry introduces new topics as an instructor would in the classroom. The authors' approach to problem solving prompts students to begin by asking questions about the topic, think critically to arrive at a solution, evaluate their answers, and uncover related information about the concepts being explored. A dynamic art program, comprehensive end-of-chapter materials, and powerful technology resources complete this innovative textbook program.Real-world applications integrated throughout the chapter-opening case studies, examples, and exercises demonstrate why chemistry matters, as well as its uses in industry, the human body, and the environment. Boxed essays explore scientific applications; connections between nano-level interactions and chemistry at the macro level; and current, controversial topics related to chemistry. In addition, Applications Icons highlight Chemical Encounters and other real-world applications in the narrative.Sample worked-out exercises complement the authors' problem-solving approach and help students develop critical-thinking skills. Each exercise begins with a Question, followed by First Thoughts to capture and maintain student interest. The worked-out Solution, accompanied by Further Insights, extends the concept. Finally, Practice problems and corresponding End-of-Chapter Exercises provide an opportunity for students to apply this approach independently.Designed for optimal student support, Here's What We Know So Far in-chapter summaries reinforce complex or important chemical concepts, and The Bottom Line end-of-chapter reviews highlight the main topics of each chapter and provide key words with definitions and page references for further review.End-of-chapter problems test students' understanding of key concepts and problem-solving skills. Organized by chapter section and in pairs, Skills Review and Chemical Applications and Practices are followed by increasingly challenging Comprehensive Problems and Thinking Beyond the Calculation exercises that involve multiple concepts.The dynamic art program promotes visual learning and resonates with students who expect exciting and appealing graphics. Molecular-level illustrations of key concepts help students connect nanoscale activity to macroscale phenomena, while electrostatic potential maps use vibrant colors to demonstrate the distribution of electrons within a molecule. For further visual learning, the HM ClassPresent CD offers scaleable, searchable animations and lab demonstration videos for use in classroom presentations.The innovative technology program reinforces concepts and allows students to practice problem-solving strategies.

        "Description": "Millions of people with weight problems have discovered that all roads to successful weight loss do not begin with the low-fat diet. For most overweight people, in fact, a high-protein, low-carbohydrate plan is the preferred regimen to correct a metabolic imbalance, the source of the problem. While this eating plan runs counter to all the proscriptions of government nutritionists, it has proven to be not only a safe but also highly effective method of weight reduction and the basis for a lifetime of good health.Because turning to low-carb eating is like learning a new kitchen language, McCullough begins the book with an invaluable checklist of pantry essentials as well as creative substitutes for foods you may be missing (like mashed potatoes), and tradeoffs for those times when you do crave a carbo indulgence. The heart of the book, though, is the dozens of wonderful recipes for every course, from appetizers like a Mexican Shrimp Cocktail to an easy and extraordinary Cream of Mushroom Soup, from a Middle Eastern Lamb Salad to Nut-Crusted Swordfish, from vegetable dishes like Roasted Potato Skins and Zucchini \"Pasta\" to desserts like Berries with Trembling Cream and a made-in-moments Chocolate Mousse.",
