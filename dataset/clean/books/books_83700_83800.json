        "Title": "PGP: Pretty Good Privacy: Pretty Good Privacy",
        "Authors": "By Garfinkel, Simson",
        "Description": "Use of the Internet is expanding beyond anyone's expectations. As corporations, government offices, and ordinary citizens begin to rely on the information highway to conduct business, they are realizing how important it is to protect their communications -- both to keep them a secret from prying eyes and to ensure that they are not altered during transmission.   Encryption, which until recently was an esoteric field of  interest only to spies, the military, and a few academics,  provides a mechanism for doing this.PGP, which stands for Pretty Good Privacy, is a free and  widely available encryption program that lets you protect files and  electronic mail.  Written by Phil Zimmermann and released  in 1991, PGP works on virtually every platform and has become  very popular both in the U.S. and abroad.  Because it uses state-of-the-art public key cryptography, PGP can be used to authenticate messages, as well as keep them secret.  With PGP, you can digitally \"sign\" a message when you send it.  By checking the digital signature at the other end, the recipient can be sure that the message was not changed during transmission and that the message actually came from you.PGP offers a popular alternative to U.S. government initiatives like the Clipper Chip because, unlike Clipper, it does not allow the  government or any other outside agency access to your secret keys.PGP: Pretty Good Privacy by Simson Garfinkel is both a readable technical user's guide and a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at cryptography and privacy.  Part I, \"PGP Overview,\" introduces PGP and the cryptography that underlies it.  Part II, \"Cryptography History and Policy,\" describes the history of PGP -- its personalities, legal battles, and other intrigues; it also provides background on the battles over public key cryptography patents and the U.S. government export restrictions, and other aspects of the ongoing public debates about privacy and free speech.  Part III, \"Using PGP,\" describes how to use PGP:  protecting files and email, creating and using keys, signing messages, certifying and distributing keys, and using key servers. Part IV, \"Appendices,\" describes how to obtain PGP from Internet sites, how to install it on PCs, UNIX systems, and the Macintosh, and other background information.  The book also contains a glossary, a bibliography, and a handy reference card that summarizes all of the PGP commands, environment variables, and configuration variables.",

        "Description": "An invaluable source of Civil War facts, statistics, data, and trivia compiled from a wealth of histories, studies, accounts, and reminiscencesThis wide variety of lists includes detailed Civil War topics of every description. Commanders from both sides of the conflict are ranked according to the best and worst ever to lead troops during the war. A selection of casualty figures demonstrates the enormous number of lives taken on the fields of the war's bloodiest battles. The composition of the armies is given in terms of state origin, ethnic background, and even average height of the troops. Lists also probe social issues such as the distribution of the African American and White populations, the elections of 1860 and 1864, and the songs and poems sung in the North and the South. Lists of the best books available on the Civil War provide a pathway through the mountainous literature on the subject and offer a basis for further study. More frivolous lists detail unusual unit nicknames, delicacies made from hardtack, the ugliest generals, and generals killed in personal encounters.Over 300 informative lists of facts and trivia including:Best BrigadesBest RegimentsTen Best and Worst Commanded Battles of the WarTen Most Evenly Matched BattlesTop Turning Points of the WarState, Division, and Brigade Strengths and Losses at GettysburgBloodiest and Least Bloody BattlesRegiments with Greatest Total Casualties, Percentage Loss, and Battle DeathsGenerals Listed by West Point Class and RankRobert E.

        "Description": "The Children of Now is a groundbreaking work that shows that a large number of kids come into the world bearing inherent gifts that are beyond strange--they are telepathic, understand subtle energies, and/or have amazing psychic abilities. Many of them remember where they were before they came to Earth and often can describe past lives. Many doctors mislabel them as autistic, ADD, ADHD, or suggest other behavioral difficulties. More than half the time, these doctors are wrong. The Children of Now are not defective--they are differently functional. We are doing ourselves and the world a great disservice by not acknowledging these amazing children and their special gifts. A surprising percentage of these children carry within themselves wisdom far beyond most adults. The phenomenon is very real, and more and more of these highly evolved children enter our world every day.The Children of Now offers not only genuine stories of many children who have brought amazing talents into our world, but also practical, easy solutions to assist society in supporting and nurturing these gifted--not defective--children and their families, rather than labeling, segregating, and condemning them. Fascinating to anyone with an open mind, and life-illuminating for parents with these incredible kids, Meg offers detailed answers derived from counseling real kids in real families. The Children of Now is a must-read for every parent, teacher, caregiver, and child advocate. In it you'll discover: - Why our children's DNA is different from previous generations'. - The traits and needs of the Crystalline Children. - The Children of the Stars and why they are here. - Real stories of real children as Dr. Meg helps them and their families search for answers. - Why these kids are exhibiting telepathy, telekinesis, healing abilities, and more. - How to help the Children of Now at home, at school, and socially.",

        "Title": "Iran's Nuclear Option: Tehran's Quest for the Atom Bomb",
        "Authors": "By Venter, Al J.",
        "Description": "At a time when international terrorism is the focal point of our concerns, a far more pressing threat has arisen to the balance of power in the world and ultimately to the security of our country. Since the Islamic Republic of Iran admitted, just two years ago, that it was secretly producing highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium, leading nations have struggled to react in an appropriate manner. In this book, the U.S. public is able to learn, in full detail and for the first time, exactly what the Europeans and UN have been trying to forestall.In Iran we see a country, located at the center of the uraniumMiddle East, which could very shortly have the ability to strike its immediate neighbors and nations farther away with nuclear weapons. With the innate size to dominate its region, Iran is also a country with an avowed mission to export it's theocratic principles, and a nation which has, over the past 25 years, been a notorious supporter of terrorist organizations. Its parallel development of atomic bombs comprises the greatest threat that we have seen in the new millennium.In Iran's Nuclear Option, defense expert Al J. Venter details the extent to which Iran's weapons program has developed, and the clandestine manner in which its nuclear technology has been acquired. He demonstrates how Tehran has violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and details the involvement of several countries who have been shown by the IAEA to have trafficked in illegal nuclear materials. He proves, for the first time, a direct link between the now-defunct South African apartheid regime's nuclear program and Tehran's current nuclear ambitions. Venter digs deep into ancillary subjects, such as Iran's fervor on behalf of Shiite Islam, its missile program\u2014developed alongside its nuclear one\u2014and the role of the Pasdaran (Revolutionary Guards), whose tentacles have spread throughout the Middle East and increasingly further afield. While noting Tehran's support of terrorist groups such as Hizbollah, Venter follows closely how the Persian homeland itself has progressed toward a strategic nuclear capability that would make recent terrorist attacks look obsolete.Iran's Nuclear Option is essential reading for anyone with an interest in global security and the perilous volatility of the Middle East. It also comprises an indicator for America's own options, should it be willing to counter the threat while time remains, in favor of world peace rather than greater global instability.",

Pot pourri, made with colorful, fragrant plants and carefully selected herbs and spices, recreate evocative scents to remind us of Nature's fragrance.Carol Petelin, author of the successful The Creative Guide to Dried Flowers, has drawn on her wealth of experience to provide the ultimate guide to drying and using flowers, plants, and herbs in a myriad of creative ways. First, she describes plants that can be most successfully grown, even by those with limited garden space, and explains how to best harvest and dry them.The next section covers the art of dried flower arranging. There is advice on working with different combinations of color and form to create arrangements in containers, bouquets, posies, garlands, and swags. She tells how to gather and press flowers and herbs and offers a variety of imaginative projects for them.The final section is devoted to pot pourri. The author includes recipes for deliciously fragrant mixtures and describes how pot pourri, scented flowers, and spices can be used to make many delightfully fragranced items. There is a list of sources for herbs and essential oils.Lavishly illustrated throughout with Simon McBride's color photographs and decorated with some of Edith Holden's own drawings fromThe Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady and The Nature Notes of an Edwardian Lady, The Country Diary Book of Flowers will inspire all those who wish to practice the art of dried flower arranging and to make unusual and attractive gifts for their homes and friends.",
