But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer of awakening. By the glimmering waters of Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. And as the two built a new life together, Beata\u2019s past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler\u2019s terror threatens her life and family\u2014even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun.For Amadea, the convent is no refuge. As family and friends are swept away without a trace, Amadea is forced into hiding. Thus begins a harrowing journey of survival, as she escapes into the heart of the French Resistance.  Here Amadea will find a renewed sense of purpose, taking on the most daring missions behind enemy lines. And it is here, in the darkest moments of fear, that Amadea will feel her mother\u2019s loving strength\u2014and that of her mother\u2019s mother before her\u2013as the voices of lost loved ones echo powerfully in her heart. And here, amid the fires of war, Amadea will meet an extraordinary man, British secret agent Rupert Montgomery. In Colonel Montgomery, Amadea finds a man who will help her discover her place in an unbreakable chain between generations\u2026and between her lost family and her dreams for the future\u2014a future she is only just beginning to imagine: a future of hope rooted in the rich soil of the past.With the grace of a master storyteller, Danielle Steel breathes life into history, creating a bold, sweeping tale filled with unforgettable characters and breathtaking images\u2014from the elegant rituals of Europe\u2019s prewar aristocracy to the brutal desperation of Germany\u2019s death camps. Drawing us into a vanished world, Echoes weaves an intricate tapestry of a mother\u2019s love, a daughter\u2019s courage\u2026and the unwavering faith that sustained them\u2014even in history\u2019s darkest hour.From the Hardcover edition.",

To prevent further bloodshed, Murphy\u2019s friends at Troubleshooters scramble to find him and convince him to surrender peacefully.Murphy himself can\u2019t be sure what he did or didn\u2019t do during the years he spent mourning and lost in an alcohol-induced fog. He does know he occasionally sought solace from Hannah Whitfield, a former police officer and the very friend who\u2019d introduced him to his beloved late wife.But Hannah, still grappling with the deafness that resulted from an injury sustained while on duty, was fighting her own battles. For years Hannah had feelings for Murphy, and one painful night their suffering brought them together in a way neither expected\u2013and both regretted.Murphy is ready to rejoin the living. As always, he finds himself knocking on Hannah\u2019s door, and as always, his longtime friend welcomes him back into her home. Yet even as Murphy slowly rebuilds his splintered life, he continues to fight his growing feelings for Hannah. Then he learns of Ebersole\u2019s murder and comes to believe that the Freedom Network has targeted him\u2013and Hannah\u2013to avenge their leader\u2019s death to violence. Now Murphy must face the terrifying prospect of losing another woman he loves. As the Troubleshooters desperately search for him, Murphy races toward a deadly confrontation with the Freedom Network and ultimate choice: surrender his life in hopes that Hannah will be spared, or risk everything to salvage whatever future they may have together.",

You'll learn how to:Conduct targeted research to find suitable editors and agentsHook an editor with a tantalizing lead and shape a summary that compels editors to buySelect the strongest slant for your book or articleUse research and interview shortcuts that keep your query prep profitableMake your query rejection-proof by weeding out subtle mistakes that can sabotage your projectCommunicate your author platform and sell yourself as the best writer for the subjectComplete with dozens of sample queries&#150some that landed article assignments, agents, or book deals, and others that never stood a chance&#150this book offers you a comprehensive strategy for presenting your writing ideas in a way that will increase your chances of publication.

But that's only partially correct. One missing element in that approach is improvisation, an invaluable technique that can be used in acting classes and in rehearsals for school, amateur and professional productions.Most teachers and directors realize that value of improvisation as a regular part of their classes or rehearsals, but many find it difficult to come up with fresh ideas on a daily basis. The nine hundred improvisation ideas in this book should provide enough material to last for years.What the book includes can be applied to many theater situations. For example, there are many improvisation starters for character conflicts&#151;teen/parent, peer relationships, love relationships, co-workers, doctor/patient, brother/sister, and more; solo improvisations; physical positions (for one or two players); lines of dialogue; and reactions to environment. The author also has included a section suggesting a variety of improvisations for the production of Romeo and Juliet.",

Racing against the clock and facing enormous legal obstacles, Teresa, Chris, and Carlo desperately try to stay Rennell's execution, taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court, and to an enormously moving and powerful conclusion.",

At first reluctant to believe his father's fanciful tales, the son begins to see Dad in a new light when he, too, spends a night at the museum.  He discovers that his father's amazing world is real. The film's unusual and entertaining story, starring Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Mickey Rooney, and Dick Van Dyke, is faithfully recreated in this funny and fanciful novelization for young readers.",

        "Description": "Like its predecessor, this new edition reflects the way researchers actually work, in a complex circuit of thinking, writing, revising, and rethinking. It shows how each part of this process influences the others and how a successful research report is a carefully orchestrated conversation between researcher and reader. Among many topics, The Craft of Research explores how to build an argument that motivates readers to accept a claim; how to anticipate the reservations of thoughtful, yet critical readers and respond to them appropriately; and how to create introductions and conclusions that answer that most demanding question, \"So what?\"Celebrated by reviewers for its logic and clarity, this popular book retains its five-part structure. Part 1 provides an orientation to the research process and begins the discussion of what motivates researchers and their readers. Part 2 focuses on finding a topic, planning the project, and locating appropriate sources. This section is brought up to date with new information on the role of the Internet in research, including how to find and evaluate sources, avoid their misuse, and test their reliability.Part 3 explains the art of making an argument and supporting it. The authors have extensively revised this section to present the structure of an argument in clearer and more accessible terms then in the first edition. For example, new distinctions are made among reasons, evidence, and reports of evidence; and the concepts of qualifications and rebuttals, from the first edition, are here recast as acknowledgment and response. Part 4 covers drafting and revising, and offers new information on the visual representation of data. Part 5 concludes the book with an updated discussion of the ethics of research, as well as an expanded bibliography that includes many electronic sources.",

        "Description": "The dramatic lives of two bold, independent adventurers--Paul Gaugin and his grandmother Flora Tristan, a trail-blazing women's suffragist--as imagined by \"one of the master storytellers of our time\" (Chicago Tribune Book World)In 1844, Flora Trist\u00e1n embarked on a tour of France to campaign for workers' and women's rights. In 1891, her grandson Paul Gauguin set sail for Tahiti, determined to escape civilization and paint primitive masterpieces. Flora died before her grandson was born, but their travels and obsessions unfold side by side in this deft, utterly absorbing novel.Flora, the illegitimate child of a wealthy Peruvian father and French mother, grows up in poverty, and after fleeing a brutal husband, journeys to Peru to demand her inheritance. On her return, she makes her name as a popular writer and a champion of the downtrodden, setting herself the arduous task of touring the French countryside to recruit members for her Workers' Union. Paul, struggling painter and stubborn visionary, abandons his wife and five children for life in the South Seas, where his dreams of paradise are poisoned by syphilis, the stifling forces of French colonialism, and a chronic lack of funds, though he has his pick of teenage Tahitian lovers and paints some of his greatest works.Affectionate, astute, and quietly caustic, this double portrait is a rare study in passion and ambition, as well as the obstinate pursuit of greatness in the face of illness and death, from Mario Vargas Llosa, whose previous novels, The Feast of the Goat, \"pushed the boundaries of the traditional historic novel [in] a book of harrowing power and lasting resonance\" (The New York Times).",

        "Authors": "By Burani, Johanna, Brand Miller, Janette, Foster-Powell, Kaye, Brand-Miller, Jennie, and Lintner, Lisa",
        "Description": "With each passing day, yet another health, diet, and nutrition expert or author gets on the glycemic index (GI) bandwagon. In 2003 The South Beach Diet joined New York Times best-selling books by Dr. Andrew Weil, Harvard's Dr. Walter Willett, Dr. Robert Atkins, Dr. Barry Sears, and many others in advocating taking into account the GI values of foods as a key element in a healthy, lifelong diet. But the authoritative source of information on the GI remains the Glucose Revolution series&#151;and The New Glucose Revolution Life Plan is the book that situates the GI within today's complete nutrition picture. Both an introduction to the benefits of low-GI foods and an essential source of new information for those already familiar with the concept, it charts a clear course through today's complicated nutrition maze&#151;and offers easy-to-follow guidelines for choosing the right diet. This new edition has been revised throughout in two-color with an 8-page photo insert featuring some of the fifty delicious, easy-to-prepare recipes offered in the book, as well as a complete, up-to-date table of GI and new glycemic load values for more than eight hundred foods and beverages.",

        "Authors": "By Yaeger, Don and Pressler, Mike",
        "Description": "Mike Pressler walked into the bottomfloor meeting room of the Murray Building and, as he had done hundreds of times over a sixteen-year career at Duke University, prepared to address his men's lacrosse team. Forty-six players sat in theater-style chairs, all eyes riveted forward.It was 4:35 P.M. on Wednesday, April 5, 2006. The program's darkest hour had arrived in an unexpected and explosive announcement.Pressler, a three-time ACC Coach of the Year, informed his team that its season was canceled and he had \"resigned,\" effective immediately. While his words reverberated off the walls, hysteria erupted. Players cried, confused over a course of events that had spun wildly out of control. What began as an off-campus team party with two hired strippers had accelerated into a rape investigation -- one that exposed prosecutorial misconduct, shoddy police work, an administration's rush to judgment, and the media's disregard for the facts -- dividing both a prestigious university and the city of Durham.Wiping away tears, Pressler demonstrated the steely resolve that helped him win more than two hundred games. For the next thirty minutes, Pressler put his personal situation aside and encouraged his players to stick together. He also made a bold promise: \"One day, we will get a chance to tell the world the truth. One day.\"This is that day.Pressler, who has not done an interview since the saga began, has handed his private diary from those three weeks to New York Times bestselling author Don Yaeger, exposing vivid details, including the day Pressler was fired, when the coach asked Athletic Director Joe Alleva why the school \"wasn't willing to wait for the truth\" to come out. \"It's not about the truth anymore,\" Alleva said to the coach in a signature moment that said it all. In addition to Pressler, Yaeger interviewed more than seventy-five key figures intimately involved in the case. The result is a tale that defies logic.\"It is tough to be one of fifty people who believed a story when fifty million people believed something else,\" Pressler said. \"This wasn't about the truth to many of the others involved. My story is all about the truth.\"",
