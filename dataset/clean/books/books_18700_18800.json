        "Authors": "By Freeman, Michael",
        "Description": "Since its first broadcast in 1979, ESPN has grown from one man's pipe dream to a media giant, ruling the sports kingdom with in-depth news coverage, sparkling reporting, and attitude - lots of attitude. Founder Bill Rasmussen believed in his idea of a 24-hour all-sports cable channel, but few could have predicted the network would become as important to sports as the athletes themselves.In ESPN, The Uncensored History, author and New York Times sportswriter Michael Freeman takes you from the days when Rasmussen chose Bristol, Connecticut, as home base because property was so cheap to the network's expansion with ESPN2, ESPN Classic, and ESPNews, as well as ESPN, The Magazine. Along the way, Freeman provides revealing portraits of the sports channel's most compelling personalities and delves into its not-so-public aspects: the real story of its founding, allegations of sexual harassment, charges of racial discrimination, bitter partings with high-profile personnel. Using information gleaned from internal documents, police and court records; and interviews with network employees, on-air talent, producers, and executives, Freeman uncovers the news ESPN doesn't want reported.",

        "Title": "Media Circus: The Trouble with America's Newspapers",
        "Authors": "By Kurtz, Howard",
        "Description": "Journalists may have been considered heroes in the days of Watergate, bringing down a president and upholding our country's ideals of truth and justice, but today reporters are seen as a petulant, sleazy, and haughty bunch. Politicians of all stripes routinely bash the media, and the public has endorsed limits on the press that would have been unthinkable a generation ago.One of the handful of reporters who gets any respect these days is Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post. Kurtz's beat is the press itself, and he never lacks for material. Covering one's peers is a perilous task, but Kurtz is universally acknowledged as a scrupulous reporter, as well as a dogged investigator and lucid writer who can get the bottom of any story - especially the story behind the story. His articles are considered required reading in political circles, especially because he is not afraid to take his own paper to task for its misjudgments. There are no sacred cows in Kurtz's world; in fact, the standing joke in the Post newsroom is that people get nervous when they see him approaching, pen and pad in hand.In Media Circus, Kurtz ventures into America's newsrooms and press galleries to show how newspapers have bungled so many of the important stories of recent years. What he sees is not pretty: editors missing the HUD and S&L scandals while showcasing media manipulators like Donald Trump and Al Sharpton; reporters seduced by power at the White House and during the Gulf war; newspaper coverage of William Kennedy Smith and Clarence Thomas sinking into the gutter; the press continuing to shoot itself in the foot, repeatedly sidetracked by trivia and sleaze during the 1992 presidential campaign. Kurtz pulls no punches in reporting how the press has sacrificed its credibility while failing to stem the tide of newspaper closings, and how racial tensions and ethical lapses have become staples of the new newsroom culture.Laying bare the yawning gaps in the information we receive from our daily papers, Kurtz casts a highly critical eye on the work of his ink-stained colleagues. In its depth, scope, and candor, Media Circus rivals the best books written about how newspapers really work, and testifies to Kurtz's skill in reporting from \"the belly of the beast.\"",

        "Authors": "By Sadker, Myra Pollack and Sadker, David",
        "Description": "Failing at Fairness is a powerful indictment of sexism in America's classrooms. The findings from twenty years of research by two of America's most distinguished social scientists show that gender bias in our schools makes it impossible for girls to receive an education equal to boys'.Girls are systematically denied opportunities in areas where boys are encouraged to excel, often by well-meaning teachers who are unaware that they are transmitting sexist values. Girls are taught to speak quietly, to defer to boys, to avoid math and science, and to value neatness over innovation, appearance over intelligence. In the early grades girls, brimming with intelligence and potential, routinely outperform boys on achievement tests, but by the time they graduate from high school they lag far behind boys - a process of degeneration that continues into adulthood. By the time girls enter the working world, the damage has been done. Our daughters, tomorrow's women, learn that to be female is to be passive and deferential: We have, effectively, made girls second-class citizens in a world whose survival will depend on their contributions. The implications are devastating: If the cure for cancer is incubating in the mind of one of our daughters, we may never find it.Professors Myra and David Sadker have produced a comprehensive, compelling, and essential resource.",

        "Description": "With millions of Americans watching, one of the nation's most popular television personalities, Joan Lunden, made a life-altering transition with grace and ease as she brought to a close two decades of hosting Good Morning America. For the first time Joan candidly reveals how she approached such an enormous challenge as an opportunity for growth -- and how you can, too.For each change that occurred during the course of those twenty years, Joan had an entire nation watching her respond, commenting on the things that she did, critiquing the way that she did them, and putting forth opinions on what she should do next: \"People I had never met constantly offered me suggestions about how I should handle my divorce, how I should raise my children, and the career choices I should make after GMA. I was a private citizen with the normal stresses that a mother, wife, and businesswoman endures on a daily basis, going through life's changes in a public arena.\"We all go through change. Whether it's an illness in the family, a divorce, teenagers acting out, losing a job, having to move, or kids leaving the nest, one thing is certain: Change is the only thing we can count on. Yet, while change is the one constant in our lives, it often produces the greatest amount of fear. In this inspiring new book, Joan shows us the importance of staying levelheaded in the face of crisis no matter what or whom you're facing.Both an intimate self-portrait and a practical blueprint for living a happier, more fulfilling life, A Bend in the Road is Not the End of the Road proves once again why so many viewers have followed Joan Lunden for so many years.",

        "Description": "From its famous left-field wall, known as the Green Monster, to its wonderfully anachronistic hand-operated scoreboard, Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, is alive with personality and history. Fenway is the setting for the jewel of baseball's myths, the \"curse of the Bambino,\" that twentieth-century plague which annually dooms the Red Sox's quest for a World Series title. In a world where Astroturf and labor disputes seem to dominate baseball, Fenway links us to the game as it's meant to be played: as a national pastime that is part scorekeeping and part storytelling.There are stories aplenty in At Fenway, Dan Shaughnessy's tribute to this grande dame of ballparks. He tells us why Fenway was built in such a quirky, intimate style and how its unique architecture has affected the Red Sox style of baseball. He introduces us to Red Sox Nation, the global community of Sox fans that thrives despite the team's tragic history. And Shaughnessy meditates on the four seasons of the Red Sox calendar - from the burgeoning hope of spring training through the agony of autumn collapse and winter anguish.",

Emma's black friends place demands on her that she struggles against, finding herself trapped between two warring camps - white and black - instinctively resisting the rigid definitions of both.Emma's story and Melvin's are told against the background of a country roiled by anger and hatred, a country that seems to have lost its soul while blacks and whites try to find a way to live together or live apart.",

It was Dora Diamant, an independent spirit who fled her Polish Hasidic family to pursue her Zionist dreams, who persuaded Kafka to leave his parents and live with her in Berlin the year before he died. Although many credit (or blame) her for burning many of his papers, as he had requested, she also held onto many others - papers that the Gestapo confiscated and that have yet to be recovered. Dora's life after Kafka - from her days as a struggling agitprop actress in Berlin to her sojourn in Moscow in the 1930s, from her wartime escape to Great Britain, to her first emotional visit to the new nation of Israel - offers a prism through which we can view the cultural and political history of twentieth-century Europe.Based on original sources and interviews, including previously unseen material from the Comintern and Gestapo archives and Dora's newly-discovered notebook, diary and letters, Kafka's Last Love illuminates the life of a literary 'wife' who, like Vera Nabokov and Nora Joyce, is a remarkable woman in her own right.",

Listening to his sets out to capture the stories on paper. He is a Mann, Grandpa reminds him daily, and thus destined for greatness.

Because of the high profiles of the victims - a politically connected socialite and his glamorous fiancee - the mayor of San Francisco herself demands that a high-ranking detective be put on the case. And so Abe Glitsky is thrust into the controversial investigation.Dan Cuneo, the officer already working the case, is immediately wary of Glitsky and doesn't hide his distrust. Matters are made worse when Cuneo starts to focus on his primary suspect - who also happens to be an old girlfriend of Dismas Hardy's. For Hardy and Glitsky, this is an awkward and uncomfortable coincidence. But for Cuneo, it's proof positive of collusion, and yet another instance of Glitsky cheating with his insider friends and cronies.Convinced that Hardy's client is the wrong suspect, Glitsky breaks ranks within the police department to continue his own investigation. As Hardy's murder trial builds to its stunning conclusion, Glitsky's search for the truth does more than fuel suspicion against the two men. It reveals a trail of deception that leads beyond San Francisco, where exposing desperate secrets can be the most deadly offense.",

        "Description": "In 1945 the U.S. was the founding impulse behind the cornerstones   of the International Community: the World   Bank, International Monetary Fund and most of all the   United Nations. Untainted by colonialism or fascism,   heroic in warfare and idealistic at home, the U.S. presented   itself as a paragon to inspire a less noble and   divided world. Sixty years later, that perception had been   almost completely reversed.   America had, in fact, quietly sowed the seeds of its   own decline in the eyes of the world in its own back yard.   Anti-Americanism, now a global phenomenon, was road   tested in South America when most of the rest of the world   was too distracted to notice or care. There, under the guise   of anti-communism, we sponsored dictatorships, turned a   blind eye to killing squads and tolerated the subversion of   democracy. Almost nobody knew, so it didn't matter, right?   Wrong. On two counts. First, South America remembered.   And second, encouraged by our success, we convinced   ourselves that pre-emptive Americanism was a   policy that could be shipped worldwide. This proved to be   a big misjudgment. The world noticed and, helped by better   scrutiny and faster technology, anti-Americanism   flourished among America's closest allies beyond the   Americas in a way and to a depth not seen before. As this   reaches a crucial tipping point, Julia Sweig offers a brilliant   and blistering history of what went wrong, and a   feisty and compelling prescription for how to sort it out.",

Twelve days earlier, he had an enviable life as a successful surgeon, living in a peaceful suburban neighborhood with his beautiful wife and a baby he adored. Now he lies in a hospital bed, shot by an unseen assailant. His wife has been killed, and his six-month-old daughter, Tara, has vanished.

For Nicky, this time it was no petty crime or misdemeanor.The call came two days after they had put him in custody, at a little before 6 A.M.

In a single volume you get \"A Book of Nonsense,\" \"Nonsense Songs,\" \"More Nonsense Songs,\" \"Laughable Lyrics,\" and \"Nonsense Songs and Stories. No other low-price edition offers this complete collection.You will meet such old favorites as \"The Dong With a Luminous Nose,\" \"The Jumblies,\" \"The Owl and the Pussycat,\" \"The Nutcrackers and the Sugar Tongs,\" and \"The History of the Seven Young Owls.\" Two hundred and fourteen limericks are in here as well, each illustrated with the drawing Lear composed specially for it. In addition, you'll find three different sets of Nonsense Botany, five Nonsense Alphabets, and dozens of other selections in both prose and verse.All 546 of Lear's original illustrations are in this volume. With masterful simplicity and apparent naivet\u00e9 they tell of the dreamlike never-never land of childhood. Many Lear enthusiasts maintain that in these drawings the Laureate of Nonsense gave rise to an entire new style. Their influence has certainly been widespread, with echoes of Lear to be seen in the work of Thurber, Steinberg, Phil May, Bateman, and other artists and illustrators.It has been a hundred years since Edward Lear, the advocate of illogic, first became known to a wide public. Children who begged to have his verses read to them have grown up to read Lear to their own children \u2014 and to discover that his whimsy, imagination, and originality have their attraction for the adult mind as well.",

        "Description": "In our everyday business lives we all experience moments of failure and rejection. Some people take these negative experiences personally, allowing the resulting anxieties to sap their initiatives and make them cautious and defensive. Successful people, however, look at failure differently than anyone else! They see it as an opportunity for learning, a springboard to creativity, and a chance to test new ideas. In fact, the way we choose to handle failure is a greater predictor of future success than any other single factor - including talent, drive, and hard work!The operative word here is \"choose.\"Just because you've been anxious, defensive, and disheartened in the face of failure doesn't mean you have to remain that way, says motivational expert Art Mortell. A positive response to failure - one that emphasizes the qualities of resilience, personal growth, and, believe it or not, humor - can be learned. And Art Mortell should know. As one of the most sought-after motivational speakers in the country, he's taught his unique methods to such major firms as IBM, Merrill Lynch, Prudential Securities, and Price Waterhouse. Now in this, the most important business book you will ever read, he reveals his proven prescriptions for using failure and rejection as stepping stones to future success. Discover how to change your perception of reality as a way of thriving on failure and assuring your success, how to recover swiftly from professional setbacks and become more objective, how to be amused by rejection and capitalize on negative feedback, how to raise your self-image and unleash the power of your own motivation, how to use anxiety to identify your vulnerabilities and replace them with new resiliencies, how to become risk-oriented and excel without risking burn-out, how to eliminate the 10 negative addictions most often used when coping with stress, how to convert potentially paralyzing anxiety into added energy that assures creative results, and much more!",

Ten themes emerged from this study of life's meaning: Life is to be enjoyed; We are here to help others; The meaning of life is a mystery; Life is meaningless; We are here to serve God; Life is a struggle; We are here to contribute to society; We are here to seek wisdom and self-actualization; We must create meaning for ourselves; Life is absurd.

While other books have offered hot zones, sick monkeys, and grim statistics, Level 4 brings home from the world of the virus the human stories of those who lived, and those who died.",

Their culture remains largely obscure, but in Isabel Fonseca they have found an eloquent witness. \u00a0 In Bury Me Standing, alongside unforgettable portraits of individuals\u2014the poet, the politician, the child prostitute\u2014Fonseca offers sharp insights into the humor, language, wisdom, and taboos of the Roma. She traces their exodus out of India 1,000 years ago and their astonishing history of persecution: enslaved by the princes of medieval Romania; massacred by the Nazis; forcibly assimilated by the communist regimes; evicted from their settlements in Eastern Europe, and most recently, in Western Europe as well. Whether as handy scapegoats or figments of the romantic imagination, the Gypsies have always been with us\u2014but never before have they been brought so vividly to life. \u00a0 Includes fifty black and white photos.",

The third part, \"Like Beauty,\" evokes a New York 150 years into the future, when the city is all but overwhelmed by refugees from the first inhabited planet to be contacted by the people of Earth.Presiding over each episode of this interrelated whole is the prophetic figure of the poet Walt Whitman, who promised his future readers, \"It avails not, neither time or place . . . I am with you, and know how it is.\" Specimen Days is a genre-bending, haunting, and transformative ode to life in our greatest city and a meditation on the direction and meaning of America's destiny. It is a work of surpassing power and beauty by one of the most original and daring writers at work today.",

        "Description": "From December 2003 to May 2005, Daniel Okrent served  as the New York Times' first \"Public Editor,\" a position created  following the newspaper's Jayson Blair scandal and  the tumultuous reign and resignation of Howell Raines as  Executive Editor. His mission: read the paper and provide  his assessments, without guidance from the paper itself  and without fear or favor, of how well it executed its  responsibility to provide objective, accurate, and complete  coverage of the world-at-large. Not an easy task, but the  New York Times chose the right writer for the job.  Experienced, wise and witty, opinionated but never shrill,  he delivered.  Okrent addressed subjects ranging from WMD  coverage, reporter self-promotion, pulling for or piling on  political candidates, and corrections policy, to the Tony  Awards, to the great delight and consternation of the  paper's readers, and those in its own newsroom. Now,  collected, amended, and assessed by Okrent here are the  complete columns of his rocky and illuminating eighteen  months along with an evaluation of the entire experience;  its ups and downs and what he thinks he got right and got  wrong. This is a smart, serious, entertaining, and longlasting  look at what today's finest journalism does well?  and what it can do better.",
