        "Title": "Hope Matters: The Untold Story of How Faith Works in America",
        "Authors": "By Calhoun, John A.",
        "Description": "Mary Gonzales strolls the streets of Chicago's meatpacking district every evening, keeping a watchful eye over \"her\" neighborhood kids. Tony Ortiz encourages young men in California state prisons to break free of the brutal gang life he once knew all too well. Joe Hynes, Brooklyn's district attorney, champions women and children, not wanting them to suffer as he suffered.They, and the twenty-one other amazing people interviewed by Jack Calhoun, are reshaping lives and communities across America. They include Christians of every denomination, Muslims, Jews, and others, some who pray five times a day and some who are, frankly, \"not that religious.\"But each tells Calhoun, there's much more to the story.You may have heard of some of these Americans. Several are in the news. The good words of all shine brightly in their communities. What you haven't heard about is the underlying force, the hidden source of their seemingly endless energy and selflessness.It is faith -- a deep and, in some cases, unsuspected spirituality. They have the unshakable sense that they work not only for their organizations -- and each individual they encounter -- but especially for God.Calhoun was once an eager divinity school student, hungry to make a difference. Through the years he rose to national prominence in the field of public policy, spending twenty-plus years as the founding president of the National Crime Prevention Council. However, something wasn't right. Caught up in a parade of committee meetings, speaking engagements, and policy and program initiatives, he had lost touch with the bedrock of his vocation. It took an encounter with an unusually clear-sighted volunteer to reconnect his daily work to his faith in God.Reinvigorated, Calhoun embarked on a two-year cross-country quest to find out how faith motivates some of America's hardest-working public servants. They pursue a range of innovative and ambitious plans to help their communities, and their accomplishments are impressive. But just try telling them so.They have been chosen, they'll explain, to fulfill a larger purpose. Their paths have been rocky, their burdens heavy, and the work hasn't always been fun. Yet they feel blessed, emboldened by their trust in a higher power to live lives of acceptance and unbounded love.Some recent books have laid divisiveness and hostility at faith's door. \"Hope Matters\" brings to light the togetherness and reconciliation that faith truly engender when good people heed its call to action.You won't hear Mary, Tony, Joe or the rest preaching from the pulpit, or even in the streets. They have no sermon or script to follow. There is a ministry of open arms and second chances, of waking up each morning with new challenges and going to bed each night with renewed faith. Their stories just might inspire you to make your own \"place of worship\" a little bigger.",

        "Description": "What ever happened to our inalienable rights?The Constitution was once the bedrock of our country, an unpretentious parchment that boldly established the God-given rights and freedoms of America. Today that parchment has been shred to ribbons, explains Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, as the federal government trounces state and individual rights and expands its reach far beyond what the Framers intended.An important follow-up to Judge Napolitano's best-selling Constitutional Chaos, this book shows with no-nonsense clarity how Congress has \"purchased\" regulations by bribing states and explains how the Supreme Court has devised historically inaccurate, logically inconsistent, and even laughable justifications to approve what Congress has done.It's an exciting excursion into the dark corners of the law, showing how do-gooders, busybodies, and control freaks in government disregard the limitations imposed upon Congress by the Constitution and enact laws, illegal and unnatural, in virtually every area of human endeavor. Advance Praise for The Constitution in Exile from Left, Right, and Center\"Does anyone understand the vision of America's founding fathers? The courts and Congress apparently don't have a clue. But Judge Andrew P. Napolitano does, and so will you, if you readThe Constitution in Exile.\"-BILL O'REILLY \"Whatever happened to states rights, limited government, and natural law? Judge Napolitano, in his own inimitable style, takes us on a fascinating tour of the destruction of constitutional government. If you want to know how the federal government got so big and fat, read this book. Agree or disagree, this book will make you think.\"-SEAN HANNITY\"In all of the American media, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano is the most persistent, uncompromising guardian of both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, very much including the Bill of Rights. Increasingly, our Constitution is in clear and present danger. Judge Napolitano-in The Constitution in Exile-has challenged all Americans across party lines to learn the extent of this constitutional crisis.\"-NAT HENTOFF\"Judge Napolitano engages here in what I do every day on my program-make you think. There's no question that potential Supreme Court nominees and what our Constitution says and doesn't say played a major role for many voters in our last couple of elections. What the judge does here is detail why the federal government claims it can regulate as well as tax everything in sight as it grows and grows. Agree or disagree with him-you need to read his latest book, think, and begin to arm yourself as you enter this important debate.\"-RUSH LIMBAUGH\"At a time when we are, in Benjamin Franklin's words, sacrificing essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, here comes the judge with what should be mandatory reading for the executive branch cronies who are busy stealing power while they think we're not watching. Thank goodness the judge is watching and speaking truth to power. More than a book, this is an emergency call to philosophical arms, one we must heed before it's too late.\"-ALAN COLMES",

        "Authors": "By Gasteier, Matthew",
        "Description": "Perfect for the Scrooge in your life\u2014a profane, hilarious takedown of all things cute and cuddly, by the author of the blog sensation of (almost) the same nameAttention, all you clumsy pandas, lovable puffins, huggable bunnies, and penguins  that elicit ooohs and aaahs: The jig is up! We have lived under your furry fists  for too long. There is a cute and present danger lurking out there\u2013in the wild,  in the zoos, and sometimes even in our very own homes. Spurred on by the Cute Industrial  Complex, these cuddly animals have taken over blockbuster films, inspirational posters,  and computer desktops everywhere, further weakening the innocent civilians who are  beguiled by these fuzzy frauds. But you are stronger than them, aren\u2019t you? Those  soft bellies and wet noses are no match for you\u2013and their free ride has just come  to an end.  F U, Penguin is the rallying cry for those who choose to fight these  power-hungry cute-mongers. Loaded with color photographs and hilarious commentary,  this book will have you laughing out loud while it simultaneously saves you from  the tragic fate of tossing yarn with big-eyed kittens and bottle-nursing baby pandas  forever. ___________________________ \"Finally, a book for the rest of us! Most  animals go about our business without playing to the audience like the elitists exposed  in these chapters.I wasn't sure how many more times I could hear about those great  penguins and pandas and kittens before I started eating people... well, more people,  anyway.\"\u2014Jerry the Shark \"Penguins killed my parents, and they would not hesitate  to kill me. I thank the Crustacean God for Matthew Gasteier, a true saint and a decent  human being in a world filled with heartless penguin accomplices.\"\u2014Dennis the Krill \"It's all true. We're the worst.\"\u2014Anonymous Penguin \"The average dolphin is far  beyond this level of vulgarity, but I could see how this would be a very enjoyable  book for humans. I should remember to hand these out to some of my slower relatives  at the common ancestor reunion.\"\u2014Edward the Dolphin \"Thank you for your submission.  Unfortunately, this style of book is not something we are currently looking for.  However, we wish you the best of luck with your human publishers!\"\u2014Danielle the Bear,  Editor-in-Chief, Random Cave Publishing",

        "Description": "\u201cBereavement after the loss of a baby is often quiet and lonely,\u201d writes  Christine O\u2019Keeffe Lafser, who has twice lost a child to death. \u201cThere is no  wake or funeral, no grave site, no memorial to our baby\u2019s life or death. . . .  Since there are no real memories of our little one\u2019s life, people have a hard  time comprehending the depth of our love and grief.\u201d In these reflections,  Lafser offers grieving parents the empathy and courage that can come only from  one who has walked the same difficult path.\u201cChris expressed so many of my thoughts and feelings and made me feel  so normal. . . . The greatest gift is learning that God does not desert us in  our time of need.\u201dLinda Davis, Compassionate Friends, after miscarriage and  stillbirth\u201cThe juxtaposition of a Scripture text with each reflection is  inspired. Some of the texts are breathtaking in their beauty and  appropriateness. This book is a \u2018must\u2019 for anyone who is ever touched by the  loss of an infant.\u201dJoseph Awad, poet and grieving grandfather\u201cThis book will be very helpful for parents who are mourning the loss  of their child. It will also prove very beneficial to anyone who is ministering  to a bereaved parent.\u201dRobert N. Craig, O.F.M. Cap., hospital chaplain\u201cThese reflections allowed me to \u2018be\u2019 how I was feeling\u2014not feel like I  should be going through the stages of grief that other books described. With  this book I was no longer a square peg trying to fit into a round  hole.\u201dJeanette Siebels, after infant death",

To protect Arthur, Hal summons the Knights of the Round Table from their enchanted slumber in the mists of Camelot.  The Knights--now New York City's newest motorcycle club--find the 20th century a confusing time, but they know their mission--fight evil and save the King.In the final battle, Arthur learns that having right on your side is not always enough.  Sometimes there are sacrifices to be made.  Will the Round Table never rise again?  Will this Camelot, like the last, fade too soon into memory?",

        "Description": "The real story of the Republican vice presidential nominee and her collision with the elite liberal media  As the second woman ever nominated as a candidate for vice president, Alaska governor Sarah Palin became an instant phenomenon. Americans were enthralled by a woman with charm, ambition, natural political talent, and a passion for conservative values. But the fascination of ordinary people quickly drew an unprecedented attack from the media elite and liberal activists. Far beyond the normal bounds of tough questions and challenges, Palin's enemies decided that nothing was too personal to attack-including her marriage, her children, her faith, and her ward\u00adrobe. The media distorted Palin's positions and beliefs beyond recognition. And almost every word out of her mouth was spun as a \"flub.\" Weekly Standard writer Matthew Continetti reveals the true story of the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and her persecution by the elites who tried to hide their bias with solemn declarations of objectivity. Continetti offers fresh examples of malicious spin and deceit and shows how liberal snobbery has become a driving force in American politics. Palin's ordeal has become a rallying cry for the GOP in the Obama era. This perceptive book is a must-read for conservatives who want to understand what really happened-and how to avoid a repeat.",

In these beautiful sepia-toned photographs, Jim Dratfield captures the spirit, strength, and nobility of horses.Paired with quotations that include everyone from James Thurber to Amelia Earhart, Henrik Ibsen to Lauren Bacall, and ranging from the inspirational to the absolutely hilarious, The Quotable Equine celebrates these magnificent animals. Jim Dratfield has traveled the world to capture in both candid and portrait photography the essence of the equine, in the most stunning settings, from dancing Andalusians in Spain to workhorses in Mongolia.Whether it's a child obstinately pulling her donkey, a horse running free in the wild, or an intense moment at an equestrian competition, the images in this book are charming, poignant, gorgeous, and sometimes amusing.  The Quotable Equine pays homage to the timeless elegance of horses, to the many disciplines and sports built around them, and to all the people who love them.",

Yet American Christians are deeply divided about what it means to follow him. Bible scholar Borg takes us on a journey to discover who Jesus was, what he taught, and why he still matters today. Borg argues that how we see Jesus affects how we see Christianity and reveals a new way of seeing--a new perspective that can overcome the differences between the literalists and progressives, a path that emphasizes following \"the way\" of Jesus, the original name of the Jesus movement. Jesus remains the decisive revelation of God, but we now encounter him as both a reality and a role model centered in God, focused on both personal and political transformation, emphasizing practices rather than beliefs, and exemplifying a faith characterized by deep commitment and gentle certitude.--From publisher description.A revised version of the author's major work on the historical Jesus demonstrates how the Gospels can be understood, rather than undermined, through historical analysis, in an edition that incorporates recent scholarship.",

Nicknamed \u201cHeck\u201d because of his reluctance to curse, he is a typical soldier, willing to do his duty without fuss or much musing about grand goals. The night before he is trucked into the combat zone, Heck meets a young French refugee and her family, an encounter that unsettles him greatly.It is during his first, horrific exposure to combat that Heck discovers a dark truth about himself: He is a coward. Shamed by his fears and tortured by the never-ending physical dangers around him, he struggles to survive, to live up to the ideal of the American fighting man, and to make sense of his feelings for the young French woman. As the stark reality of combat\u2014the knowledge that he could cease to exist at any moment\u2014presses in on him, Heck makes a series of choices that would be rational in every human situation except war. With remorseless, hypnotic clarity, Arvin draws readers into the unimaginable fear, violence, and chaos of the war zone. Arvin layers profound meaning within a brilliantly executed minimalist style. His portrayal of the emotional and physical terrors Heck can neither understand nor escape is one of the most disturbing and unforgettable accounts of the life of a soldier ever written.",

I had the romantic thing with my first husband, thank you very much, she tells a hapless suitor. I'm thirty-eight years old, and I've got a daughter learning to read and a job I don't quite like. I don't need the violin music. But when the new tenant in her in-law apartment turns out to be Michael Christopher, on the lam after twenty years in a monastery and smack dab in the middle of a dark night of the soul, Rebecca begins to suspect that she is not as thoroughly disillusioned as she had thought.Her daughter, Mary Martha, is delighted with the new arrival, as is Rebecca's mother, Phoebe, a rollicking widow making a new life for herself among the spiritual eccentrics of the coastal town of Bolinas. Even Rebecca's best friend, Bonnie, once a confirmed cynic in matters of the heart, urges Rebecca on. But none of them, Rebecca feels, understands how complicated and dangerous love actually is.As her unlikely friendship with the ex-monk grows toward something deeper, and Michael wrestles with his despair while adjusting to a second career flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, Rebecca struggles with her own temptation to hope. But it is not until she is brought up short by the realities of life and death that she begins to glimpse the real mystery of love, and the unfathomable depths of faith.Beautifully written and playfully engaging, this novel. is about one man wrestling with his yearning for a life of contemplation and the need for a life of action in the world. But it's Rebecca's spirit, as well as her relationships with Mary Martha, Phoebe, her irresponsible surfer ex-husband Rory -- and, of course, the monk downstairs -- that makes this story shine.",

        "Description": "Whether forming a pirate gang to search for buried treasure or spending a quiet time at home, sharing his medicine with Aunt Polly's cat, the irrepressible Tom Sawyer evokes the world of boyhood in nineteenth century rural America. In this classic story, Mark Twain re-created a long-ago world of freshly whitewashed fences and Sunday school picnics into which sordid characters and violent incidents sometimes intruded. The tale powerfully appeals to both adult and young imaginations. Readers explore this memorable setting with a slyly humorous born storyteller as their guide. Tom and Huck Finn conceal themselves in the town cemetery, where they witness a grave robbery and a murder. Later, the boys, feeling unappreciated, hide out on a forested island while the townspeople conduct a frantic search and finally mourn them as dead. The friends triumphantly return to town to attend their own funeral, in time for a dramatic trial for the graveyard murder. A three-day ordeal ensues when Tom and his sweetheart, Becky Thatcher, lose their way in the very cave that conceals the murderer. With its hilarious accounts of boyish pranks and its shrewd assessments of human nature, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer has captivated generations of readers of all ages. This inexpensive edition of the classic novel offers a not-to-be-missed opportunity to savor a witty and action-packed account of small-town boyhood in a bygone era.",
