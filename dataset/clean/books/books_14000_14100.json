The women are pleased to be accepted into the donor program by the Wingate Infertility Clinic, and the procedures are done quickly, with minimal inconvenience. Both women are impressed by the clinic and its personnel. With her background in biology, Deborah applauds the organization's commitment to research, while Joanna is intrigued by the business aspect; she had no idea treating infertility was such a lucrative endeavor. With the money earned from their donations, Deborah's and Joanna's circumstances change dramatically. After using the lion's share of the proceeds as a down payment on a two-bedroom condominium, the friends splurge on an extended trip to Venice. When they return, Joanna can't resist the urge to look into the fate of their donated eggs. Deborah is quickly drawn in, and curiosity turns into full-blown obsession as the pair is stymied by Wingate's iron veil of secrecy. The women remain undeterred, particularly after uncovering some disturbing irregularities at the clinic. And the truth they ultimately discover far exceeds the very worst they had imagined.",

        "Description": "Andy Pasztor shows how in the 1980s a new breed of high-priced consultants and influence peddlers rose to prominence and changed the face of the Pentagon. And he illustrates how Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of the Navy John Lehman - through their political agendas and management styles - set the stage for and unwittingly tolerated the criminal activity of others.Indeed, Lehman's assistant secretary, Melvyn Paisley, ran his office like a personal fiefdom, shamelessly pocketing bribes, dividing up a \"shopping list\" of multibillion-dollar contracts to help his buddies and even steering highly classified radar work to a fledgling firm he and a partner secretly controlled.This shocking look behind the nation's defense spending spree, described by one senator as an eight-year gravy train for contractors, reveals:Payoffs and rigged bids, arranged in elegant hotel suites from Manhattan to London and in the luxurious staterooms of the Queen Elizabeth II, were recorded by FBI surveillance teams and hidden microphones.A \"slush fund\" of as much as $32 million helped one company lavishly entertain lawmakers and funnel illegal campaign contributions to scores of senators and congressmen. \"Members only move if you're doing something for them,\" the mastermind of the scheme explained. \"I understand what they want.\"Clandestine libraries for bootlegged Pentagon documents were set up at Boeing and other giant firms, while executives exchanged illicit classified material on street corners as matter-of-factly as kids trading baseball cards.Pasztor bases his disturbing account on never-before-disclosed grand jury testimony, wiretap transcripts and interviews with more than 130 people nationwide, from federal prosecutors to Pentagon appointees and convicted felons.",

Bush. Indeed, Christian fundamentalists made up close to 40 percent of the president\u2019s electorate in 2004, and their turnout increased by some four million voters over 2000.As Esther Kaplan shows in her richly detailed investigation, it\u2019s no wonder the Christian right voted for Bush in droves\u2014their loyal support in 2000 produced fantastic results. While organizations that offer abortion counseling and services or help to prevent HIV see their funds cut, church groups receive millions in federal dollars to promote sexual abstinence and marriage (provided, of course, it is heterosexual). Bush has appointed a Christian right dream team to the federal courts, dedicated to tearing down what one such judge calls \u201cthe so-called separation of church and state. Religious zeal even shapes Bush\u2019s foreign policy, as Christian belief in the end times spurs the administration\u2019s support for hard-line policies in Israel.A prescient study of the Christian right\u2019s growing political clout, With God on Their Side is essential reading for anyone concerned about America\u2019s direction.",

        "Title": "The Wives of Henry VIII",
        "Authors": "By Fraser, Antonia",
        "Description": "The wives of Henry VIII have come down to us through history narrowly defined by the roles they played in the larger story of the King's life, and most commonly remembered for the manner in which each did - or did not - survive marriage to him. Now, in this richly dramatic and singularly illuminating study, Antonia Fraser uncovers the complex and fascinating individuals whose true characters have been shrouded for centuries by stereotype and legend.In a sweeping narrative and with her own enthralling amalgam of meticulous scholarship and the lively play of ideas, Fraser makes clear the remarkably high level of strength and intelligence displayed by these six women at a time when their sex traditionally possessed little of either. She brings to light, for example: the tenacious self-possession displayed by Catherine of Aragon when, toward the end of her twenty-four-year marriage, she met the King's demands for a divorce with steadfast refusal . . . Anne Boleyn's 'curiously modern' independence of mind - initially dazzling to the King (and shocking to most everyone else), but ultimately the cause of her gruesome demise . . . the circumspect wisdom that allowed Jane Seymour to emerge as an object of universal welcome and lasting admiration in a year that saw two other queens as well ... the touching dignity of Anna of Cleves - dubbed 'The Flanders Mare' by an insensitive court - during her bewilderingly short and demeaning tenure as consort . . . the naivete of Katherine Howard - not yet twenty when the King turned his eye toward her - whose indiscretions were more nearly the result of innocence than deviousness . . . the surprisingly subversive side of the otherwise submissive Catherine Parr, one of only eight women whose writings were published during the sixty years of the first two Tudor reigns.The author traces the ascent and decline of each woman - and the linkages between them - delineating the cultural, familial, and political roots of the behavior and incidents that marked each of their reigns. She makes clear the complex moral and cultural life of the court; the international jockeying and warring for power and empire and the web of aristocratic alliances and enmities that fueled its politics; the impact of the onset of the Protestant Reformation on the court in general and on its principal denizens in particular. We see the effect each queen had on the workings of the court and on the King at its center. And we see, finally, the extent to which the fate of each woman was decided by the King's volatile - often surprisingly romantic - nature, and by his absolute, unwavering preoccupation with a male heir.Written with all the intelligence, humor, and elan, as well as the exceptional powers of research and synthesis, that we have come to expect from Antonia Fraser, The Wives of Henry VIII is a superb work of history through which these six remarkable women become, at last, as memorable for their own achievements - and mistakes - as they have always been for their fateful link to Henry VIII.",

What Ike finds shocks him to his core: cattle starving in the snow, or freezing where they stand, and a brooding Stubblefield near bankruptcy, living off the meat of his dying herd, too proud to accept help.Stubblefield is the heir of an old Montana family; Ike, a Wisconsin native, came west to marry the daughter of another rancher. As sheriff, Ike is something of an outsider, caught between one rancher's rights and the larger law of the community. His attempt to help backfires, and Ike is troubled to learn that Chas is gathering support in town among people who believe that a man's land and property are his own to use as he chooses. But Ike does not know that the rancher is planning revenge, a plot that will target Ike's wife, Pattiann - a woman with a past her husband does not fully understand, a past in which Chas Stubblefleld figured intimately.",

        "Title": "Fear of Fifty: A Midlife Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Jong, Erica",
        "Description": "A publishing event, a real-life novel, Fear of Fifty is the true story of the woman who twenty years ago showed her generation how to soar in Fear of Flying and now looks back - and ahead - to assess the costs, the rewards, and the meaning of the journey.Opening on her fiftieth birthday, Erica Jong's midlife memoir reads like fast-paced fiction as it flashes back and forth in time to tell at last the truths at the heart of her novels. Poet, novelist, essayist, Jong has forged one of the most visible, and volatile, careers in American letters, and as a charter member of what she calls the \"whiplash generation,\" she has had a front seat on the roller coaster American women have been riding for the past decades. Raised to be Doris Day, growing up wanting to be Gloria Steinem, now rearing daughters in the age of Princess Di and Madonna, today's women have had their expectations raised and dashed and raised and dashed again, as they've watched themselves go in and out of style like hemlines. Now, as she and her contemporaries look for answers to the second half of their lives, Jong offers powerful, provocative insights into sex, marriage, and aging; feminism - past, present, and future; the writing life; motherhood and family; identity and love, loyalty and loss, drawn through the brilliant prism of her own experience.In chapters such as \"Fear of Fifty,\" \"The Mad Lesbian in the Attic,\" \"How I Got to Be the Second Sex,\" \"How I Got to Be Jewish,\" \"Fear of Fame,\" \"Seducing the Muse,\" \"Dona Juana Gets Smart,\" \"Becoming Venetian,\" and \"How to Get Married,\" Erica Jong takes readers on an impassioned, outrageous, irreverent tour de force through the sea changes that have defined a generation. From technical virginity to the sexual revolution to the AIDS pandemic; from The Feminine Mystique to \"political correctness\"; from monogamy to open marriage and back again; from stay-at-home moms to moms who have won the right to be eternally exhausted; from sexual secrecy to sexual openness - Jong proves yet again her unique ability to tap into the inner lives of women and the issues that matter most to them.Fear of Fifty is an intoxicating, riveting read, free-wheeling and fun, warm, tough, and full of wisdom. Sure to be embraced by women everywhere, it is destined, like its classic predecessor Fear of Flying, to become required reading for a generation on the threshold of a new revolution.",

        "Description": "Playland is a tough, mordantly funny, splendidly layered novel about Hollywood in the 1940s and America in the 1990s, about fame and its excesses, honor and personal betrayal, and a fifty-year search for what may or may not be the truth. At its center is Blue Tyler, a spoiled, untamed child star who disappeared from Hollywood in disgrace when she was twenty and reappeared forty-five years and eleven marriages later as a mysterious bag lady in a trailer park outside Detroit.\"Everyone living or dead seemed to have an opinion about Blue Tyler,\" observes Jack Broderick, the screenwriter-narrator of Playland. \"Genius. Whore. Iconoclast. Madwoman. Liar. Free spirit.\" Winner of an Academy Award at ten, and the sole survivor of the 1942 plane crash that took the life of Carole Lombard, she had seemed blessed with luck and accountable to no one. It was her willfulness that attracted the gangster Jacob King, whose murderous history and volcanic furies satisfied Blue's every need to flout convention.Jack Broderick accidentally rediscovers Blue Tyler and begins seeking answers to questions unasked for decades. The clues lead him to a vibrant assortment of characters: Maury Ahearne, a sinister Detroit homicide cop; Schlomo Buchalter, an eighty-four-pound retired hit man dying of cancer; Morris Lefkowitz, the furrier king of organized crime; Meta Dierdorf, Blue's childhood friend whose murder is still unsolved fifty years after the fact; the mogul J. F. French; and the two caretakers of Blue's reputation, J. F.'s son, Arthur, and Chuckie O'Hara, a homosexual film director, war hero, ex-communist, and namer of names before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Together they hold the key to the mystery of Blue Tyler. Where had she been in the half century since she vanished? Who would profit from her past and her uncertain future? How much of what she, Arthur French, and Chuckie O'Hara remembered could be believed? These questions and their harsh and often conflicting answers move Playland inexorably toward its startling climax.",

        "Description": "One of the most talented centers ever to play basketball, Bill Walton led the way to two NCAA championships at UCLA under Coach John Wooden. After being selected by the Portland Trail Blazers as the number one pick in the 1974 draft, Walton became one of the league's best players - and his shooting and rebounding records are still on the books. Winning the NBA championship with the Blazers in 1977, Walton was named MVP, and went on to join the 1986 championship Boston Celtics team, winning the NBA's Sixth Man Award.Now, in Nothing But Net, Bill Walton describes his colorful basketball career, recalling the highs and lows, the wins and the losses, that marked his time in the paint. From participating in UCLA antiwar protests, to the exciting Memphis State game in which he made 21 out of 22 shots; to why he chose not to play in the 1972 Olympics - it's all here, as well as the excitement of playing against top NBA adversaries Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dr. J., and Michael Jordan, and the thrill of playing with Celtics teammates Larry Bird, Dennis Johnson, and Kevin McHale.Walton delivers his opinions on coaches, players, and teams, and details his off-air activities as well, from helping coach Shaquille O'Neal, to going on the road with the Grateful Dead, to his thrilling induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Nothing But Net is a provocative account from someone who knows basketball on court as well as behind the camera, and whose love of the game comes through with every word.",

Barbara W. Tuchman places the Revolution in the context of the centuries-long conflicts between England and both France and Holland, demonstrating how the aid to the American colonies of both these nations made the triumph of independence possible.

And the future of the colony was as bright as the giant comet that hung in the Martian sky, a symbol of the red planet's coming rebirth. For out beyond the orbit of Pluto, in the swarm of comets called the Oort Cloud, miners were harnessing the vast potential locked in those icy bodies - and setting them on a long journey to Mars, where they would be used to bring water, air, and life to the barren colony.Dekker longed to become an Oort miner like his father before him. And so he worked for years to earn the expensive passage to Earth, the only place where comet miners were trained. But when Dekker finally arrived at the Mars Project's Colorado center, he discovered that he might be too late: The growing anxiety of the Project's backers and competition from orbital farm habitats were threatening to shut down the Oort miners.Dekker was not prepared for the dual pressures of culture shock and the looming loss of his dream. Only the docility and nonviolence of his Martian upbringing helped him to control his growing frustration. Then he began to hear rumors of a plan to force restoration of the Mars Project, and when a suddenly accelerated training schedule promised to get Dekker back to space, his hopes for the future rose. What he could not know was that the rumored plan would place him in an impossible dilemma - for its success meant the deaths of millions, and failure meant the death of his beloved Mars ...",

It brings a wealth of empirical evidence to bear on how race-sensitive admissions policies actually work and clearly defines the effects they have had on over 45,000 students of different races. Its conclusions mark a turning point in national discussions of affirmative action--anything less than factual evidence will no longer suffice in any serious debate of this vital question.Glenn Loury's new foreword revisits the basic logic behind race-sensitive policies, asserting that since individuals use race to conceptualize themselves, we must be conscious of race as we try to create rules for a just society. Loury underscores the need for confronting opinion with fact so we can better see the distinction between the \"morality of color-blindness\" and the \"morality of racial justice.\"",
