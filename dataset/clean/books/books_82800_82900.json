        "Description": "In the late 1980s, Harley-Davidson beat back an assault by Japanese competitors and engineered a remarkable financial turnaround. But it subsequently faced an even more formidable challenge: maintaining and improving on its success in the absence of an external crisis. To answer this challenge, then-CEO Rich Teerlink, partnering with organizational consultant Lee Ozley, threw out the top-down strategies that had just saved the company and began building a different Harley-one that would be driven not by top management, but by employees at every level. What happened next is the stuff of turnaround legend.More Than a Motorcycle is the story behind the story of the purposeful transformation of an American icon, as told by the two individuals most deeply involved in that decade-long process. The book chronicles the victories and setbacks along Harley's difficult journey from a traditional \"command-and-control\" culture to an open, participative learning environment.Teerlink and Ozley deliver three fundamental messages: people are a company's only sustainable competitive advantage; there is no \"quick fix\" to effect lasting, beneficial organizational change; and leadership is not a person, but a process to which everyone must contribute. They provide practical, reality-tested prescriptions for critical tasks like developing employee alignment, building structures that support participation, and implementing effective reward programs. Finally, they draw lessons from the Harley experience-lessons about values, trust, and community-that apply broadly to any business.An against-the-odds story of a business road less traveled, this book encourages today's leaders to look around the next bend-and to give every employee a view of the road from the driver's seat.",

By day he is a mild-mannered attorney, one who has practiced in a wide variety of legal fields from criminal to corporate to personal injury, earning himself a stellar reputation in the Philadelphia legal community as a hardnosed and astute litigator. By night, his drunken and drug induced escapades are all that keep him going, as he moves from bar to party to bed in the hopes that somehow he can escape the boredom and mental inertia of his job.  Based on the anonymous blog called the Philadelphia Lawyer, HAPPY HOUR IS FOR AMATEURS is a juvenile, raucous, and entertaining memoir that follows the antics of one lawyer in Philadelphia from law school to law practice as he devotes 10 years of his life to one of our country\u2032s most popular yet unsavory professions. Satirizing office culture like never before, his story offers a wry and hilarious look into the monotony of the nine to five workplace and the debauched release that goes on when the sun goes down. Whether it\u2032s dabbling in S&M with buttoned-down career woman, chasing nitrous balloons with shots of Jim Beam, or overdosing on anti-nausea medication for cancer patients to stave off his hangover, HAPPY HOUR IS FOR AMATEURS is episodic escapism in its most enjoyable form, as one man does whatever he can to avoid the unfortunate realities of the law and excruciating tedium of office life.",

Foreign correspondents based in the United States report news and provide context to events that are often unfamiliar or confusing to their readers back home. Unfortunately, there has been too little thoughtful examination of the foreign press in America and its role in the world media. Through Their Eyes fills this void in the unmistakable voice of Stephen Hess, who has been reporting on reporting for over a quarter century.   Globalization is shrinking the planet, making it more important than ever to know what is going on in the world and how those events are being interpreted elsewhere. September 11 was a chilling reminder that how others perceive us does matter, like it or not. Hess seeks to answer three basic yet essential journalistic questions: Who are these U.S.-based foreign correspondents? How do they operate? And perhaps most important, what do they report, and how?   Informed by scores of interviews and armed with original survey research, Hess reveals the mindset of foreign correspondents from a broad sample of countries. He examines how reporting from abroad has changed over the past twenty years and addresses the daunting challenges facing these journalists, ranging from home-office politics to national stereotypes. Unique among works on the subject, this book provides an engaging and humanizing \"Day in the Life?\" section, illustrating how foreign correspondents conduct their daily activities.  This book continues the author's comprehensive Newswork series on the nexus of media, government, and politics. These five books, starting with The Washington Reporters (Brookings, 1981), have become valuable reference materials for all who seek to understand this intersection of journalism and government. Through Their Eyes furthers that rich tradition, making it essential and enjoyable reading.",

        "Description": "From Stephen R. Covey comes a profound, compelling, and groundbreaking book of next-level thinking that gives a clear way to finally tap the limitless value-creation promise of the \u201cKnowledge Worker Age.\u201dIn the more than twenty-five years since its publication, the classic The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People has become an international phenomenon with more than twenty-five million copies sold. Tens of millions of people in business, government, schools, and families, and, most importantly, as individuals, have dramatically improved their lives and organizations by applying the principles of Stephen R. Covey\u2019s classic book. The world, however, is a vastly changed place. Being effective as individuals and organizations is no longer merely an option\u2014survival in today\u2019s world requires it. But in order to thrive, innovate, excel, and lead in what Covey calls the \u201cNew Knowledge Worker Age,\u201d we must build on and move beyond effectiveness. The call of this new era in human history is for greatness; it\u2019s for fulfillment, passionate execution, and significant contribution. Accessing the higher levels of human genius and motivation in today\u2019s new reality requires a change in thinking: a new mindset, a new skill-set, a new tool-set\u2014in short, a whole new habit. The crucial challenge of our world today is this: to find our voice and inspire others to find theirs. It is what Covey calls the 8th Habit. So many people feel frustrated, discouraged, unappreciated, and undervalued\u2014with little or no sense of voice or unique contribution. The 8th Habit is the answer to the soul\u2019s yearning for greatness, the organization\u2019s imperative for significance and superior results, and humanity\u2019s search for its \u201cvoice.\u201d Covey\u2019s new book will transform the way we think about ourselves, our purpose in life, our organizations, and about humankind. Just as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People helped us focus on effectiveness, The 8th Habit shows us the way to greatness.",

        "Description": "The business world is ready for an entirely new approach to leadership.  Steve Farber has written the perfect book to energize business leaders and help them make the leap into extreme leadership.  In fact, taking a giant \"L.E.A.P.\" forward is exactly what Farber prescribes.  What exactly is an extreme leader?  One who cultivates love, generates energy, inspires audacity, and provides proof.            In his exciting and innovative new business parable, The Radical Leap, Farber explores an entirely new leadership model, one in which leaders are not afraid   to take risks, make mistakes in front of employees, or actively solicit employee feedback.  His book dispenses with the typical, tired notions of what it means to be a leader.       Farber, former Vice President and Official Mouthpiece of the Tom Peters Company, has written a business parable like no other, filled with vivid, fully realized, and eccentric characters, crazy plot twists, honest and believable conversations about leadership, and most importantly, an innovative program for leaders to inspire and engage their companies.        In The Radical Leap, we meet Steve, a leadership consultant who is intrigued and challenged by an enigmatic man named Edg, from whom he learns the concept of   L.E.A.P.  Steve is then asked to help a friend, Janice, overcome conflicts at the biotech company where she works and bring back the company's inspiring former CEO.    The company is revitalized, having undergone a radical and successful transformation.       Farber's book reveals the questions leaders must ask themselves in order to truly become extreme leaders, including:      * Why do I love my business, my employees, and my           customers, and how can I show them how I feel?   * What effect do my actions have on the energy of the          people around me?  (OR, what are the unnecessary,          time-consuming, bureaucratic policies and procedures          that suck our energy?)   * How are we going to change the world of our company,          our employees, customers, marketplace, and industry?   * What have I done today to show my commitment to my            colleagues and customers?",

Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most inspiring political drama in the world. Mandela: An Illustrated Autobiography tells the extraordinary story of Nelson Mandela's life, an epic of struggle, setback, renewed hope, and ultimate triumph.With nearly 200 stunning photographs - many of them published here for the first time - and with text adapted from his remarkable memoir Long Walk to Freedom, this moving book captures the indomitable spirit of a moral giant and dramatically portrays his struggle toward freedom. Mandela's journey is vividly and eloquently recounted: the development of his political consciousness, his pivotal role in the formation of the African National Congress Youth League, his years underground - which led to a sentence of life imprisonment in 1964 - and his twenty-seven years behind bars. He also movingly recounts the momentous events leading up to his victory in South Africa's first-ever multiracial elections in 1994.",

One day you might be a famous portrait by Leonardo da Vinci, comfortable in a glass case with admirers all around, and the next you might be carted away for a bath. In a museum, the staff is busy night and day. Guards patrol around the clock to make sure that each work of art is safely in its place. During the day, staff members study works of art, move them from one place to another, and plan shows of paintings and sculpture from around the world. The Nine-Ton Cat takes you along on a day's journey inside the National Gallery, from dawn to dusk, revealing everything from why a museum needs eight hundred keys to how to hoist a nine-ton cat.",

In fact, she and her friends make it a point to avoid all activities considered \"extra-curricular.\" So when her English teacher volunteers her to be an anonymous columnist for the school paper, Luisa's first impulse is to run. But, unlike her high-school dropout sister, Luisa does want to go to college-it may be her only ticket out of a life spent working at the cowboy-themed diner where she waitresses part time-and it would be nice to something on her applications. Her first assignment is to cover her high school's latest fundraiser, which pits the girls against the boys. Luisa will cover the events from the female POV, while another anonymous writer provides the male perspective-or, at least, that's how it begins. The two columnists soon find themselves engaged in an epic battle of the sexes-a battle that Luisa is determined to win. Just who does this guy think he is, encouraging his peers to act like Neanderthals with their girlfriends? And why can't Luisa shake the very sinking feeling that her new unidentified nemesis might also be her new boyfriend?",

        "Description": "Who wouldn't love to put fantastic food on the table--extraordinary pleasures for everyday eating; delicious treats that can be prepared in record time; comfort food that brings family and friends together; luxurious meals that cost barely more than fast food; divine dishes perfect for guests or just for quiet nights at home? Now you can have all that and more with this first-ever collection of 175 of the best recipes from O, The Oprah Magazine. O, The Oprah Magazine Cookbook offers something for everyone--and for all types of occasions, whether you're preparing a feast or looking for a simple dish to satisfy a craving. Appetizers range from an easy-to-make Crostini with Wild Mushrooms and Mozzarella to Crushed Potato with Smoked Salmon, Caviar, and Chives; from elegant Grilled Sea Scallops with Tomato-Black Olive Vinaigrette to delectable Fried Green Tomato Salad with Homemade Ranch Dressing. Inspiration comes from all around the globe, and you can now enjoy at-home dishes such as a tantalizingly bright bowl of Callaloo soup, Moroccan Cinnamon-Rubbed Leg of Lamb, the best Tiramisu ever, an addictive Cuban Grilled Corn on the Cob with Queso Blanco and Lime, and a crazy-delicious New Orleans Creole Gumbo. Desserts include decadent Black Currant-Tea Chocolate Truffles, amazingly simple Chocolate Pots de Cr\u00e8me, Heavenly Fresh Mint Ice Cream, and silky smooth Banana Pudding. Drinks include a Pomegranate Daiquiri and a Strawberry Mint Iced Tea, and a frothy Mexican hot chocolate. Also included are advice on pairings of wine with food and a special index that leads you right to holiday foods, snacks, vegetarian recipes, party favorites, and kid-friendly dishes. Along with the recipes, more than 60 professional chefs and celebrated gourmands provide informative, entertaining, and vibrant lessons and advice about food and cooking--and life. Maya Angelou talks about food as a way to soothe discord, but even more important, as a joyful part of life; Gayle King describes how a true food lover can take equal pleasure from fine dining in a fancy restaurant and a casual burger joint; Marcus Samuelsson explains how travel can expand your palate; Nina Simonds brings home vital lessons from Asia about family dining; Art Smith gives inimitable advice on how to make eating outdoors easy, delicious, and fun. Other wonderful contributions come from Govind Armstrong, Leah Chase, Colin Cowie, Rozanne Gold, Michel Nischan, Susan Spungen, and Rori Trovato. More than a collection of recipes, this book is a guide to enjoying food, elevating every dining experience, and appreciating the special role that cooking and eating can, together, play in our lives.",
