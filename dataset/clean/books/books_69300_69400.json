        "Description": "In About Face, Guido Brunetti and his wife, Paola, are on their way to a dinner party at Palazzo Falier, home of Paola's parents, the rich and powerful Conte and Contessa Falier, While Paola stops to examine a bookstore window, Brunetti's eye is caught by a couple ahead of them in the nearly deserted streets; a woman in an impossibly expensive fur coat on the arm of a much older man. He is intrigued when they turn out to be fellow dinner guests, and even more so when he sees the woman's face, which has been disfigured by excessive plastic surgery. She is Franca Marinello, La Superliftata, whom he's heard of but never met.This intelligent, mysterious woman entrances Brunetti. When she visits him later at the Questura and asks a favor, he is troubled. Her request seems to land near his investigation into a suspicious death that looks like murder, and the illegal hauling of garbage. In Italy, the environment has reached a crisis. Incinerators across the south are at full capacity, burning who-knows-what, the polluted waters of Venice's canals sit in the shadow of a major chemical complex, and in Naples, enormous piles of garbage grow in the streets.As Brunetti delves into this shadowy, toxic world, he comes face to face with violence as dangerous as he's ever seen, and corruption that touches on his influential father-in-law, as well as the fascinating Franca Marinello.",

        "Title": "The House at Riverton: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Morton, Kate",
        "Description": "From the #1 internationally bestselling author of The Forgotten Garden comes a gorgeous novel set in England between World War I and World war II. Perfect for fans of Downton Abbey, it is the story of an aristocratic family, a house, a mysterious death and a way of life that vanished forever, told in flashback by a woman who witnessed it all and kept a secret for decades.Grace Bradley went to work at Riverton House as a servant when she was just a girl, before the First World War. For years her life was inextricably tied up with the Hartford family, most particularly the two daughters, Hannah and Emmeline. In the summer of 1924, at a glittering society party held at the house, a young poet shot himself. The only witnesses were Hannah and Emmeline and only they\u2014and Grace\u2014know the truth. In 1999, when Grace is ninety-eight years old and living out her last days in a nursing home, she is visited by a young director who is making a film about the events of that summer. She takes Grace back to Riverton House and reawakens her memories. Told in flashback, this is the story of Grace's youth during the last days of Edwardian aristocratic privilege shattered by war, of the vibrant twenties and the changes she witnessed as an entire way of life vanished forever. The novel is full of secrets\u2014some revealed, others hidden forever, reminiscent of the romantic suspense of Daphne du Maurier. It is also a meditation on memory, the devastation of war and a beautifully rendered window into a fascinating time in history. Kate Morton\u2019s first novel, originally published to critical acclaim in Australia, and quickly becoming a #1 bestseller in England, The House at Riverton is a vivid, page-turning novel of suspense and passion, with characters\u2014and an ending\u2014readers won't soon forget.",

The society's world-renowned cartographers, working with education consultants and geographers have created a state-of-the-art world atlas for children ages 5 to 8. Large, easy-to-read maps introduce youngsters to the world and each of its continents. Full-color photographs, carefully selected for their appeal to young children, supplement the maps and make people, places, and natural wonders come to life. Through simple but fact-filled text, children begin exploring the world by learning about maps and how to read them. Then they begin their continent-by-continent tour. Each continent begins with a welcome from a young native child, followed by an illustrated physical map with brief bulleted discussions of land regions, water, climate, plants, and animals. Similar treatment is given to the political map except the topics are countries, cities, people, languages, and products. Each spread features full-color images that are keyed to the maps. Backmatter includes a map keyed to a chart of geographic superlatives, a glossary, a pronunciation guide, and an index.",

When he demanded her help recovering a stolen diary, she dared not refuse him. When he proposed they masquerade as a betrothed couple, loyalty forced her to agree. And when the restraint between them shattered and pleasure became an obsession, Mary had to trust a powerful man who could send her to the gallows ... or love her through eternity.",

Your parents get completely bizarre when the subject of dating comes up. A friend you've had forever stabs you in the back for no good reason. Everybody you know seems to feel free to comment on your constantly changing body. Drugs and alcohol go from being what you see \"bad\" kids doing on television shows to what you see your friends doing when no adults are around. How are you supposed to deal?  Since life doesn't come with a set of instructions, it helps to turn to people who have been through the stuff that you're facing. Even parents can help. (Really!) In Boys Will Put You on a Pedestal (so they can look up your skirt), former teenage boy -- and current dad of two daughters -- Philip Van Munching helps guide you through some of life's most confusing topics. From Beauty to Grief, from Sex to Fate, Van Munching covers the things you most want to know about and, in his wise, warm, and funny way, offers advice on how you can become the young woman you most want to be.",

Here, in the wealth-studded hills of Jefferson County, Virginia, even evil rides a mount.The all-important New Year\u2019s Hunt commences amid swirling light snow. It is the last formal hunt of the season; therefore, participation is required no matter how hungover riders are from toasting the midnight before. On this momentous occasion, \u201cSister\u201d Jane Arnold, master of the foxhounds, announces her new joint master and the new president of the Jefferson Hunt. And her choices will prove to be no less than shocking.The day\u2019s festivities are quickly marred, though, by what appears on the surface to be an unrelated tragedy. Sam Lorillard, former shining star and Harvard Law School alum, lies dead of a stab wound on a baggage cart at the old train station, surrounded by the outcasts and vagabonds who composed his social circle at the end of life. No one can remember when Sam started drinking, but the downward spiral was swift\u2013and seemingly deadly. Murder is followed by scandal when Sister Jane discovers dishonest hunting practices going on in a neighboring club. Unsure whether to turn a blind eye or report the infringement to the proper authority, Sister and her huntsman, Shaker Crown, decide to investigate a little further, with the help of their trusty hounds. But when they come a little too close to the staggering truth\u2013and uncover an unforeseen connection to Lorillard\u2019s murder\u2013they realize they might not survive to see the next New Year\u2019s Hunt.Intricate, witty, and full of the varied voices of creatures both great and small, Full Cry is an astute reminder that even those with the bluest of blood still bleed red.",

Internationally inspired, these recipes include such delectable marinades as Adobo, Jamaican Jerk, Sake Teriyaki and Polynesian Passi on Fruit and Rum to tickle palates up and down the taste spectrum. In addition to the recipes, Barnard also offers practical grilling advice and tips on pairing foods with marinades.   Grilling is one of the best ways to add flavor to food without adding fat. As evidenced by the explosive demand for fancy grills, fuels and flammable additives such as mesquite and hickory, today&#39;s backyard barbecuing has outgrown shriveled hotdogs and charred chicken. For the legions of Americans hungry for the perfect barbecue, Marinades is the final, most important ingredient.",
