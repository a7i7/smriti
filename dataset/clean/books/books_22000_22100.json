        "Description": "Why seek outside answers when you already possess the resources and power you need? In a world moving faster than ever, the challenge to stay connected to others, your visions, and yourself is great.The Tiny Warrior teaches how to look inward and find strength by learning to use your warrior spirit. In Native American traditions, warriors had a creed \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to develop themselves as assets to the village they served. Your \"village\" can be your family, community, company, clients, or the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201d anyone you serve. The warrior concept transcends race, gender, or age.Noted Native American speaker turned author D. J. Eagle Bear Vanas uses wisdom from his Odawa Indian roots and his path as an officer in the U.S. Air Force and later as an entrepreneur to interweave the Native tradition of storytelling with practical key bits of knowledge to live and learn by. By following Vanas's direction, you can develop your talent and ability to better serve and defend others. As a bonus, Vanas includes \"Reflections and Breakthroughs\" space at the end of the book for you to record your own revelations on each chapter.",

        "Description": "The true story of how the search for an heir to one of Tibet's high lamas became a battle for the country's future. In May 1995, a seven-year-old Tibetan boy, along with his parents and younger brother, was taken from his home by Chinese security services. Neither the boy nor his family has been seen since. His devotees believe him to be the eleventh incarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second most important incarnation in the Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy. In The Search for the Panchen Lama, Isabel Hilton tells the enthralling inside story of how this boy became the innocent prize in a battle between the Chinese regime and the Dalai Lama. Starting with the death of the last Panchen Lama, she describes the intrigue surrounding the race to choose Tibet's future religious leader, a decision of enormous importance in the politically charged climate of Tibet. Traveling from the Dalai Lama's headquarters in India to all-but-inaccessible monasteries and villages in the Himalayas, Hilton probes beneath the surface of a society living grudgingly under Chinese rule. Throughout, she balances her taut narrative against the fascinating history of Tibet's high lamas, illuminating the unique role religion has played in shaping Tibetan culture and Tibet's uneasy relationship with China. Combining history, travel, and politics, The Search for the Panchen Lama offers an extraordinarily gripping and original window on to a fascinating land.",

Now, the princess and Jean Sasson turn the spotlight on Sultana's two teenage daughters, Maha and Amani. During her own youth, Sultana chafed under the harsh social system into which she was born. Today, despite untold wealth and privilege, Princess Sultana cannot buy the rights and freedoms women in other cultures possess, for herself, or for her daughters. Although Sultana lives with a constant fear of retribution--even death at the hand of her own father or brother, her passion to provide her two daughters with a better life transcends her fear and fuels her desire for change.As second-generation members of the royal family who have benefited from Saudi oil wealth, Maha and Amani have known nothing but opulence and wealth from the moment of their birth. Yet, stilled by the unbearable restrictive lifestyle imposed on them, Maha and Amani have reacted in equally desperate ways.Maha is a headstrong beauty driven by fear and isolation due to Saudi Arabia's feudal justice. Described by her father as a girl of brilliant fragments, Maha's gifted mind cannot focus on one goal. When Maha becomes involved in a lesbian relationship, she ends having an emotional breakdown and requires psychiatric treatment in London. Amani, the youngest daughter, rebels in her way during the religious frenzy of Haj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Makkah. Once a sweet and placid animal-lover, Amani emerges almost overnight from her dormant religious faith and embraces Islamic beliefs with unnerving intensity. Amani's fundamental fanaticism threatens to destroy her mother's personal quest to imporove women's lot in her native land. With candor and humility, Sultana shares the joy, frustration, and dark intervals of my fear of Saudi Arabian motherhood and marriage. She details the difficulties inherent in raising d",

Lina Ray has a knack for pairing up perfect couples as a professional matchmaker in San Francisco, but her well-meaning, highly traditional Indian family wants her to get married. When her Auntie Kiki introduces Lina to the bachelor from hell at her sister's wedding in India, Lina panics and blurts out, \"I'm engaged!\" Because what's the harm in a little lie? Who's sari now? Lina scrambles to find a real fianc\u00e9 because Auntie Kiki will be coming to America soon to approve the match. But date after disastrous date gets her no closer to her prince -- until an actual prince arrives on her doorstep. Lina hasn't been able to stop fantasizing about traditional but dashing Raja Prasad since she met him in India. In fact, her imaginary fianc\u00e9 has begun to resemble him! Now Raja is in San Francisco and wants Lina to find a suitable bride for his brother. Though they live oceans apart, Lina longs to bridge the gap. But when her fantastic fib catches up with her, life is suddenly like a Bollywood flick gone horribly wrong.

Only fifteen years later, that number had jumped to an incredible 68,064. The last few decades have indeed witnessed the rise of the \"$1 Million a Year\" American. The rich are getting richer, and more people are joining their ranks, but the lower income echelon is not dwindling. One in five children currently live in households where the annual income is below $15,000.Hacker uses his mastery with statistics and authoritative analysis to show how a changing economy is affecting our lives and how, in turn, our decisions are changing the shape of the economy. And he looks ahead, confronting our greatest uncertainties about our futures and the futures of our children. Shattering all the taboos we have on the subjects of wealth, poverty, worth, and greed, Money is essential reading for anyone who wants to know more about their slice of the American pie.",

Thunder Point opens at the Fuhrer Bunker in Berlin, the day before Adolf Hitler's suicide. The Fuhrer arranges for Reichsleiter Martin Bormann to flee Germany by air to Norway, where a German U-boat waits to take him to South America....1992. Sean Dillon, the elusive terrorist from Eye of the Storm, is facing a firing squad in war-torn Yugoslavia. He is saved at the last minute by his old nemesis, Brigadier Charles Ferguson - head of Group Four, the British prime minister's personal action unit. In exchange for his salvation, Dillon must take on a \"black job\" for Ferguson in the Caribbean. The wreck of the German U-boat has been discovered at Thunder Point, off St. John in the American Virgin Islands. In the U-boat is a diary kept by the captain, as well as the contents of the watertight briefcase Martin Bormann had with him on that fateful trip. The papers not only name important members of the British establishment and Parliament who were Nazi sympathizers, but also contain the Windsor Protocol - a document signed by the Duke of Windsor himself in which he undertook to ascend the British throne on the successful invasion of Britain by German forces in 1940.Ferguson and the prime minister are determined that Britain and the royal family be spared the horrific embarrassment of these discoveries. But other individuals, including someone high within the British government itself, are determined to find out the secrets of Bormann's briefcase for their own sinister reasons.Sweeping from England to the Caribbean and back with ever-growing momentum, Thunder Point brings together a remarkable set of heroes and villains in the most desperate struggle of their lives. It is a complex, brilliantly executed story of high-explosive secrets, war, and danger.In the past, readers have compared Higgins' work with his legendary The Eagle Has Landed. Now there will be a new standard: Thunder Point - without a doubt the master's finest novel yet.",

While kids are learning painlessly about how to make verbs agree with their subjects and pronouns with their antecedents, they look at some of the wackier words in the English language and see how they are often misused.

Escaping the misery of a particularly sweltering August in Aleford, Massachusetts, caterer and minister's wife Faith Fairchild and her family take a long drive to their favorite getaway, peaceful Sanpere Island off the coast of Maine. But things have changed since their last visit. The unique ambience of Sanpere is being threatened by aggressive real estate developer Harold Hapswell, whose plans to fill the island with huge, showy new mansions has infuriated many residents. Tensions are high, with animosity between year-round islanders and \"summer people\" reaching dangerous new levels. It's no wonder that, in an atmosphere so thick with ill feeling, murder rears its ugly head.The first outrage occurs when a successful real estate agent nearly dies after drinking a turpentine-laced cup of soda pop. Then, while exploring the grounds of Sanpere's historic, now-abandoned lighthouse, Faith has the misfortune of stumbling across the corpse of Harold Hapswell himself. His death is officially ruled an accident, but Faith's tried-and-true instincts tell her otherwise -- an unsettling inkling that is confirmed by the discovery of a second, more obvious homicide.With fear running rampant throughout the island and volatile emotions approaching the detonation point, the intrepid amateur investigator knows she must throw caution to the wind and track down a murderer, for the sake of an innocent friend and the island she loves -- even if it means placing her own life in peril.",

Yet, he gets to her more than any other man ever has.  But though Lucas may be a scientist, he's the rock star of scientists. His inventions have made him millions, his research is reshaping the study of medicine and he holds patents for numerous technological marvels.  But now, when it means everything, he's failed.  His younger brother, the family's 'golden child' is dying of cancer and Lucas, despite his brilliance, can't help him. In Chandler, he tries to hide from the world he knows. Mike tried running away from her problems when she was a kid.  When her mother lay dying, Mike ran.  When her world crumbled, Mike hid.  And she's learned that the only way to win is to stand your ground and keep trying.  She doesn't understand what Lucas is talking about half the time, but she knows exactly what he's feeling.  And while criticizing his complete lack of architectural ability, and remaking the house he's trying to build, Mike finds herself slipping into Lucas Gallagher's life.  She wakes him up and he shakes her up: the two of them are complete opposites, and nothing can keep them apart. Until Lucas's brother Justin comes home to die.",

Yet there is another story of that glorious, bloody movement that still lies buried: the courageous women who sparked the revolution by taking to the streets. Now, in her most splendid, thought-provoking novel yet, Marge Piercy brings to vibrant life three of the women who played prominent roles in the most tumultuous turning point in European history, and tells the intimate stories of the men whose names we know so well.Claire Lacombe escapes the grinding poverty of Pamiers by joining a traveling theatrical troupe as an actress. Defiantly independent, strikingly beautiful, she will become a symbol to many as she tests her theory: if men can make things happen, perhaps women can too. . . . Manon Philipon, a jeweler's daughter, worships Rousseau and the life of the mind. When she marries Jean Roland, a minor provincial bureaucrat, she finds she has a talent for politics--albeit as the ghostwriter of her husband's speeches, and the hostess of his salon. . . . Pauline L\u00e9on, owner of a chocolate shop in Paris, witnesses the torture and executions of common people who riot for bread. As the revolution gathers momentum, Pauline is certain of one thing: the women must apply the pressure, or their male colleagues will let them starve. And so the Revolutionary Republican Women are born. . . . And while the women make their voices heard in every district, the men sit in makeshift assemblies, willing the revolution into being through infighting and intrigue. The incorruptible Maximilien Robespierre, the earthy and opportunistic Georges Danton, and the intellectual Nicholas Condorcet all vie for power as Paris whips itself into a frenzy. History has recorded their political legacies, but in City of Darkness, City of Light Marge Piercy reveals the innermost thoughts and feelings of these three men, their insecurities and vulnerabilities, the way they loved and sometimes lost what was most precious to them.The women's march on Versailles. The haggling of the Committee for Public Safety. The overarching reach of the Terror. All the events of the revolution explode with the urgency of today's headlines, as Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Marat, Tom Paine, Camille Desmoulins, Olympe de Gouges, and many other legendary figures play their parts on the great stage of history. Marge Piercy has done nothing less than capture the entire sweep of the French Revolution, while opening to us the minds and hearts of six people who changed the world, lived their ideals--and were prepared to die for them. Filled with the philosophy, politics, and dreams of these extraordinary women and men, City of Darkenss, City of Light is Marge Piercy's masterpiece.",

Vidal's splendid and percipient prose animates key moments of decision in the birthing of our nation, and we come to know these men in ways we have not until now - their opinions of each other, their worries about money, their concerns about creating a viable democracy. Vidal brings them to life and illuminates the force and weight of the documents they wrote, the speeches they gave, and the institutions of government they fashioned. Above all, Inventing a Nation presents a powerful, compassionate, immensely moving portrait of George Washington, whose resolution, integrity, and intelligence rescued the fledgling Republic many times in its early days.",

The answer: Welch implemented a tough but flexible agenda that contained some of the very best business ideas corporate America had ever seen. What if you could take some of those ideas and apply them to your own corporation, your own management style? What if you knew the secret to Jack Welch's success?Get Better or Get Beaten! examines 31 of those secrets in a fast-paced, easy-to-digest format that reads like a \"manager's little instruction book.\" Here are the personal beliefs, bywords, principles, and techniques that helped Jack Welch become the most respected CEO in America.",

Most organizations still rely on patriarchy and hierarchy as their core form of governance, stifling initiative and spirit and alienating people from the work they do. Peter Block asserts that a fundamental shift in how we distribute power, privilege, and the control of money can transform every part of an organization for the better, and he examines the nitty-gritty of implementing these reforms.  This revised and expanded edition includes a new introduction by Block addressing what has and hasn\u2019t changed since the first edition and a new chapter on applying stewardship to the common good of the wider community.

So when the exquisitely pneumatic and extraordinarily wealthy Sylvia Triumphington, adored adoptive heiress to the Triumphington family fortune, sets her sights on him, Stephen is taken by surprise.In marrying into the Triumphington millions, however, Stephen gets rather more than he bargained for. If it were just the gorgeous Sylvia, with her unexpected enthusiasm for rough sex, her obsession with finding her real mother, and her tendency to spend Stephen's nonexistent money rather than draw a cent from her own, presumably overflowing, coffers, things would be fine. But there is also her arrogant and unpredictable adoptive father, who responds rather badly to any request for a handout. And then there is Sylvia's elegant, insatiable adoptive mother Drusilla, to whom Stephen finds himself inconveniently and conspicuously attracted.",
