        "Description": "Over half a million copies sold! From the author of the highly acclaimed heavy metal memoir, Fargo Rock City, comes another hilarious and discerning take on massively popular culture\u2014set in Chuck Klosterman\u2019s den and your own\u2014covering everything from the effect of John Cusack flicks to the crucial role of breakfast cereal to the awesome power of the Dixie Chicks.Countless writers and artists have spoken for a generation, but no one has done it quite like Chuck Klosterman. With an exhaustive knowledge of popular culture and an almost effortless ability to spin brilliant prose out of unlikely subject matter, Klosterman attacks the entire spectrum of postmodern America: reality TV, Internet porn, Pamela Anderson, literary Jesus freaks, and the real difference between apples and oranges (of which there is none). And don\u2019t even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation.  Whether deconstructing Saved by the Bell episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of The Empire Strikes Back or the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, he\u2019ll make you laugh, and he\u2019ll drive you insane\u2014usually all at once. Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, politics, and kittens, but\u2014really\u2014it\u2019s about us. All of us. As Klosterman realizes late at night, in the moment before he falls asleep, \u201cIn and of itself, nothing really matters. What matters is that nothing is ever \u2018in and of itself.\u2019\u201d Read to believe.",

        "Description": "The rise, fall, and rebirth of Richard Nixon is perhaps the most fascinating story in American politics. Presidential chronicles and other outside sources have tried to capture it in full, but Nixon: A Life is the first to succeed. Nixon: A Life is the first entirely objective biography of Richard Nixon. Jonathan Aitken, who, in addition to serving in Parliament, serves as Her Majesty's Minister of State for Defense, conducted over sixty hours of interviews with Nixon and was granted unprecedented access to thousands of pages of Nixon's previously sealed private documents. The results of Aitken's interviews and research shed new light on a presidency that is just now beginning to be understood by serious students of history. Among the questions Aitken answers with fresh insight are: . Why didn't Nixon burn the Watergate tapes? How did he achieve his astonishing comebacks after being defeated by Kennedy in 1960 and resigning from the presidency in 1974? What were his relationships with political figures such as Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, and personal friends such as Bebe Rebozo and Robert Abplanalp? What caused him to overcome his doubts and pursue the Alger Hiss spy case in Congress? What are Nixon's innermost spiritual beliefs and intellectual influences? What drives him now? Previously published in Great Britain to rave reviews, Nixon: A Life is the first Nixon biography written by a non-American author. Aitken's refreshingly unencumbered positions on Watergate and Vietnam provide a unique perspective on Nixon's life and his presidency. Nixon: A Life breaks important new ground as a major work of political biography. It is a work that will inspire historiansto recognize the outstanding diplomatic achievements of a man whose journey from tainted politician to respected foreign policy expert and elder statesman has been nothing short of remarkable.",

But their quiet hotel has guests other than those on the register, and a vacation intended to distract them from the present instead becomes a chilling confrontation with the past. Selway, an escapist with an alcoholic history and a gift for prescience, is drawn into a series of encounters with the ghost of a young girl who died in a fall from the same hotel sixty years earlier. Gradually, the shadowy rooms and characters of her life - and the nightmarish circumstances of her death - grow more real to him than those of this own, and he relishes the chance to move from his lackluster reality into her troubled history. Selway's wife looks on helplessly, then hopelessly, as her husband withdraws into a darkness whose inhabitants she cannot see or touch. Their marriage begins to crumble, and suddenly the lives of those around them are also in great jeopardy.",

        "Description": "The Upstart is a new historical novel from Catherine Cookson set amidst the roiling social currents of rural England at the turn of the century. Risen to power and influence, Samuel Fairbrother, a shrewd and newly monied manufacturer and retailer of boots, shoes, and clogs, has decided that his new station in life deserves a more imposing residence. When a thirty-four-room mansion on the outskirts of Fellburn becomes available, he snaps up the estate without hesitation and establishes himself as the owner of the property he sees as the emblem of his wealth and a suitable reward for his new, exalted status in the business world. Along with the house, however, Fairbrother inherits the services of a staff of servants headed by Maitland, the butler, who makes no effort to disguise his disdain for his new boss.So begins a clash of wills between master and man, in which Samuel Fairbrother soon realizes he is at a distinct disadvantage. Not only is Maitland urbane and apparently well educated, he is ingenious at maintaining a position of indispensability. Fairbrother is all too aware that he dare not do without Maitland's services and is forced to conclude that he will never win this conflict. And so an uneasy truce is declared between them.As the years go by and the century turns, Fairbrother witnesses his children, one by one, leave the big house and make lives of their own - all except his eldest daughter, Janet, who by means of a legacy is able to shape the destiny of her father's scattered family and effect the reconciliation that he thought was impossible.",

A talented seamstress and designer, she is cursed with a semiretired hooker for a mother, a hypochondriac for a sister, a no-good loafer for a brother-in-law, a frog-collecting grandma, and Momma&#39;s British lesbian friends, Muff and Freda Bottrell--\"Clairvoyants and Tea Leaf Readers Extraordinaire.\" To make matters worse, Darla lives in Paradise, a drought-ridden bend in the road that&#39;s spitting distance from Lamb of God Pentecostal Church and Big Bucks Bingo--a world away from where she wants to be, New York City. But Darla is blessed with the devotion of Elijah True, an elderly black man who nurtured her through childhood; the friendship of Brandy, the town&#39;s lonely beautician; and the unexpected love of the Reverend Spirit E. Jackson, a transplanted Australian who drives into town in an old white Cadillac and sweeps her off her feet.   Sadly, as Darla formulates her plan to escape Paradise, turmoil erupts. Family once more stands between her and her suitcase. Momma runs off with a long-distance trucker, Darla&#39;s sister is hospitalized with cancer, her sister&#39;s two children are sick with worry, and brother-in-law Frank is thrown in jail--charged with impregnating a neighbor&#39;s sixteen-year-old daughter. Left unsupervised, Granny gets into trouble of her own, and Pearl, Darla&#39;s fourteen-year-old niece, can&#39;t cope with her world. Torn between her love for Spirit, her love for Elijah and young Jesse, her keen sense of duty, and the pursuit of a dream, Darla must, for the first time in her life, cast an unflinching eye on all the hard-to-accept truths regarding love, responsibility, and survival.   The Bingo Queens of Paradise is a tour-de-force first novel that lyrically blends a powerful comic voice with a poignant tale of a woman who longs to escape her life and follow her dreams.",

Charging Elk, an Oglala Sioux, joins Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show   and journeys from the Black Hills of South Dakota to the back streets of nineteenth-century   Marseille. Left behind in a Marseille hospital after a serious injury while the show   travels on, he is forced to remake his life alone in a strange land. He struggles   to adapt as well as he can, while holding on to the memories and traditions of life   on the Plains and eventually falling in love. But none of the worlds the Indian has   known can prepare him for the betrayal that follows. This is a story of the American   Indian that we have seldom seen: a stranger in a strange land, often an invisible   man, loving, violent, trusting, wary, protective, and defenseless against a society   that excludes him but judges him by its rules. At once epic and intimate, The Heartsong   of Charging Elk echoes across time, geography, and cultures.",

Cate escapes to her beloved garden and Hana reads and writes letters.  Each find themselves drawn into their pasts, remembering the joyous and challenging events that have shaped them: spending the day at Max's favorite beach, overcoming their neighbors' prejudices that Max is Japanese-American and Cate is Italian-American, and coping with the heartbreak of discovering Hana's disease.One of the great joys of Hana's life has been her relationship with her beautiful, successful best friend Laura.  Laura has moved to New York from their hometown in California and has two daughters, Josephine and Camille.  She has not been home in years and begs Hana to let her bring her daughters to meet her, feeling that Josephine, in particular, needs to have Hana in her life.  Despite Hana's latest refusal, Laura decides to come anyway.  When Laura's loud, energetic, and troubled world collides with Hana and Cate's daily routine, the story really begins.Dreaming Water is about a mother's courage, a daughter's strength, and a friend's love.

Bob and Melinda survey the wreckage of their beloved restaurant and wonder whether leaving Anguilla, with its innumerable challenges, would be any easier than walking out on each other.
