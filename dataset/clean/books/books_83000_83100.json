        "Description": "The centuries-long complexity of China's political experience, the richness of its culture, and the drama of its economic unfolding are the hallmarks of this short but sweeping history. China's own history is entwined with its response to the West in a rich tapestry depicting its peoples, rulers, and society. More than a nuanced history of a vast continent, this study is sensitive to the multifaceted and changing interpretations of China that have been offered over the years. In this overarching book, J. A. G. Roberts refers to recent archeological finds--the caches of bronze vessels found at Sanxingdui--and to new documentary reevaluations--the reassessment of Manchu documentation. The first half of the book provides an up-to-date interpretation of China's early and imperial history, while the second half concentrates on the modern period and provides an interpretive account of major developments--the impact of Western imperialism, the rise of Chinese Communism, and the record of the People's Republic of China since 1949.Concise and direct, this book is a compelling narrative and handy companion for those interested in China.",

Like most women, Valerie spent most of her conscious life on a diet, thinking about a diet, ignoring a diet, or failing on a diet. At age eleven, her mother put Val on her first weight-loss program. As a teen, she was enrolled in Weight Watchers (for which she invented creative ditching methods). As a young woman, her world felt right only when she was able to zip a certain pair of jeans. Not wanting to pass this legacy on to her own daughters, Valerie set out to cleanse herself of her obsession. Thin Is the New Happy is the true story of one woman's quest to exorcise her bad body-image demons, to uncover the truths behind what put them there, and to learn how to truly love herself.",

Even if you can\u2019t define it, you speak it every day through your postures, gestures, facial expressions, and tone of voice, and you must constantly read these same signals from others. In fact, nonverbal messages can carry up to 90% of the meaning of human interaction and contribute significantly to social, academic, and professional success.Yet even though we recognize the importance of nonverbal communication, we have generally left the teaching of this essential language to chance. Now parents and teachers can help children develop nonverbal skills so that they will be able to communicate more effectively and to interact with others more successfully.In Teaching Your Child the Language of Social Success, clinical psychologists Marshall Duke and Stephen Nowicki and educator Elixabeth Martin describe and explain the methods and rules of nonverbal communication. Together they have created an easy-to-use guide which offers definitions and techniques for assessing a child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in this unspoken realm, as well as case studies, illustrations, and exercises for teaching or improving nonverbal skills at home or in the classroom.",

        "Title": "More: Population, Nature, and What Women Want",
        "Authors": "By Engelman, Robert",
        "Description": "In the capital of Ghana, a teenager nicknamed \u201cCondom Sister\u201d trolls the streets to educate other young people about contraception. Her work and her own aspirations point to a remarkable shift not only in the West African nation, where just a few decades ago women had nearly seven children on average, but around the globe. While world population continues to grow, family size keeps dropping in countries as diverse as Switzerland and South Africa. The phenomenon has some lamenting the imminent extinction of humanity, while others warn that our numbers will soon outgrow the planet\u2019s resources. Robert Engelman offers a decidedly different vision\u2014one that celebrates women\u2019s widespread desire for smaller families. Mothers aren\u2019t seeking more children, he argues, but more for their children. If they\u2019re able to realize their intentions, we just might suffer less climate change, hunger, and disease, not to mention sky-high housing costs and infuriating traffic jams. In More, Engelman shows that this three-way dance between population, women\u2019s autonomy, and the natural world is as old as humanity itself. He traces pivotal developments in our history that set population\u2014and society\u2014on its current trajectory, from hominids\u2019 first steps on two feet to the persecution of \u201cwitches\u201d in Europe to the creation of modern contraception. Both personal and sweeping, More explores how population growth has shaped modern civilization\u2014and humanity as we know it. The result is a mind-stretching exploration of parenthood, sex, and culture through the ages. Yet for all its fascinating historical detail, More is primarily about the choices we face today. Whether society supports women to have children when and only when they choose to will not only shape their lives, but the world all our children will inherit.",

        "Description": "OUR OWN WORST ENEMY provides a solid, practical, logical approach to personal security for all Americans and explains why the government is not prepared to help us in a time of crisis (Katrina, 9/11, etc.).  Leading homeland security expert Randall J. Larsen details what we must do as citizens to protect ourselves, our families and our assets.  The key, Larsen argues, is finally asking the right questions about homeland security, such as:-\"How do we prevent a terrorist organization from becoming a nuclear power?\"  The media frequently poses the question: \"What can we do to ensure that al Qaeda does not smuggle a nuclear weapon into the U.S. through one of our ports?\"  But the right question should focus on prevention -- and the answer is far different from the discussion that dominates the debate and the spending priorities of the Bush Administration and Congress.-\"Who should be in charge of logistics during a major disaster?\"  Larsen says that it's not the military. The fact is, no one is better at logistics than American businesses such as FedEx, UPS, and Target.  OUR OWN WORST ENEMY states that the government should encourage citizens and businesses to be active and learn to \"posse up\" while looking to the private sector to provide food, water, shelter, and transportation during a natural or man-made crisis.Larsen offers a strong combination of practical advice (Did you know a $1 mask can save your life in the event of a dirty bomb?) and wise examination of such key issues as the economy, borders and immigration, national health care, personal security, and more.",

The turbulence of that era has left us with extraordinary tales that serve as a reminder of the heroism displayed and the torture endured by the soldiers of both sides. A man from Harper's Ferry, bearing a striking resemblance to John Brown, is often asked to pose for photographs; but his image never appears when they are developed. The ghost of a murdered captain appears before his colonel and reveals who did the killing. A reenactment of J. E. B. Stuart's famous ride becomes a frightening reality as one man witnesses his great grandfather's fall in battle a hundred years prior. These, and other legends, uniquely blend suspense, mystery, and history.",

The Fortune Encyclopedia of Economics, the only work of its kind, lifts the veil of mystery from economics and takes you on a user-friendly journey through this fascinating and important field.Respected economist David R. Henderson has brought together the most brilliant minds in economics, including Nobel Prize winners, scholars, presidential advisors, and financial columnists. Each expert addresses issues within his or her field in essays that are colorful as well as instructive.Chapters range from \"Basic Concepts\" to \"Economic Regulation\" and \"Corporations and Financial Markets.\" Within each chapter are alphabetically arranged topics such as advertising, benefit-cost analysis, federal deficit, entrepreneurship, inflation, junk bonds, property rights, rent control, and electric utility regulation. Essays are cross-referenced to other relevant chapters. In addition, an extensive biographical section has detailed profiles of the men and women who shaped economic thinking throughout history.From Thomas W. Hazlett's review of apartheid to Gerald W. Scully's discussion of the special market of sports, from a lucid description of protectionism to an explanation of what moves stock prices the more than 150 topics are surprising in their range and broad relevance. And from the theories of John Maynard Keynes to current controversies about Clinton's economics, the issues examined in this book will both answer specific questions quickly and provide a lifetime of rewarding reading.",

        "Title": "Der Payatz: Around the World with Yiddish Theater",
        "Authors": "By Yablokoff, Herman",
        "Description": "Herman Yablokoff was a master of his craft. He was an actor, singer, songwriter, playwright, director and producer in a world that has virtually disappeared. In Der Payatz, his autobiography, Yablokoff the showman stages a vivid recreation of his times. The result is breathtaking and captivating as Yablokoff, with genuine theatrical style offers the story of his life. He introduces himself in 1960. In Warsaw, Poland for a concert tour, Yablokoff attempts to enter the Soviet Union to visit his father's grave. He then relates the story of growing up in Grondo early in this century. With fascinating detail he reconstructs the vibrant Jewish life of the city. The synagogues, schools, people and his family's struggle for existence all come to life again. Yablokoff's love for the theater began at an early age as he became acquainted with the visiting Yiddish troupes that came to town. He soon began to perform in children's roles. Restricted from performing in Yiddish, these groups would deliver their lines in that language until warned by a lookout to revert to Russian. After a stint in the Polish Army, as a musician, Yablokoff, still a teenager, joined a group of Yiddish performers traveling in Lithuania. In 1924, he arrived in America. Immigration had recently been restricted. On Ellis Island, officials, amazed at his youth, greeted with skepticism his claim that he was an accomplished actor. Remarkably, a board of inquiry invited him to audition and his performance was awarded with entrance to the United States. He toured with stock companies in the U.S. and Canda and struggled to gain entrance to the tightly controlled Hebrew Actors Union. Herman Yablokoff was not an instant success, but he eventually began his climb to the top of his profession. Songs like \"Papirossen\" became international standards. Another of his well-known Yiddish melodies, \"Shveig Mein Hartz\" was plagiarized into the popular hit \"Nature Boy.\" And Yablokoff went on the radio, known only as the mysterious \"Der Payatz\" -- the Clown. His original compositions and unique story telling in song became widely popular and proved to be the turning point in his career. Soon he was not only starring, but producing, directing and writing his own shows, showcasing Yiddish performers such as Aaron Lebedeff, Maurice Schwartz and Menasha Skulnik. In 1947, in the midst of a hectic schedule, he sought and obtained permission to entertain the remnants of European Jewry, still in the \"Displaced Persons\" camps. For months he traveled from camp to camp offering a song, some laughter and tears, to lighten the hearts of those who had suffered so much. He considered it the most gratifying experience of his life. It was in one of the camps that he discovered his niece, Dora, the only survivor of his family in Grodno. Yablokoff's travels continued to take him around the world, wherever Jews were found. He entertained in South America, Israel, Scandinavia, even in Cuba. All the lush details of these places, the sights, sounds and people are here to savor. Originally published in Yiddish, Der Payatz was translated by Bella Mysell, Yablokoff's wife and herself a star of the Yiddish stage. They were a popular team for many years. Herman Yablokoff died in 1981, and the Yiddish culture in which he thrived had already largely vanished. But he leaves an enduring look at that culture. The master showman captures all the drama and excitement of the world in which he lived, giving us a riveting picture of a time that no longer exists. So have a seat, turn the page, the curtain is going up on another Yablokoff production.",

And now,   for all those spellbound by the tale of Prince Tristan, heir to the throne of Eutracia,   his twin sister Princess Shailiha, the ancient wizard Wigg, and the fate of their   enchanted land, there is indeed more\u2014much more\u2014to be told. . . . For three centuries, Eutracia was a kingdom at peace, ruled by a benevolent monarchy   and guided by a council of wizards. But a horror from the past, long believed vanquished,   returned with devastating fury. And when the battle against the bloodthirsty Sorceresses   of the Coven was finally won, victory was not without its price. Now, the royal palace   lies in ruins; the king and queen, the royal guard, and the Directorate of Wizards   are dead; the land is lawless; and Prince Tristan\u2014 forced by the Coven to murder   his father, the King\u2014is a wanted man. In a cavernous underground labyrinth, once   headquarters of the wizards\u2019 council, Tristan has taken refuge with his sister, Shailiha,   her infant daughter, the wizard Wigg\u2014the lone surviving member of the Directorate\u2014and   the crippled wizard Faegan, returned from self-imposed exile in the forest of Shadowood.   Together they face the daunting task of restoring order to Eutracia and winning back   the allegiance of her subjects. But suddenly, even these challenges pale beside a   truly terrifying turn of events. The sacred jewel that is the source of all magic   has inexplicably begun to lose its power. Without its age-old enchantment to sustain   their spells, the immortal wizards will perish . . . and magic will vanish from Eutracia   forever. At the same time, a mysterious and ruthless mercenary has declared a bounty   upon the head of Prince Tristan. And an army of wizards on a mission to rid Eutracia   of monsters created by the Coven has fallen prey to an insidious breed of creatures\u2014beings   that can only have sprung from forbidden use of malevolent magic. With time and their   powers dwindling, Wigg and Faegan desperately seek to discover who, or what, has   succeeded the dead Sorceresses in laying siege to Eutracia. But when the shocking   truth is revealed, and an evil that transcends life itself is made known, it is Tristan,   more than any other, who will be stunned to his very soul. And it is Tristan who   will be thrust into the ultimate battle\u2014for his life, his land, and the course of   his destiny.",

        "Description": "JavaServer Pages (JSP) has built a huge following since the release of JSP 1.0 in 1999, providing Enterprise Java developers with a flexible tool for the development of dynamic web sites and web applications. While new point releases over the years, along with the introduction of the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL), have incrementally improved the rough areas of the first version of the JSP specification, JSP 2.0 takes this technology to new heights.JavaServer Pages, Third Edition, is completely revised and updated to cover the JSP 2.0 and JSTL 1.1 specifications. It includes detailed coverage of the Expression Language (EL) incorporated into JSP 2.0, the JSTL 1.1 tag libraries and the new function library, the new tag file format that enables custom tag library development without Java code, the simplified Java tag library API, improvements in the JSP XML syntax, and more. Further, it details setup of the Apache Tomcat server, JSP and JSTL syntax and features, error handling and debugging, authentication and personalization, database access, XML processing, and internationalization.This book recognizes the different needs of the two groups of professionals who want to learn JSP: page authors interested in using JSP elements in web pages, and programmers concerned with learning the JSP API and using JSP effectively as a part of an enterprise application. If you're in the first group, you'll learn from the practical web application examples in the second part of the book. If you're in the latter group, you'll appreciate the detailed coverage of advanced topics in the third part, such as how to integrate servlets and JavaBeans components with JSP using the popular Apache Struts MVC framework, and how to develop custom tag libraries using the JSP API, with realistic examples that you can use as a springboard for your own libraries.\"Hans Bergsten, a JSP expert group veteran and one of our most active contributors, has thoroughly and accurately captured the new features of JSP 2.0 and JSTL 1.1 in a way that is well-organized and easy to understand. With excellent, to-the-point examples, this book is a 'must have' for any serious JSP 2.0 developer.\"--Mark Roth, JSP 2.0 Specification Lead, Sun Microsystems, Inc.Hans Bergsten is the founder of Gefion Software, a company focused on Java services and products based on J2EE technologies. Hans has been an active participant in the working groups for both the servlet and JSP specifications since their inception and contributes to other related JCP specifications, such as JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) and JavaServer Faces (JSF), and, as one of the initial members of the Apache Jakarta Project Management Committee, helped develop the Apache Tomcat reference implementation for the servlet and JSP specifications.",

Using the latest aerial surveillance, state-of-the-art cameras, and high definition technology, the creators of Planet Earth have assembled more than 400 stunning photographs of wondrous natural landscapes from around the globe, including incredible footage of the rarely spotted, almost mythical creatures that live in these habitats. Many of the images reveal inaccessible places that few have seen and record animal behavior that has never been filmed or photographed before. With the help of this highly advanced technology and the world's premier wildlife photographers, the book takes us on a spectacular journey from the world's greatest rivers and impressive gorges, to its mightiest mountains, hidden caves and caverns, and vast deserts. Planet Earth captures breathtaking sequences of predators and their prey, lush vistas of forests viewed from the tops of towering trees, the oceans and their mysterious creatures viewed from beneath the surface, and much more&#151;in a magnificent adventure that brings unknown wonders of the natural world into our living rooms.Copub: BBC Worldwide Americas",

        "Description": "Craft is the cauldron in which the writing gets forged.Ralph Fletcher and JoAnn Portalupi argue that too often we concentrate on the beginning and ending of the writing process&#151;conceiving and correcting&#151;while leaving students on their own to make a thousand critical decisions in their writing about crafting leads, voice, structure, supporting detail, setting, mood, and character.What elements of craft can we teach student writers, and at what age are they ready to learn them? This book answers both questions. Craft Lessons is the practical text for the over-scheduled writing teacher who wants to give students fresh challenges for their writing but doesn't have time to pore over dozens of trade books to do so.There are three main sections in the book: one geared for teachers of primary students, one for teachers of grades 3-4, and one for teachers of middle school writers. This developmental structure allows teachers to go directly to those craft lessons most applicable and adaptable to their own students. Each of the 78 lessons is presented on a single page in an easy-to-read format. And every lesson features three teaching guidelines:Discussion&#151;A brief look at the reasons for teaching the particular element of craft.How to Teach It&#151;Concrete language showing exactly how a teacher might bring this craft element to students in individual writing conferences or a small-group setting.Resource Material&#151;A listing of the book or text referred to in the craft lesson plus additional texts you can use and references to a passage, a poem, or a piece of student writing in the Appendixes.Craft Lessons also explores the context&#151;the crucial classroom conditions&#151;for successfully bringing rich ideas to young writers. It will appeal to both experienced writing teachers seeking new horizons for their writers and teachers who are relatively new to teaching writing.Be sure to take a look at Nonfiction Craft Lessons: Teaching Information Writing K-8 and the When Students Write videotapes.",
