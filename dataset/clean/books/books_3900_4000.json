        "Title": "What We've Lost: How the Bush Administration Has Curtailed Our Freedoms, Mortgaged Our Economy, Ravaged Our Environment, and Damaged Our Standing in the World",
        "Authors": "By Carter, Graydon",
        "Description": "What We've Lost addresses the fragile state of U.S. democracy with a critical review of the Bush administration by one of our leading magazine editors, Graydon Carter. Carter has expressed his deep dissatisfaction with the current state of the nation in his monthly editor's letters in Vanity Fair--which have aroused widespread comment--and now provides a sweeping, painstakingly detailed account of the ruinous effects of this president.The invasion of Iraq, which has proven so costly for the U.S. in lives, dollars, and international standing, is only the tip of the iceberg. It is the war at home, a quiet, covert, and in many ways more lasting and damaging war, that Carter is most wary of. The Bush White House has chipped away at decades' worth of advances in personal rights, women's rights, the economy, and the environment. It is difficult to point to a single element of American society that comes under federal jurisdiction that is not worse off now than it was an administration ago, from civil liberties to the economy, foreign affairs to the environment.Carter discusses these topics and many more with great cogency and specificity, detailing what Bush's radical agenda means for America's future--and its future standing in the world. What We've Lost is not the position paper of a policy wonk or a pundit, but the impassioned argument of a concerned citizen in response to the most precarious political crisis of our time.",

        "Description": "The U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842 was one of the most ambitious undertakings of the nineteenth century and one of the largest voyages of discovery the Western world had ever seen - six magnificent sailing vessels and a crew of hundreds that included botanists, geologists, mapmakers, and biologists, all under the command of the young, brash Lieutenant Charles Wilkes. Their goal was to cover the Pacific Ocean, top to bottom, and to plant the American flag around the world. Four years after embarking, they returned to the United States having accomplished this and much more. They discovered a new southern continent, which Wilkes would name Antarctica. They were the first Americans to survey the treacherous Columbia River, the first to chart dozens of newly discovered islands all across the Pacific. They explored volcanoes in Hawaii, confirmed Charles Darwin's theory of the formation of coral atoll, and collected thousands of specimens that eventually became the foundation of the Smithsonian's scientific collections.",

        "Description": "\"I was born in rain and I will die in rain,\" begins Kate Braverman\u2019s The Incantation of Frida K., an imagined life journey of Frida Kahlo. The book opens and closes inside the mind of Frida K., at 46, on her deathbed, taking us through a kaleidoscope of memories and hallucinations where we shiver for two hundred pages on the threshold of life and death, dream and reality, truth and myth. Defiant and uncompromising, Frida bears the wounds of her body and spirit with a stark pride, transcending all limitations, wrapping her senses around the places, events, and conversations in her past. Frida K. interacts from her hospital bed with her mother, sister, Diego, and her nurse. She calls herself a \"water woman,\" navigating into unexplored dimensions of her world, leading us through the alleys of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, of Paris in 1939 (where she rubbed shoulders with Andr\u00e9 Breton), and of her neighborhood in Mexico City, Coyoacan. Her voyage is an inward one, an incantation before dying. In The Incantation of Frida K., Braverman\u2019s language dances and spins. She carves out a bold interpretation of the life of an artist to whom she is vitally connected.",

Johnson, orator, scholar, teacher, and statesman and an almost forgotten man in Delaware history. Inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, he established what was for a time considered to be the finest print shop in the State of Delaware. The fortress-like stone building that was home to the Newark Post still stands, and at the time of this writing the lively hometown paper is celebrating its ninetieth year. His editorials kept the citizens of Newark well informed. He offered his paper as a forum to all who wished to express their opinions in a responsible way.Extremely patriotic, he served two years as State Representative and four years as Secretary of State, encompassing World War I.Suffering from ill health most of his life, this frail man persevered in his efforts to raise the living and educational standards of all Delawarians. Considered the state's foremost orator, he often delivered speeches with such force that he received standing ovations and then had to be helped, exhausted, from the stage. His punishing work schedule sometimes left him bedridden over the weekend in order to build up enough strength to make it through the following week. Sadly, his life was cut short at the age of forty-eight, depriving the State of Delaware of one of its most progressive and dedicated visionaries.",

        "Description": "The stories in this sparkling debut collection all take place in the state of Maine -- which, in the hands of this madly talented young writer, quickly comes to stand for the state we're all in when we face the moments that change our lives forever. Two young hooligans have to decide whether to help the cop who has a heart attack while he's chasing them, or to cut and run. A young man at a party of coastal aristocrats has to deal with the surreal request to put a rich old coot out of his misery. Is a son going to abet his truck-driver father's art larceny or not? Should an amateur fighter take on the archetypal tough guy? Can the young father defend his family if the diver helping to free the tangled propeller of their boat turns out to be a real threat?With humor, edginess, an eye for human idiosyncrasy, and a nice relish for menace, Lewis Robinson shows us the lives of the wealthy and poor, the delinquent and romantic, and the socalled ordinary -- in transition, at turning points, and always with universal implications. These stories are at once classic and modern, complex and accessible, and, taken together, they bring the good news that a significant, compassionate new voice in American fiction has arrived.",

It follows Maria de las Nieves Moran through the nineteenth-century Central America of convents, ballrooms, and coffee plantations, to the stately Fifth Avenue addresses of New York. When we meet Maria de las Nieves, she is an obsessively bookish and dreamy novice nun - but this career is cut short when the country's new ruler orders the closing of the convents. What will be her fate in the rapidly changing secular world? When she takes a job at the British legation and enrolls in a writing class taught by Jose Marti, her life is transformed by the brilliant and seductive poet and hero of Cuban independence, whose year in that Central American capital results in more than one broken heart and in Latin America's most famous love poem.Maria de las Nieves's story unfolds among an unforgettable cast of characters striving for love or success in late-nineteenth-century Central America: Paquita, her lifelong best friend and nemesis, who begins a beautiful and impetuous schoolgirl and ends up hosting one of Gilded Age New York's celebrated salons; Mack Chinchilla, the Yankee-Indio entrepreneur intent on winning Maria de las Nieves's hand; a stuffy British diplomat looking after the Queen's interest in the isthmus, and his own in our heroine; Mr. Doveton, the smooth-talking former Confederate ambassador and double agent; Don Jose, the elderly Jewish umbrella repairman who becomes her trusted confidante; and a character known only as \"the Mysterious Muchacho.\" And when Maria de las Nieves departs on a packet boat to New York years later, young daughter in tow, she continues to evade Paquita's - and our - curiosity over who, of her many suitors, is the girl's father, and what really happened between her and Jose Marti.",

        "Title": "The United States and the End of the Cold War: Implications, Reconsiderations, Provocations",
        "Authors": "By Gaddis, John Lewis",
        "Description": "The Cold War ended with an exhilarating wave of events: the toppling of the Berlin Wall, the rise of the dissident poet Vaclav Havel, the revolution in Romania.  Americans rejoiced at the dramatic conclusion of the long struggle.  \"But victories in wars--hot or cold--tend to unfocus the mind,\" writes John Gaddis.  \"It can be a dangerous thing to have achieved one's objectives, because one then has to decide what to do next.\"  In The United States and the End of the Cold War, Gaddis provides a sharp focus on the long history of the Cold War, shedding new light on its sudden ending, as well as on what might come next.      In this provocative, insightful book, Gaddis offers a number of thoughtful essays on the history of international relations during the last half century.  His reassessments of important figures and themes from the Cold War are sometimes surprising.  For example, he portrays John Foster Dulles and Ronald Reagan as far more flexible and perceptive statesmen than the missile-toting caricatures depicted in editorial cartoons.  And he takes a second look at the importance of espionage and intelligence in Cold War history, a field often left to buffs and spy novelists.  Most important, he focuses on the central elements in superpower relations.  In an eloquent account of the American style of foreign policy in the twentieth century, for instance, he explores how Americans (having learned the lesson of Adolf Hitler) consistently equated the forms of foreign governments with their external behavior, assuming that authoritarian states would be aggressive states.  He also analyzes the \"tectonics\" of Cold War history, demonstrating how long term changes in international affairs and Soviet bloc countries built up pressures that led to the sudden earthquakes of 1989.  And along the way, Gaddis illuminates such topics as the role of morality in American foreign policy, the relevance of nuclear weapons to the balance of power, and the objectives of containment.  He even includes (and criticizes) an essay entitled, \"How the Cold War Might End,\" written before the dramatic events of recent years, to demonstrate how quickly the tide of history can overwhelm contemporary analysis.  Gaddis concludes with a thoughtful consideration of the problems and forces at work in the post-Cold War world.     Author of such works as The Long Peace and Strategies of Containment, John Lewis Gaddis is one of the leading authorities on postwar American foreign policy.  In these perceptive, highly readable essays, he provides a fresh assessment of the evolution of the Cold War, and insight into the shape of things to come.",

        "Description": "In this book, an eminent educational historian examines some important aspects of American schooling over the past centuries, illuminating the relation between education and other broad changes in American society and providing a historical perspective for contemporary efforts at school reform.Maris Vinovskis critically reviews and integrates recent work in educational history and provides new research on neglected topics. He discusses such issues as: the gradual shift from the family to the public schools in the responsibility for educating the young; the rise and fall of infant schools between 1840 and 1860; the crisis in the teaching of morality in the public schools of the mid-nineteenth century; early efforts to provide schooling for impoverished children; and the evolution of the belief that education improves individual economic and social mobility. He also studies school attendance and discovers that a much higher percentage of children may have attended public high schools in the nineteenth century than has been assumed, investigates when the practice of placing children in grades according to their age became widespread, and assesses whether different age groups in previous eras varied in their support for schooling\u2014as they seem to be doing now.",

        "Title": "Misunderestimated: The President Battles Terrorism, John Kerry, and the Bush Haters",
        "Authors": "By Sammon, Bill",
        "Description": "A riveting portrait of President Bush as he broadens the war on terror overseas -- and plunges into high-stakes political battles at home\"They misunderestimated me,\" George W. Bush famously remarked on the eve of his historic presidency. Fractured syntax aside, Bush was right: his detractors misunderstood his appeal to the American public, and underestimated his considerable political skills. In this compelling new book, Bill Sammon reveals how the president is turning these misperceptions to his advantage in the looming showdown with John Kerry and the Bush haters.As senior White House correspondent for the Washington Times, Sammon has been granted extraordinary access to the president and his closest confidants, from political gurus Karl Rove and Andy Card to foreign policy advisers Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. The result is a compelling chronicle of the second eighteen months of George W. Bush's term, as the administration's focus shifts from al Qaeda and Afghanistan to Iraq and the 2004 election. Sammon's on-the-scene reporting and exclusive interviews with the president and his top advisers reveal how the White House is implementing the most profound shift in U.S. foreign policy in more than half a century, prompting an eminent Democratic historian to rank Bush alongside John Quincy Adams and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as one of America's \"grand\" strategists. For the first time, Sammon discloses the president's vow that Kerry will \"regret\" bad-mouthing the liberation of Iraq, the seminal event in the post-9/11 phase of the Bush presidency. Rove even details for Sammon the White House strategy to paint Kerry as a condescending elitist whose \"blatant\" attempts to capitalize on his Vietnam experience will ultimately come back to haunt him.Misunderestimated also meticulously tracks the rise of the Bush haters, a disturbing political phenomenon that colors everything from the war on terrorism to the presidential campaign. The impact extends to the press, which Sammon exposes for racing to brand Operation Iraqi Freedom another Vietnam \"quagmire\" less than eighteen months after making the same blunder during the Afghan war.In Misunderestimated, Sammon takes readers inside the Oval Office for historic decisions of war and peace, aboard Air Force One for a daring, surprise descent into Baghdad, and even on an intimate tour of Bush's beloved Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford, Texas. It's a mesmerizing account of a president determined not to repeat his father's two fundamental mistakes -- abandoning Iraq and failing to vanquish the Democrats.",

Dr. Spock may tell moms to trust their instincts, but Lynch's Misfit Mommies want to do every last thing but that. They feel like frauds and imposters, and Lynch's real-girl's voice will be instantly recognizable to them. Lynch will walk and talk new moms through it all: from lamenting the hot dogs and second-hand smoke they were raised on (and, of course, \"you turned out just fine\") to the realization that kids are kind of germy and gross (but feeling that way doesn't make one a bad mother) to keeping it together at work with Cheerios in the old nursing bra.",

Professors' salaries and the student quality are high. Creature comforts abound. Then tragedy strikes.Eric MacInnes was the school's golden boy - until a misfortune in a campus hot tub leaves him a beautiful corpse. Dealing with this apparently freak accident, Harvard's administrators desperately need somebody to placate both the victim's parents and the Boston police. As Eric's former teacher, a struggling assistant professor at the bottom end of the exalted \"B-School\"'s tenure track, Wim Vermeer is the natural choice for the assignment.But Wim is shocked when the drowning begins to look like an ingenious murder. For Eric floated through a rarefied world where everybody has money and power and absolutely nothing to kill for...or so it appears. Now determined to uncover the truth, Wim begins a quest that will take him from the swank hotels of old Boston to the mountain hamlets of upstate New York to the lush beaches of Puerto Rico. Applying his professorial research skills to the gritty real world of high chicanery and low crime, he unearths dark secrets that have been zealously hidden by forces unknown.When further bloodshed suddenly places Wim himself at the top of the suspect list, he seeks out a strategic ally and conceives a daring game plan. The ally is Boston Police Captain Barbara Brouillard, a cop's cop with tangled brown curls and a penchant for making up her own rules. The game plan is to wade straight into the camp of the people who most want him dead - and cut a deal that might just save his life.",

        "Title": "The Secret Language of Eating Disorders: How You Can Understand and Work to Cure Anorexia and Bulimia",
        "Authors": "By Claude-Pierre, Peggy",
        "Description": "\"I feel so dirty, hopeless, no-good, fat, scared, a failure. I don't deserve to live.\"\"My daughter is 5'8\" and 60 pounds. She won't comply with anyone. She has ruined the family.\"\"I can't be cured. I'm too bad. I'm going to have to deal with this the rest of my life.\"\"My doctor told me that I don't want to grow up.\"\"I hate myself for being the cause of all of this.\"\"I don't want my daughter to die. They say we are a dysfunctional family, but we don't fight and we love our daughter. Surely something can be done.\"All of these statements are based on myths and misconceptions about anorexia and bulimia. Unfortunately, these myths and others not only deepen the suffering of victims of eating disorders, but shape how we regard and treat those victims. If you are a parent , family member, loved one, or caregiver of a victim, or a victim yourself, you know the punishing pain and sense of hopelessness caused by eating disorders. Now an extraordinary new book offers new hope and help to all whose lives are threatened by these scourges. In The Secret Language of Eating Disorders, Peggy Claude-Pierre, founder of the world-renowned eating disorders program at the Montreaux Clinic in Victoria, Canada, puts these damaging myths to rest and reveals her groundbreaking theories on the ultimate cure for illnesses that current medicine treats with little success.Peggy Claude-Pierre developed her unique insights into eating disorders through successfully treating her own two anorexic daughters and hundreds of acutely ill patients at Montreaux, which specializes in treating victims near death whom doctors and hospitals haven't helped. She became convinced that eating disorders stem from a complex negative mindset. Often established at birth, it causes sufferers to feel an overwhelming sense of worthlessness that frequently results in a slow process of self-destruction. It is Peggy Claude-Pierre's conviction that this mindset--and the resulting eating disorder--can be permanently reversed through a program based on unconditional love, regard, positive reinforcement, easing of the victim's burdens of blame and responsibility, and objectivity training.In The Secret Language of Eating Disorders, Claude-Pierre details her theories on the true causes of anorexia and bulimia and lays out the basis of the Montreaux program, which has an astonishingly high success rate, curing even the gravest cases. She describes the origins of the negative mindset and the five stages of recovery from eating disorders, spotlights the special challenges of coping with them at home, and offers clear, practical guidelines to working effectively with health professionals. She also shares the voices of dozens of former patients who offer their own stories of recovery as inspiration to victims, their families, and loved ones. Peggy Claude-Pierre's heartfelt message of hope is that eating disorders can be cured, not merely managed, and that deep within every person suffering from these illnesses is a loving, deserving soul who can and should be saved. As Peggy Claude-Pierre writes to victims, \"You are not failures at life, merely at understanding your own value. Soon professionals across the globe will discontinue treating the symptoms of eating disorders as the cause.\" This powerful, compassionate book will revolutionize the way we think about eating disorders and their victims. It will literally save lives.",

At his compound on a remote island off the coast of Washington state, Los has reinterpreted the nature of good and evil, of God and man. He has proclaimed himself the center of a new universe, and has bestowed the right to life only on those selected for his insular community; all others are expendable. But some of those others are closing in on the island and on the hallucinogenic working of Los's minds: a ground zero of psychosis and mayhem with the potential to leave each of them dramatically and permanently harmed.",

In this book, a leading expert in public management examines the most important reform statutes passed and concludes that the problem is not too little reform but too much.Paul Light explains that Congress and the presidency have never decided whether they trust government and its employees to do their jobs well, and so they have moved back and forth over the decades between four reform philosophies: scientific management, war on waste, watchful eye, and liberation management. These four philosophies, argues Light, operate with different goals, implementation strategies, and impacts. Yet reform initiatives draw on one or another of them almost at random, often canceling out the potential benefits of a particular statute by passing a contradictory statute soon afterward. Light shows that as the public has become increasingly distrustful of government, the reform agenda has favored the war on waste and watchful eye. He analyzes the consequences of these changes for the overall performance of government and offers policy recommendations for future reform approaches.",

Grace the icon and Grace the woman were two very different creatures, and now celebrated biographer Robert Lacey has managed to unearth the secrets beneath her serene surface. In Grace, he presents the first balanced portrait of a complex, deeply conflicted actress, wife, and mother who dared to make her dreams come true.Lacey, who has written definitive books on Queen Elizabeth II, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Ford family, gained unprecedented access to Grace's friends and colleagues. He weaves an extraordinary story that begins in Philadelphia, where Grace's father, an Olympic athlete and local hero, often shunned his shy and sickly daughter. Grace was determined to win the attention of her father and the world. While carefully cultivating the image of the white-gloved young lady, she became a surprisingly brazen, even reckless, young woman. She fell into bed with her best friend's husband, her drama teacher, and some of the most glamorous film stars of her era, including Clark Gable and William Holden.By the time Grace met her prince, she had flirted repeatedly with the altar, only to have her parents veto her choices. Rainier, however, won over Grace and her family in a whirlwind courtship, cemented by a secret correspondence. Lacey writes of Grace's joy at her wedding and her gradual disenchantment with her cloistered palace life. He reveals that after ten years of marriage to Rainier, Grace was deeply wounded by his arrogance, petulance, and autocratic treatment of her. As she approached middle age, the princess found herself living a separate life from Rainier in Paris, battling with her headstrong and willful daughters, and seeking the affection she craved from a succession of handsome young men.To her public, however, Grace always maintained the image of Her Serene Highness, the adored princess who had achieved perfect happiness. She worked hard at her official and charitable duties and was devoted to her people. Grace was deeply mourned when her car careened off a narrow road in September 1982. Lacey provides revealing new details about the accident and the circumstances surrounding Grace's medical care and death. Grace is a haunting tale of a beloved tragic heroine.",

But at home, in the evenings, Faith found herself watching Jay go slack-jawed after dinner and too many gin and tonics, unable to hold up his end of a conversation, much less fulfill any of his other conjugal duties.So Faith leaves her husband: \"You drunk, me gone!\" She drives her books, papers, and everyday wedding china to the dorms, where she takes up residence with her \"student-athletes,\" or, as she affectionately calls them, her \"thugs.\" But even Faith's hilariously inventive attempts to interest her boys in something other than their batting averages aren't enough to distract her from the pain of her failed marriage. She's drawn to the radio, to the late-night sound of her husband's sweet voice. When she hears that Jay has embarked on a \"High on Wife Marathon\" for sobriety, she rushes to his side, determined to believe, one more time, that he is sober. But Jay soon discovers something about his wife that sends him on one last deadly binge, one with consequences reaching far beyond their damaged marriage.",

So when beautiful, ambitious and abrasive Maggie Winslow approaches her with an idea for an investigative series - a new look at three unrelated and hitherto unsolved local crimes - Henrie O urges the tenacious budding reporter to pursue the story with uncommon vigor.But Maggie's zeal may have cost her her life. The next day her corpse is discovered - at the very site of one of the trio of crimes the extraordinary young woman was investigating at the time of her death. The police call Maggie's murder a crime of passion and arrest an appropriate suspect. But Henrie O doubts that justice has been properly served.Perhaps Maggie was asking too many questions about a decade-old double homicide...or about the disappearance years ago of a popular dean...or about the unsolved shooting of a local businessman.
