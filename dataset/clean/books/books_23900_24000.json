        "Authors": "By Malouf, David",
        "Description": "In Remembering Babylon David Malouf gives us a rich and compelling novel, in language of astonishing poise and resonance, about the settling of the continent down under, Australia, and the vicissitudes of first contact with the unknown.In the mid-1840s a thirteen-year-old cabin boy, Gemmy Fairley, is cast ashore from a British shipwreck onto the Queensland coast, and is taken in by aborigines. Sixteen years later, three children from a white settlement come upon this apparition: \"The stick-like legs, all knobbed at the joints, suggested a wounded waterbird, a brolga, or a human that in the manner of the tales they told one another, all spells and curses, had been changed into a bird, but only halfway, and now, neither one thing nor the other, was hopping and flapping towards them out of a world over there, beyond the no-mans-land of the swamps...of nightmare rumours, superstitions and all that belonged to Absolute Dark.\"Possessed of lyrical intensity and always respectful of human complexity, Remembering Babylon tells the story of Gemmy, and of his relation to the whites. Given shelter by the McIvors, the family of the three children, he seems at first to have a secure role in the settlement, but currents of fear and distrust intensify. At once white and black, a man with a voice but unable to speak the language, he confounds all categories that might explain him. To everyone he meets - from George Abbot, the romantically aspiring young teacher; to Janet McIvor, on the verge of adulthood; to the eccentric governor of Queensland himself - Gemmy is a force of nature that both fascinates and repels. He finds his own whiteness as unsettling in his new world as the knowledge he brings with him of the savage, the aboriginal.In his most accomplished novel to date, David Malouf has written a powerful fiction, informed by a vision of eternal human differences. Remembering Babylon is a brilliant mythopoeia of our unending encounter with the Other.",

Nicolaus Mills presents a compelling argument that a culture of meanness is sweeping across America. This mean-spiritedness is not confined to the arena of politics, where mudslinging and assaults on the poor and vulnerable are commonplace. Meanness penetrates every aspect of our everyday lives, from relations between men and women to the programs we watch on TV. Witness the huge popularity of serial-killer trading cards, the spectacles of public humiliation on TV talk shows, the guiltless aplomb with which CEOs announce the downsizing of thousands of loyal employees, the bumper stickers that ask, \"Where is Lee Harvey Oswald when his country needs him?\" We have crossed a line, Mills maintains, that \"not long ago seemed to mark the outer bounds of decency.\" Mills a",

For most animals, however, freedom means working a steady job (usually for human bosses) and enjoying the comforts and complacencies of human life.Into this mix flies Charlie the Crow, rabble-rouser and avian revolutionary, whose mission it is to wean animals from the bottle of contemporary culture. But the animals find that freedom depends on who's defining it, and Charlie becomes a media celebrity - appearing on talk shows to promote books, movies, and other endorsement opportunities. As the revolution is co-opted by savvy profiteers, like the marketing maven Bunny Fairchild, Charlie goes underground, traveling with his reluctant pal Buster the Penguin (who longs for his domestic life back in Antarctica), pursued by an assortment of animal activists, CIA and military operatives, reporters, movie moguls, publishers, and others. Everyone wants a piece of Charlie's radical action...even if they have to kill him to get it.",

Whether you have read her work or not, you have a special treat in store in Saffy's Angel.  You'll meet the four Casson children, whose mother, Eve, a fine-arts painter, has given them the names of paint colors. Cadmium, called Caddy, is the eldest; then comes Saffron, known as Saffy; Indigo, the only boy; and Rose, the youngest. When Saffy discovers quite by accident that she has been adopted, she is deeply upset, though the others assure her it makes no difference at all. Saffy is the daughter of Eve's twin sister, who lived in Siena, Italy, and died in a car crash. Grandad brought Saffy, as a very small child, back from Siena.  At Grandad's death, he leaves something to each of the children. To Saffy, it is \"her angel,\" although no one knows its identity. How Saffy discovers what her angel is, with the help of an energetic new friend, lies at the heart of this enchanting story. Unforgettable characters come alive in often deeply humorous and always absorbing events to make a book to be treasured for a long, long time.",

        "Title": "President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination",
        "Authors": "By Reeves, Richard",
        "Description": "Twenty-five years after Ronald Reagan became president, Richard Reeves has written a surprising and revealing portrait of one of the most important leaders of the twentieth century. As he did in his bestselling books President Kennedy: Profile of Power and President Nixon: Alone in the White House, Reeves has used newly declassified documents and hundreds of interviews to show a president at work day by day, sometimes minute by minute.President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination is the story of an accomplished politician, a bold, even reckless leader, a gambler, a man who imagined an American past and an American future -- and made them real. He is a man of ideas who changed the world for better or worse, a man who understands that words are often more important than deeds. Reeves shows a man who understands how to be President, who knows that the job is not to manage the government but to lead the nation. In many ways, a quarter of a century later, he is still leading. As his vice president, George H. W. Bush, said after Reagan was shot and hospitalized in 1981: \"We will act as if he were here.\"He is a heroic figure if not always a hero. He did not destroy communism, as his champions claim, but he knew it would self-destruct and hastened the collapse. No small thing. He believed the Soviet Union was evil and he had contempt for the established American policies of containment and d\u00e9tente. Asked about his own Cold War strategy, he answered: \"We win. They lose!\" Like one of his heroes, Franklin D. Roosevelt, he has become larger than life. As Roosevelt became an icon central to American liberalism, Reagan became the nucleus holding together American conservatism. He is the only president whose name became a political creed, a noun not an adjective: \"Reaganism.\" Reagan's ideas were so old they seemed new. He preached an individualism, inspiring and cruel, that isolated and shamed the halt and the lame. He dumbed-down America, brilliantly blending fact and fiction, transforming political debate into emotion-driven entertainment. He recklessly mortgaged America with uncontrolled military spending, less taxation, and more debt.In focusing on the key moments of the Reagan presidency, Reeves recounts the amazing resiliency of Ronald Reagan, the real \"comeback kid.\" Here is a seventy-year-old man coming back from a near-fatal gunshot wound, from cancer, from the worst recession in American history. Then, in personal despair as his administration was shredded by the lying and secrets of hidden wars and double-dealing, he was able to forge one of history's amazing relationships with the leader of \"the Evil Empire.\" That story is told for the first time using the transcripts of the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings, the climax of an epic story -- as if he were here.",

Dallas Younger,  a star athlete in high school, now drifts from tavern to poker game, losing money,  and, inevitably, another set of false teeth. His ex-wife, Anne, is stuck in a losing  battle with her mother over the care of her sick father. And their son, Randall,  is deliberately neglecting his school work--because in a place like Mohawk it doesn't  pay to be too smart.\u00a0In Mohawk, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Richard Russo, explores these lives with profound  compassion and flint-hard wit. Out of derailed ambitions and old loves, secret hatreds  and communal myths, he has created a richly plotted, densely populated, and wonderfully  written novel that captures every nuance of America's backyard.",

Focusing on the \"disorderly conduct\" women and some men used to break away from the Victorian Era's rigid class and sex roles, it examines the dramatic changes in male-female relations, family structure, sex, social custom, and ritual that occurred as colonial America was transformed by rapid industrialization.  Included are two now classic essays on gender relations in 19th-century America, \"The Female World of Love and Ritual: Relations Between Women in Nineteenth-Century America\" and \"The New Woman as Androgyne: Social Order and Gender Crisis, 1870-1936,\" as well as Smith-Rosenberg's more recent work, on abortion, homosexuality, religious fanatics, and revisionist history.   Throughout Disorderly Conduct, Smith-Rosenberg startles and convinces, making us re-evaluate a society we thought we understood, a society whose outward behavior and inner emotional life now take on a new meaning.",

In the looming shadow of world enmities resumed, and of Asia's coming centrality in world affairs, a man and a woman seek to recover self-reliance, balance, and tenderness, struggling to reclaim their humanity.
