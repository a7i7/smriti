        "Authors": "By Hawking, Stephen W.",
        "Description": "Stephen Hawking\u2019s phenomenal, multimillion-copy bestseller, A Brief History of Time, introduced the ideas of this brilliant theoretical physicist to readers all over the world. Now, in a major publishing event, Hawking returns with a lavishly illustrated sequel that unravels the mysteries of the major breakthroughs that have occurred in the years since the release of his acclaimed first book.The Universe in a Nutshell\u2022 Quantum mechanics\u2022 M-theory\u2022 General relativity\u2022 11-dimensional supergravity\u2022 10-dimensional membranes\u2022 Superstrings\u2022 P-branes\u2022 Black holesOne of the most influential thinkers of our time, Stephen Hawking is an intellectual icon, known not only for the adventurousness of his ideas but for the clarity and wit with which he expresses them. In this new book Hawking takes us to the cutting edge of theoretical physics, where truth is often stranger than fiction, to explain in laymen\u2019s terms the principles that control our universe.Like many in the community of theoretical physicists, Professor Hawking is seeking to uncover the grail of science \u2014 the elusive Theory of Everything that lies at the heart of the cosmos. In his accessible and often playful style, he guides us on his search to uncover the secrets of the universe \u2014 from supergravity to supersymmetry, from quantum theory to M-theory, from holography to duality. He takes us to the wild frontiers of science, where superstring theory and p-branes may hold the final clue to the puzzle. And he lets us behind the scenes of one of his most exciting intellectual adventures as he seeks \u201cto combine Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman\u2019s idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.\u201dWith characteristic exuberance, Professor Hawking invites us to be fellow travelers on this extraordinary voyage through space-time. Copious four-color illustrations help clarify this journey into a surreal wonderland where particles, sheets, and strings move in eleven dimensions; where black holes evaporate and disappear, taking their secret with them; and where the original cosmic seed from which our own universe sprang was a tiny nut.The Universe in a Nutshell is essential reading for all of us who want to understand the universe in which we live. Like its companion volume, A Brief History of Time, it conveys the excitement felt within the scientific community as the secrets of the cosmos reveal themselves.",

Butterfly was an immediate sensation when it premiered in 1988.\u00a0It opens in the cramped prison cell where diplomat Rene Gallimard is being held captive by the French government\u2014and by his own illusions. He recalls a time when Song Liling, the beautiful Chinese diva, touched him with a love as vivid, as seductive\u2014and as elusive\u2014as a butterfly.How could he have known that his true love was, in fact, a spy for the Chinese government\u2014and a man disguised as a woman? The diplomat relives the twenty-year affair from the temptation to the seduction, from its consummation to the scandal that ultimately consumed them both.M. Butterfly is one of the most compelling, explosive, and slyly humorous dramas ever to light the Broadway stage, a work of unrivaled brilliance, illuminating the conflict between men and women, the differences between East and West, racial stereotypes\u2014and the shadows we cast around our most cherished illusions.The original cast included John Lithgow as Gallimard and BD Wong as Song Liling. During the show's 777-performance run, David Dukes, Anthony Hopkins, Tony Randall, and John Rubinstein were also cast as Gallimard. Hwang adapted the play for a 1993 film directed by David Cronenberg, starring Jeremy Irons and John Lone.TEXT OF THE ORIGINAL BROADWAY PRODUCTION",

        "Description": "This is a book for people who want to know what the future is going to look like and for people who want to know how to create the future. Gershenfeld offers a glimpse at the brave new post-computerized world, where microchips work for us instead of against us. He argues that we waste the potential of the microchip when we confine it to a box on our desk: the real electronic revolution will come when computers have all but disappeared into the walls around us. Imagine a digital book that looks like a traditional book printed on paper and is pleasant to read in bed but has all the mutability of a screen display. How about a personal fabricator that can organize digitized atoms into anything you want, or a musical keyboard that can be woven into a denim jacket? Gershenfeld tells the story of his Things that Think group at MIT's Media Lab, the group of innovative scientists and researchers dedicated to integrating digital technology into the fabric of our lives.",

        "Authors": "By Johnson, Steven",
        "Description": "From the author of the New York Times bestseller Mind Wide Open comes a groundbreaking assessment of popular culture as it's never been considered before: through the lens of intelligence.  The $10 billion video gaming industry is now the second-largest segment of the entertainment industry in the United States, outstripping film and far surpassing books. Reality television shows featuring silicone-stuffed CEO wannabes and bug-eating adrenaline junkies dominate the ratings. But prominent social and cultural critic Steven Johnson argues that our popular culture has never been smarter.  Drawing from fields as diverse as neuroscience, economics, and literary theory, Johnson argues that the junk culture we're so eager to dismiss is in fact making us more intelligent. A video game will never be a book, Johnson acknowledges, nor should it aspire to be-and, in fact, video games, from Tetris to The Sims to Grand Theft Auto, have been shown to raise IQ scores and develop cognitive abilities that can't be learned from books. Likewise, successful television, when examined closely and taken seriously, reveals surprising narrative sophistication and intellectual demands.  Startling, provocative, and endlessly engaging, Everything Bad Is Good for You is a hopeful and spirited account of contemporary culture. Elegantly and convincingly, Johnson demonstrates that our culture is not declining but changing-in exciting and stimulating ways we'd do well to understand. You will never regard the glow of the video game or television screen the same way again.",

        "Description": "Joe Simpson and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, had just reached the top of a 21,000-foot peak in the Andes when disaster struck. Simpson plunged off the vertical face of an ice ledge, breaking his leg. In the hours that followed, darkness fell and a blizzard raged as Yates tried to lower his friend to safety. Finally, Yates was forced to cut the rope, moments before he would have been pulled to his own death.The next three days were an impossibly grueling ordeal for both men. Yates, certain that Simpson was dead, returned to base camp consumed with grief and guilt over abandoning him. Miraculously, Simpson had survived the fall, but crippled, starving, and severely frostbitten was trapped in a deep crevasse. Summoning vast reserves of physical and spiritual strength, Simpson crawled over the cliffs and canyons of the Andes, reaching base camp hours before Yates had planned to leave.How both men overcame the torments of those harrowing days is an epic tale of fear, suffering, and survival, and a poignant testament to unshakable courage and friendship.",

He emerges five months later a transformed man.Simon's powerful, triumphant story combines the suspense of Into Thin Air with a crystalline, lyrical prose to explore the hypnotic draw of one of earth's deepest and most dangerous wildernesses.",

He continued that teaching nationally in his best-selling books, Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire and Fresh Faith, which told about the transforming power of God\u2019s love to convert prostitutes, addicts, the homeless, black people, white people, professional people, and working people.  Now Cymbala continues to spread the word about the power of God\u2019s Holy Spirit in the lives of people who seek Him.  Fresh faith is available to His church as God\u2019s people desire the Holy Spirit\u2019s constant infilling.  Cymbala\u2019s newest book talks about what it really means to be Spirit filled, both as individuals and as the church.  The Book of Acts is the basis for his study as Cymbala delves into what it was like for Christians back in the first century\u2014and what it can be like for them today.  The first century church believed in God\u2019s Word, in the constant infilling of His Spirit, and in the clear and direct responses of obedience to the scripture which defined the norm for their daily and spiritual lives.  Cymbala shows that same life in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit is available to us today for pastors, leaders, and lay people who are longing for revival.",

        "Title": "Muzzled: From T-Ball to Terrorism--True Stories That Should Be Fiction",
        "Authors": "By Smerconish, Michael A.",
        "Description": "Sick of the total BS of rampant PC?This brazen, furiously funny book is the antidote to today's poison of political correctness. With humor and chutzpah, attorney, commentator, and popular radio host Michael Smerconish takes on today's oversensitive culture with a collection of entertaining, outlandish anecdotes about PC gone wild-stories that are hilarious, horrifying, and unbelievably true.Why are sports leagues handing out trophies to losers? Why are little old grandmas hired to guard 200-pound prisoners? Why are newborn babies and old men with walkers singled out at the airport while likely terrorists are ushered through security with ease? This book shows through these absurdities that today's atmosphere of censorship and multiculturalism is paving the way for serious threats to our cultural identity and national security: \"It's one thing for the forces of political correctness to muzzle our day-to-day lives here at home in the US, quite another when that same cancer metastasizes into the war on terror.\"We must eradicate the PC disease. Our sanity-and our very lives-depend on it.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Michael Smerconish talks the talk: If you say unpopular things, watch out! Using vivid examples of PC rubbish, Muzzled will lead you into a world that would terrify Rod Serling. An entertaining and provocative book.\"-Bill O'Reilly\"Reads like fiction, too bad it's true.\"-Nelson DeMille, novelist, author of Night Fall and The General's Daughter\"The PC virus is out of control . . . and it's worse than you\u00a0think! In this entertaining and\u00a0important book, Michael Smerconish chronicles just how mindless things have\u00a0gotten in politically correct America. He tells fascinating stories that will make you laugh . . . right up until\u00a0the time they make you scream. Thanks to the PC crowd, we are all living in The United States of the Absurd.\"-Bernard\u00a0Goldberg, journalist and author\u00a0of 100 People Who Are Screwing Up\u00a0America, Arrogance, and Bias\"I really squirm whenever I find myself agreeing with Smerconish. (I know the feeling is mutual.) I did a lot of squirming while reading this provocative book. All true liberals and conservatives must agree with Smerconish that the PC muzzles must be removed so that people can decide based on the marketplace of ideas.\"-Alan Dershowitz, Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Harvard and author of Preemption\"I don't often find myself on the same side of the political barricades as Michael Smerconish. But Muzzled is a witty, provocative, and timely book. Even when Michael is wrong, which is often, he draws you in and keeps you\u00a0reading.\"-Arianna Huffington, author of Pigs at the Trough and Fanatics and Fools\"By proving the link between America's political correctness at home and its looming defeat abroad, Smerconish performs a great and courageous public service. Citizens should take this book to heart . . . and then vote to defeat the rogue multiculturalists who value 'ethnic and racial sensitivities' far more than America's survival.\"-Michael F. Scheuer, author of Imperial Hubris and Through Our Enemies' Eyes, former chief of the CIA's Osama bin Laden Unit\"In Muzzled, my American Blood Brother of status-quo-obliterating defiance, Michael Smerconish, once again smokes out the cockroaches of political correctness . . . Muzzled is a great title for a book that I am convinced every American school kid should read and be tested on. If a new generation doesn't grow some intellectual balls, our Once Great Nation will continue to repeat horrific mistakes and pay the price . . . Read it. Live it.\"-Ted Nugent, rock star, author, television personality, and hunter extraordinaire",

        "Title": "Nostradamus: The Millennium & Beyond: The Prophecies to 2016",
        "Authors": "By Greene, Liz and Lorie, Peter",
        "Description": "Nostradamus is still seen in the late 20th century as perhaps the most successful of all history's prophets. His bizarre writings have been interpreted during the last four centuries in many different ways. The verses or \"quatrains,\" written in old French, contain a number of key words which have never been quite understood until now. Words such as \"Mabus\" and \"Hieron\" have baffled commentators, who have presumed that they refer to events in our future.Peter Lorie, in this new volume of predictions for the next two decades, has successfully provided a completely new insight into the prophet's methods, basing them on events contemporary to Nostradamus' lifetime. The solutions that emerge cast a completely fresh light on the predictions and give us a powerful and positive view of our near and more distant future.In addition, with the help of Dr. Liz Greene, a worldrenowned astrologer and Jungian psychoanalyst, the book contains a complete astrological analysis of the years from 1996 to 2016, using national birth charts for the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and other major countries around the world. Although working as a clairvoyant and \"seer\" of his future, Nostradamus also used the celestial science of astrology to confirm his work, and would have access to similar astrological information that is now weaved into this original and penetrating study of the future.The result is a convincing partnership between magic and science which reveals, year by year, the political and social development of America, Europe, The Baltic States, Japan, and other parts of the world scene, and examines the grand schemes of war, government, power, natural disaster, and other important events.",

She was there to photograph the relics and artifacts collected by a highly secretive organization, founded two centuries earlier by an eccentric alchemist. And the alchemist's descendant - her employer, Mr. Gabriel Jones - had the eyes of a sorcerer ...After a night to remember, Venetia is prepared to cherish the memories of her romantic encounter and move on, but she is shattered when, shortly after their night together, she reads of Jones's death in the paper. As a private tribute to her one-time lover, she adopts the name \"Mrs. Jones\" and the guise of a respectable widow, and embarks on a new career as a fashionable photographer in London, where her unique ability to \"see\" beyond her subjects and capture that quality in her photography makes her photographs highly prized.But her romantic whim causes unexpected trouble. For one thing, Mr. Jones is about to stride, living and breathing, back into her life. And the bonds that tie them together include more than just the memory of passion; Venetia's special \"double vision\" has caught the attention of someone Mr. Jones is tracking - someone who will go to any lengths, even murder, to possess an ancient, extraordinary secret that has been lost for centuries. Someone who believes that as the \"wife\" of Mr. Jones, Venetia is the key.Now, as she introduces Gabriel about town as her miraculously back-from-the-dead \"husband,\" Venetia must join him in a perilous quest to track down a dangerous opponent who manages to stay one step ahead. As they explore the darker, wilder underbelly of the modern, scientific Victorian world, they must see through society's illusions - or this time, Gabriel Jones may not be rising from the dead, and neither may Mrs. Jones.",

        "Description": "As far back as she can remember, Azadeh Moaveni has felt at odds with her tangled identity as an Iranian-American. In suburban America, Azadeh lived in two worlds. At home, she was the daughter of the Iranian exile community,  serving tea, clinging to tradition, and dreaming of Tehran. Outside, she was a California girl who practiced yoga and listened to Madonna. For years, she ignored the tense standoff between her two cultures. But college magnified the clash between Iran and America, and after graduating,  she moved to Iran as a journalist. This is the story of her search for identity, between two cultures cleaved apart by a violent history. It is also the story of Iran, a restive land lost in the twilight of its revolution.    Moaveni's homecoming falls in the heady days of the country's reform movement, when young people demonstrated in the streets and shouted for the Islamic regime to end. In these tumultuous times, she struggles to build a life in a dark country, wholly unlike the luminous, saffron and   turquoise-tinted Iran of her imagination. As she leads us through the drug-soaked, underground parties of Tehran, into the hedonistic lives of young people desperate for change, Moaveni paints a rare portrait of Iran's rebellious next generation. The landscape of her Tehran \u2014 ski slopes, fashion shows, malls and cafes \u2014 is populated by a cast of young people whose exuberance and despair brings the modern reality of Iran to vivid life.",

        "Title": "Lockout: Why America Keeps Getting Immigration Wrong When Our Prosperity Depends on Getting It Right",
        "Authors": "By Wucker, Michele",
        "Description": "We are essentially a nation of people who once belonged  elsewhere, yet have long been deeply ambivalent about this  part of our history. After World War I, the fear of the  stranger overwhelmed America's confidence in our ability  to create one nation out of many peoples. We slammed the  door shut, only to realize our error and re-open it four  decades later.  Today, a record-high foreign-born population,  global instability, and economic uncertainty have once  again pushed America to a tipping point in our attitudes  not only toward immigration but toward our role in the  world?and the stakes have risen dramatically. Our economy  depends more than ever on immigrants, not only for  stereotypical low-skilled jobs, but much more so for  maintaining our technological edge and promoting  American products and services abroad. So far, America  has reaped the lion's share of the gains of globalization. Yet  for the first time ever, the world's best and brightest no  longer see this country as the only destination of choice.  In Lock Out, Michele Wucker documents the mistakes  that led to our predicament today, and clarifies why it  would be a catastrophic error of judgment, as well as a  demonstration of a colossal lack of self-knowledge, if  America attempted to turn its back on rest of the world and  in so doing on the best of itself.",

        "Authors": "By Halberstam, David",
        "Description": "One of America's most distinguished reporters and historians offers the deeply moving personal story of Engine 40, Ladder 35 -- located on the West Side of Manhattan near Lincoln Center -- and the absolute sacrifice its firefighters made on September 11, 2001. On the morning of September 11, 2001, two rigs carrying thirteen men set out from this firehouse: twelve of them would never return.Firehouse takes us to the epicenter of the tragedy. Through the kind of intimate portraits that are Halberstam's trademark, we watch the day unfold--the men called to duty while their families wait anxiously for news of them. In addition, we come to understand the culture of the firehouse itself: why gifted men do this; why, in so many instances, they are eager to follow in their fathers' footsteps and serve in so dangerous a profession; and why, more than anything else, it is not just a job, but a calling.This is journalism-as-history at its best, the story of what happens when one small institution gets caught in an apocalyptic day. Firehouse is a book that will move readers as few others have in our time. More than 6 years after his death David Halberstam remains one of this country's most respected journalists and revered authorities on American life and history in the years since WWII. A Pulitzer Prize-winner for his groundbreaking reporting on the Vietnam War, Halberstam wrote more than 20 books, almost all of them bestsellers. His work has stood the test of time and has become the standard by which all journalists measure themselves.",

        "Description": "Between your full-length mirror and high-school biology class, you probably think you know a lot about the human body. While it's true that we live in an age when we're as obsessed with our bodies as we are with celebrity hairstyles, the reality is that most of us know very little about what chugs, churns, and thumps throughout this miraculous, scientific, and artistic system of anatomy. Yes, you've owned your skin-covered shell for decades, but you probably know more about your cell-phone plan than you do about your own body. When it comes to your longevity and quality of life, understanding your internal systems gives you the power, authority, and ability to live a healthier, younger, and better life.        You: The Owner's Manual challenges your preconceived notions about how the human body works and ages, then takes you on a tour through all of the highways, back roads, and landmarks inside of you. After taking a quiz that tests your body of knowledge, you'll learn about all of your blood-pumping, food-digesting, and keys-remembering systems and organs.      Just as important, you'll get the facts and advice you need to keep your body running long and strong. You'll find out how diseases start and how they affect your body -- as well as advice on how to prevent and beat conditions that threaten your quality of life. Complete with exercise tips, nutritional guidelines, simple lifestyle changes, and alternative approaches, You: The Owner's Manual gives you an easy, comprehensive, and life-changing how-to plan for fending off the gremlins of aging. To top it off, you'll also get the great-tasting and calorie-saving Owner's Manual Diet -- a thirty-recipe eating plan that's designed with only one goal in mind: to help you live a younger life.     Welcome to your body. Why don't you come on in and take a look around?",

You can shape your household into a functional, supportive, stimulating and safe place -- a place that you and your kids are happy to call home.  With innovative individual and group exercises, challenging self-appraisals, a Daily Intention Journal, specific guidelines on managing conflict, special material for divorced and blended families, and much more, the workbook will show you how to be the best role model, guide and advocate for your child.  Dr. Phil makes you ask yourself the hard questions, and he reveals the hard truths. You are raising America's future; you must invest the time and energy to do it right.

        "Authors": "By Blanchard, Kenneth H. (EDT), Ballard, Jim, Lacinak, Thad, and Tompkins, Chuck",
        "Description": "A compendium of straightforward techniques on how to accentuate the positive and redirect the negative, increasing productivity at work and at home.What do your people at work and your spouse and kids at home have in common with a five-ton killer whale? Probably a whole lot more than you think, according to top business consultant and mega-bestselling author Ken Blanchard and his coauthors from SeaWorld. In this moving and inspirational new book, Blanchard explains that both whales and people perform better when you accentuate the positive. He shows how using the techniques of animal trainers -- specifically those responsible for the killer whales of SeaWorld -- can supercharge your effectiveness at work and at home. When gruff business manager and family man Wes Kingsley visited SeaWorld, he marveled at the ability of the trainers to get these huge killer whales, among the most feared predators in the ocean, to perform amazing acrobatic leaps and dives. Later, talking to the chief trainer, he learned their techniques of building trust, accentuating the positive, and redirecting negative behavior -- all of which make these extraordinary performances possible. Kingsley took a hard look at his own often accusatory management style and recognized how some of his shortcomings as a manager, spouse, and father actually diminish trust and damage relationships. He began to see the difference between \"GOTcha\" (catching people doing things wrong) and \"Whale Done!\" (catching people doing things right). In Whale Done!, Ken Blanchard shows how to make accentuating the positive and redirecting the negative the best tools to increase productivity, instead of creating situations that demoralize people. These techniques are remarkably easy to master and can be applied equally well at home, allowing readers to become better parents and more committed spouses in their happier and more successful personal lives.",

        "Description": "The Millionaires' Unit is the story of a gilded generation of young men from the zenith of privilege: a Rockefeller, a Taft, the son of the head of the Union Pacific Railroad, a son of J.P. Morgan's leading partner, and several who counted friends and relatives among presidents and statesmen of the day. Most were students at Yale in 1916, striving for rewards on the athletic fields, in school organizations, and in Skull & Bones. They had it all and, remarkably by modern standards, they were prepared to risk it all to fight a distant war in France.Driven by the belief that their membership in the American elite required certain sacrifices, schooled in heroism and the nature of leadership, they were determined to be first into the conflict, leading the way ahead of America's declaration that it would join the Great War in Europe. At the heart of the group was the Yale flying club, six of whose members are the heroes of this book. They would share rivalries over girlfriends, jealousies over membership in Skull & Bones, and fierce ambition to be the most daring young man over the battlefields of France, where the casualties among flyers were chillingly high.One of the six would go on to become the principal architect of America's first strategic bomber force. Another became the navy's only Air Ace. Others would bring home decorations and tales of the high life in Paris. Some would not return, having made the greatest sacrifice of all. The members of the Millionaires' Unit shared a stirring, romantic adventure - together growing from boys into leaders in the first terrible, modern war, putting their lives on the line because they believed in the cause and in the idea that it was their duty to do so.",
