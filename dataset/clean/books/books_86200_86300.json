As Andrew Meier explains in this utterly compelling account, the most recent Chechen war actually broke out on New Year's Eve in 1994 when Boris Yeltsin sent hundreds of tanks to the center of the city of Grozny in an effort to quell popular demands for independence from Russia. Six years later, Meier, braving great personal danger, traveled to the scene of one of the largest civilian massacres carried out by Russian troops, reporting on the carnage in which over 60 Chechen civiliansincluding a pregnant woman and many elderlywere brutally slaughtered in one of the war's most horrific \"mop-up\" operations. Days after a Chechen woman became the conflict's first female suicide bomber, Meier visited this war-torn province, encountering, among others, kidnappers, Wahhabi Islamists aligned with the Taliban, and a stream of Russian mothers arriving at the morgue to identify their fallen soldier sons. Chechnya is Meier's stunning report from a region where the death toll has already exceeded 100,000 people, and a book that attempts to comprehend what compels men to shoot children in the back.",

All we have to do is close our eyes and open our minds....The search for the love of our lives is one we\u2019ve all experienced. Those of us who feel we just can\u2019t find what we\u2019re looking for often get stuck in a rut of negative beliefs, unfulfilled needs, and blame. Instead of looking within ourselves to discover who we truly are and what we desire, we often look to someone else \u201cout there\u201d to make us happy and whole. We bury our true needs, play games, and try to be someone we\u2019re not. The result is that we keep playing out the same unhealthy pattern, attracting more of what we don\u2019t really want, bringing ourselves only more frustration, loneliness, and pain.Meditation counselor Kathy Freston has been through that vicious cycle herself \u2013 and finally broke free. In this honest, compassionate, and wise book, she illuminates the path to greater self-awareness \u2013 and the real love we all crave.  Not a pat book of \u201cdating advice\u201d or a guide to manipulating others, Expect a Miracle is a wholly new kind of guide to the search for a great relationship, one that puts the focus back where it belongs: on our own personal transformation. Using principles from Eastern philosophy, meditation, A Course in Miracles, twelve-step recovery, and psychotherapy, the book helps us to become magnetic to the perfect relationship that awaits us. With exercises, meditations, inspiring real stories, and the warm candor of a wise friend, Expect a Miracle is a positive, practical, and powerful book for all of us who are still looking for that one great love \u2013 the one that starts with a spiritual journey within.",

        "Description": "From Geronimo! to gesundheit to haminahamina to holy mackerel, and from abracadabra to zoinks, Mark Dunn and Sergio Aragon\u00e9s show you interjections like you've never seen them before.Often thought of as unnecessary verbal fringe or simply linguistic decoration, interjections (ahem, howdy, mamma mia, pshaw, tally-ho, whoop-de-do) may well be the most overlooked part of speech in the English language. ZOUNDS! A Browser's Dictionary of Interjections focuses the spotlight on this most deserving (and sometimes most demented) grammatical group. A light-hearted look at more than 500 interjections, ZOUNDS! explores the origins of these essential words and highlights the contributions of these previously unheralded parts of speech.Perfect for both word lovers and the casual reader, ZOUNDS! brings together the linguistic talents of Mark Dunn, author of the award-winning novel Ella Minnow Pea, and the graphic hilarity of Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, the legendary cartoonist and contributor to Mad Magazine, for a delightful romp through grammar, culture, and the English language.Famous interjections include:\"Eureka!\"-Archimedes  \"Badabing-badaboom\"-Tony Soprano\"Stuff and nonsense!\"-Alice, Alice in Wonderland\"Bah! Humbug!\"-Scrooge\"Fiddle-dee-dee !\"-Scarlett O'Hara\"Leapin' lizards!\"-Little Orphan Annie\"Nanoo, nanoo\"-Mork, from \"Mork & Mindy\"\"Dyn-O-Mite!\"-Jimmie Walker, \"Good Times\"\"Bully!\"-President Theodore Roosevelt",

Her husband, a cop, lay dead on the couch with four bullet holes in his head. Her infant son lay dead in his crib. Janice seemed unaware of the carnage around her. There was no question she had killed them, but was she criminally responsible or certifiably insane?  In Arthur W. Bahr's Certifiably Insane, that is the question forensic psychologist Simon Rose must answer. He must determine whether the real Janice is a pitiful and psychotic aging cheerleader or a shrewd and conniving evil actress. But Simon's experience and considerable expertise haven't prepared him for the likes of Janice Jensen. She shuns analysis, confounds his clinical judgment -- and provokes intense and conflicting emotions.  Kate Newhouse, Janice's defense attorney and Simon's best friend, suspects the problem is that Simon is attracted to Janice. Kate pleads insanity on behalf of her client, but Simon remains unconvinced. Determined to uncover the truth, he finds that he must first revisit his past and come face to face with his own demons.  Surprising secrets, both ugly and beautiful, are uncovered as Simon pulls his family and friends into the psychological circus of Janice's life -- and into danger. Tenderness and rage, friendship and manipulation, seduction and love -- these are the passions that drive the principal players as they unravel the strands of a complicated, violent personality.",

        "Description": "Orson Welles was once asked which directors he most admired. He replied: \"The old masters. By which I mean John Ford, John Ford and John Ford.\" John Ford (1894?1973) was a legend in his own time. Honored with four Academy Awards for best director, and two others for his World War II documentaries, Ford directed more than 140 films in a career that lasted from the early silent era through the late 1960s. Ford today is celebrated throughout the world as the cinema's foremost chronicler of American history, the leading poet of the Western genre, and a wide-ranging filmmaker of profound emotional impact. His classic films?such as Stagecoach, The Grapes of Wrath, Has Green Was My Valley, The Quiet Man, The Searchers, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance?remain widely popular, and he has been acknowledged as a major influence by such leading contemporary filmmakers as Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, Elia Kazan, Samuel Fuller, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Oliver Stone, and Peter Bogdanovich.In this groundbreaking and influential work of Ford criticism, Joseph McBride and Michael Wilmington provide an overview of Ford's career as well as in-depth analyses of key Ford films, from his first feature, the 1917 Straight Shooting, to his last, the controversial Seven Women. Analyzing recurring Fordian themes and relating each film to his entire body of work, the authors insightfully explore the full richness of Ford's tragicomic vision of history.",

Happens all the time, the lawyer said.To Dek Elstrom, broke and huddling in a cold stone turret in the middle of February, the sound of seven hundred falling down his chimney is louder than his voice of reason.

And something worse: links to the darkest part of his own past. He races to chase down leads to the killer, and his own ghost\u2026before the dead woman is killed again.",

        "Description": "After Bourne is ambushed and nearly killed while in Indonesia, he fakes his death to take on a new identity and mission- to find out who is trying to assassinate him. In the process, Bourne begins to question who he really is and what he would become if he no longer carried the Bourne identity. Across the globe, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt-apparently by an Iranian missile-leaving the world wondering if it was an accident or an act of aggression. A massive global team lead by Soraya Moore is assembled to investigate the attack before the situation escalates.  When Bourne's search for his would-be assassin intersects with Soraya's search for the group behind the airplane bombing, Bourne is thrust into a race to prevent a new world war.  But it may already be too late.",

There are entries on such famous cat lovers as Florence Nightingale and Brigitte Bardot; cat haters, including William Shakespeare and President Dwight Eisenhower; and cat fearers, ranging from Alexander the Great to Napoleon Bonaparte.
