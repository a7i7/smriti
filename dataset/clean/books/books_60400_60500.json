        "Description": "After her brilliant detective debut in Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor, there can be no doubt that Jane Austen would have made aremarkable sleuth. And so, with great aplomb, Stephanie Barron reveals the next superb Jane Austen Mystery... Jane Austen and her family are looking forward to a peaceful late-summer holiday in the seaside village of Lyme Regis. But on the road thither, a fearful storm and an overturned carriage lead the shaken travelers to seek refuge at High Down Grange. And there, in a dismal manor house wrapt in an air of malevolent neglect, Jane meets the darkly forbidding yet strangely attractive master of High Down Grange, Mr. Geoffrey Sidmouth. What murky secrets does the brooding Mr. Sidmouth hope to preserve behind his fierce glower? And who is the exceedingly lovely young woman dressed in peasant garb who shares his home? Once settled in town, Jane seeks to learn the answers. Yet common gossip is soon forgotten when a man is found hanged from a makeshift gibbet by the sea. Only the day before, Jane had observed this same man in a heated exchange with Mr. Sidmouth. Still, the worthies of Lyme are certain the labourer's death is the work of \"the Reverend,\" the notorious ringleader of the midnight smuggling trade. The Reverend's identity is the paramount mystery of Lyme Regis.\u00a0\u00a0And Jane, who can never resist a puzzle, is determined to solve this one. But to her dismay, she must soon admit that she harbours a strange sensibility for a man who could very well be a murderer. And then a second mysterious death draws her into a perilous scheme to entrap and expose Geoffrey Sidmouth. From the drawing- rooms of the cultured and the devious to secret caverns and coarse haunts, her mission will take her far from a lady's proper venue...until even so canny a student of character and valiant adventurer must ask herself: \"Is the prize worth the risk--to my heart as well as my person?\" Stylish, suspenseful, and wickedly diverting, Jane and the Man of the Cloth delves deep into the foibles, passions, and ruthless machinations that lurk within the most polite society.",

A year before, a stunning Swedish student disappeared from Oxfordshire, leaving behind a rucksack with her identification. As the lady was dishy, young, and traveling alone, the Thames Valley Police suspected foul play. But without a body, and with precious few clues, the investigation ground to a halt. Now it seems that someone who can hold back no longer is composing clue-laden poetry that begins an enthusiastic correspondence among England's news-reading public. Not one to be left behind, Morse writes a letter of his own--and follows a twisting path through the Wytham Woods that leads to a most shocking murder.",

        "Description": "Philip Zaleski, an acclaimed writer and the editor of the series, has once again assembled an outstanding collection of thirty-five pieces that range far and wide in subject matter and style. In \u201cThe Cellular Church,\u201d Malcolm Gladwell takes a look at the pastor Rick Warren, and Mary Gordon\u2019s \u201cMoral Fiction\u201d explores the place of value judgments in literature. Michael Chabon describes his childhood fascination with the darkness and \u201csilliness\u201d that pervade the world of the Norse gods, and Katherine Paterson, an award-winning children's book writer, describes how faith plays a role in her work. Miles Hoffman and Wendell Berry both decry the loss of soul, the former speaking of modern music and its dire need for a miracle, and the latter of modern agriculture, which has strayed perilously far from its roots. The range of the volume is immense, stretching from Edward Hoagland\u2019s discussion of America's social breakdown to Helen Tworkov\u2019s analysis of the inherent conflict between feminism and Buddhism to Corby Kummer\u2019s deliciously simple recipe for kosher almond cake.  The poems, too, run the gamut of human experience, with contributions from such distinguished poets as Mark Doty, Charles Martin, V. Penelope Pelizzon, Louis Simpson, C. K. Williams, and John Updike. The Best American Spiritual Writing 2006 is sure to please not only lovers of spiritual writing, but also those who long for writing that illuminates a vast range of issues beyond our immediate line of sight.",

        "Description": "Boston, 1919. It's been a terrible year for thirteen-year-old Joshua Harper. The influenza pandemic that's sweeping the world has claimed his father's life; his voice has changed, so he can't sing in the Boston Boys' Choir anymore; and now money is tight, so he must quit school to get a job. It's not fair!  Joshua begins working as a newspaper boy, hawking papers on the street, but he soon finds himself competing with Charlestown Charlie, a tough, streetwise boy who does not make things easier for Joshua. It seems that fitting in is not as easy as it once was. Then disaster strikes the city of Boston. Joshua must do what he can to help, and in doing so he finds the place -- and the voice -- that he thought he'd lost.",

        "Description": "For 1,600 years its message lay hidden. When the bound papyrus pages of this lost gospel finally reached scholars who could unlock its meaning, they were astounded. Here was a gospel that had not been seen since the early days of Christianity, and which few experts had even thought existed\u2013a gospel told from the perspective of Judas Iscariot, history\u2019s ultimate traitor. And far from being a villain, the Judas that emerges in its pages is a hero.In this radical reinterpretation, Jesus asks Judas to betray him. In contrast to the New Testament Gospels, Judas Iscariot is presented as a role model for all those who wish to be disciples of Jesus. He is the one apostle who truly understands Jesus.This volume is the first publication of the remarkable gospel since it was condemned as heresy by early Church leaders, most notably by St. Irenaeus, in 180. Hidden away in a cavern in Middle Egypt, the codex (or book) containing the gospel was discovered by farmers in the 1970s. In the intervening years the papyrus codex was bought and sold by antiquities traders, hidden away, and carried across three continents, all the while suffering damage that reduced much of it to fragments. In 2001, it finally found its way into the hands of a team of experts who would painstakingly reassemble and restore it.The Gospel of Judas has been translated from its original Coptic in clear prose, and is accompanied by commentary that explains its fascinating history in the context of the early Church, offering a whole new way of understanding the message of Jesus Christ.",

        "Description": "Clear, comprehensive, and highly readable, Half the Human Experience presents a balanced perspective on multidisciplinary issues and provides an authoritative analysis of classical and current research from a feminist psychology viewpoint. Hyde examines the balance of cultural and biological similarities (and differences) between the genders, noting how these characteristics may affect issues of equality, and also how men and women behave towards one another. By putting into context the proliferation of research in the field and clearly explaining the relationship between gender and emotion, the author helps demystify the scientific process and study of feminist psychology. Students receive a strong foundation for understanding the influences of gender, race, and ethnicity on psychology and society, as well as strategies for thinking critically about pop culture versus academic feminism as it relates to psychology.Unique in the field, a chapter on \"Gender and Emotion\" incorporates the cutting-edge research now available on these important issues. This chapter covers gender stereotypes about emotions, ethnic differences in emotion stereotypes, gender differences in emotional experience and expression, and the ways in which gendered emotional expression is socialized.Expanded ethnicity coverage builds on one of the text's key strengths and ensures the most comprehensive multicultural coverage. \"Women of Color,\" an entire chapter, is devoted to describing the cultures of the four major U.S. ethnic groups. Ethnicity coverage also is integrated throughout all other chapters of the text.\"Gender and Depression\" section in Chapter 15 has been reworked, taking a developmental approach and incorporating the very latest theories and data.Chapter-opening quotations engage students' interest with compelling and thought-provoking statements that relate to the chapter content.Experience the Research boxes encourage students to engage in hands-on research activities, such as collecting data from friends or replicating an experiment. These activities relate to the content covered in the chapter, bringing concepts to life through practical implementation. Focus boxes, which introduce research and theory in the form of case studies, highlight issues raised in the chapter in a more concentrated manner. Topics include \"A Letter from a Battered Wife,\" \"Sexism in Language,\" and \"Women and Computers: The New Frontier of Gender Differences?\"Marginal glossary terms appear at point of use in the main text. A full glossary is also available at the end of the text.End-of-chapter material includes In Conclusion (brief summary paragraphs of key points), Suggestions for Further Reading, and Women and the Web sections, which provide descriptions of three to four key web resources related to the topics in the chapter.",

The bitter civil war between the Nationalists and the Republicans has interrupted his legal studies in Salamanca. Second son of a conservative Southern family of landowners, he is an enthusiast for the Catholic Franquista cause, a dedicated, and now triumphant, Nationalist. This war has drawn international attention. In a dress rehearsal for World War II, fascists support the Nationalists, while communists have come to the aid of the Republicans. Atrocities have devastated both sides. It is at this moment, when the Republicans have surrendered, and the Guardia Civil has begun to impose order in the ruins of Madrid, that Tejada finds the body of his best friend, a hero of the siege of Toledo, shot to death on a street named Amor de Dios. Naturally, a Red is suspected. And it is easy for Tejada to assume that the woman caught kneeling over the body is the killer. But when his doubts are aroused, he cannot help seeking justice.",

A woman either can open the book to any page, find a single uncomplicated message, and then close the book to go about her busy life or she can enjoy a progression of these gentle, uncomplicated messages as she reads through the entire book in an hour or less. Among the concepts to be explored are:The core desires and crucial question in the heart of every woman. A woman was created to be the image bearer of God; her essence is beauty. Because of the Fall, women may become controlling, indulging, fearful, desolate. Now women need mercy and repentance.All women have been wounded, assaulted. Underneath every controlling, indulging, fearful, or desolate woman is a wounded little girl.Women need healing and restoration. Women need to reject the messages of their wounds and instead embrace their new identity as God's glorious daughters.Women are meant to be beloved and are meant to play an irreplaceable role in the romantic adventure of life.",
