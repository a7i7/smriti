His trial was a Roman circus. The chief gladiators were two great legal giants of the century. Like two bull elephants locked in mortal combat, they bellowed and roared imprecations and abuse. The spectators sat uneasily in the sweltering heat with murder in their hearts, barely able to restrain themselves. At stake was the freedom of every American.

No! . . . Stop that! Miss Johansson, I said, \"Please hold my calls . . .\" Honestly. Hollywood! Anyway, what you are about to read--or have read to you--is a new book that is the first active collaboration of the Monty Python chaps for many, many years. In fact, the first book written and produced by the Pythons, themselves, since 1979. No, they are not all dead. Okay, some of them have been a bit quiet recently, and one or two have DNR notes by their bedsides, but the point is five of them are still technically alive and that, if not exactly cause for rejoicing, may well be cause for a new book. And this is it! So hold whatever you like in your right hand while you read this book. Because laughter is jolly good for you. Even if it can make you blind. --The Pythons",

As David plays reluctant witness (and more) to James and Ruth's escalating love affair, he must come to terms with his own blighted emotional life. Set in the London art scene awash with new money and intellectual pretension, in the sleek galleries and posh restaurants of a Britannia resurgent with cultural and economic power, Nick Laird's insightful and drolly satirical novel vividly portrays three people whose world gradually fractures along the ineluctable fault lines of desire, truth, deceit, and jealousy. With wit, compassion, and acuity, Laird explores the very nature of contemporary romance-\"The Death of Love in Modern Culture,\" as David puts it in one of his dyspeptic blog posts-among damaged souls whose hearts and heads never quite line up long enough for them to achieve true happiness.",

Available in five volumes for greater flexibility, the Fifth Edition offers thematic clusters to stimulate classroom discussions and to show the treatment of important topics across the genres. The indispensable web site includes revised timelines, a multimedia gallery to support thematic clusters, and a searchable Instructor's Guide.The thematic cluster, \"Humor of the Old Southwest,\" features works by Davy Crockett, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Alice Cary.Authors include Major George Lowery, the second chief of the Eastern Cherokee; John Ross; Lorenzo de Zavala; and Nancy Gardner Prince.Selections include \"The Maldive Shark,\" by Herman Melville, \"Ar'n't I a Woman?\" by Sojourner Truth, and \"Hints to Young Wives\" by Fanny Fern (Sara Willis Parton).Walt Whitman's \"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,\" previously omitted from important literary canons, is offered as a rich selection of the \"American Renaissance.\"",

Others suffer so many symptoms\u2014 severe hot flashes, sleeplessness, mood swings\u2014that they have trouble functioning. But what all women have in common is a need to know what to expect and how to understand this phase for its inherent promise: as a grand beginning to the second half of life.  By poring over the latest research, interviewing doctors and scientists, attending conferences, and talking to other women, Pat Wingert and Barbara Kantrowitz offer the everything-you-need-to-know guide to menopause. IS IT HOT IN HERE? OR IS IT ME? is accessible, comprehensive, practical, reassuring, scientific, and written in the lively, smart voice of friends helping friends.  First comes the overview: the beginnings of menopause, including why knowing if you\u2019re actually in menopause can be so tricky; the stages of menopause and their typical duration; the role of hormones and the viability of hormone therapy; when and why to seek treatment, the risks involved, and a primer on pills, creams, patches, shots, and bioidenticals.  Then, at the heart of the book, two essential sections: \u201cWhat You\u2019re Feeling Now,\u201d which offers the relief of solid information on the symptoms of your menopausal life\u2014hot flashes, insomnia, mood swings, bleeding, memory loss, and those inexplicable glitches in thinking that make you feel like a kid with ADD\u2014plus the comfort of advice on what to do. And \u201cStaying Healthy Forever,\u201d a jam-packed guide to caring for your changing body: It begins by trusting your knowledge of yourself, then learning the things to do to ensure a long and healthy future, one in which you look your best and feel your best. No matter what your path through menopause, the experience is one of great change: and now for this great change, great help.",

They shared everything with her - their likes and dislikes, what they wanted, why they behaved in certain ways, even the town gossip.Years later, compelled by a heartfelt love for animals, Sonya has now devoted her life to helping them. In What the Animals Tell Me, she describes the events which led her to her true calling as an animal communicator, and, in fascinating detail, she shares the remarkable stories of her amazing work with animals and the many people who have sought her guidance in establishing better communication with their pets.In What the Animals Tell Me, you'll learn about your pet's innermost thoughts and feelings because Sonya treats you to insights that come right from \"the horse's mouth.\" You'll read about a cat named Larkspur whose distress over his owners' busy schedules led to numerous accidents; how a puppyhood filled with cruelty caused Amadeus to attack others; how Zuki, a baby iguana, fell ill from another iguana's intense jealousy; and how the lost puppy Sugar was miraculously recovered after telepathically communicating her whereabouts to Sonya. You'll even read hilarious stories from pets who tattle on their owners.In addition, Sonya gives step-by-step instructions on how to establish a telepathic link with your pet, and to look at things from your animal's point of view. This improved communication can be used to address behavior problems of al kinds, and it will enable you to understand your pet better, so that you may enjoy a closer, more rewarding relationship with your furry (or featherly or scaly) friend.",

Most of us will never get to see this memo, but we know it exists.Now, editor Stephen Elliott, authors Jason Roberts, Eric Martin, and Andrew Altschul, and a team of twenty researchers have re-created this document for the present day. Where to Invade Next contains seven essays, 100 percent factual, laying out in stark detail how the arguments for invasion could be made.

Hall, Jr., Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and Italian, Cornell University, has compiled\u00a0a stimulating and representative collection ranging from a 14th-century selection from Boccaccio's The Decameron to Alberto Moravia's \"Competition,\" a 20th-century view of lower-and middle-class Italian life. Among the other works are Machiavelli's \"Belfagor; Story of the Devil Who Took a Wife,\" Matteo Bandello's reflections of 16th-century morals in \"Madonna Zilia,\" Giovanni Verga's objective portrayal of lower-class Sicilian life in \"Rosso Malpelo,\" Gabriele d'Annunzio's revelations of a depraved peasantry in \"The Idolaters,\" Luigi Pirandello's fascinating study of hypocritical social attitudes in \"The Tight Frock Coat,\" as well as equally significant works by Antonio Fogazzaro, Renato Fucini, Aldo Palazzeschi, and Corrado Alvaro. Arranged chronologically so that the growth of the literary art may be followed, as well as enjoyed, each story is prefaced by a concise biographical/critical introduction. Also included are linguistic and cultural notes, a valuable Italian-English vocabulary, study questions on each story, and an informative essay on Italian fiction. Students of the Italian language will find the dual-language format timesaving and extremely helpful; readers of Italian literature will want to add this treasury of small masterworks to their personal libraries.",

THE WILD BLUE brings to life another extraordinary band of brothers - the men who volunteered to join the American Air Force and undertook some of the most demanding and dangerous jobs in the war.  Focusing on the men of the 741st Bomb Squadron and, in particular, the crew of the DAKOTA QUEEN, these are the boys turned pilots, bombardiers, navigators and gunners of the B24s, who suffered 50 per cent casualties during conflict.  With his extraordinary talent for bringing alive the action and tension of combat, Ambrose sweeps us along in the B24s as their crews fought to the death to reach their targets and destroy the German war machine.",
