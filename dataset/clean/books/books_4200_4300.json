        "Description": "The genetic age is upon us, yet most people have only a limited understanding of the wondrous chemical that encodes the formula for all living things. As DNA's secrets are revealed, they must be rescued from the obscuring language of science, and now Signs of Life does just that. Borrowing from the humanities, Robert Pollack offers an entirely fresh perspective: DNA, he argues, should be seen as a great work of natural literature, a three-billion-year-old, continuously evolving text.An award-winning scientist and teacher, Pollack displays both a sophisticated understanding of biology and a remarkable gift for metaphor. In elegant prose, he shows precisely how DNA provides the instruction book for life. He takes us deep inside a living cell - a teeming walled city - and explains how the genetic script at its heart governs all its operations. He opens the book containing the human genome and lucidly reveals the process by which biologists and physicians have begun to read its words and sentences.But the frontier of genetics now extends into troubling territory. Pollack identifies several areas of concern: the ambitious but flawed Human Genome Project, the widespread access to individual genetic data, the temptation to manipulate genetic codes to make them \"better.\" Given our still-crude ability to interpret these living texts, our eagerness to rewrite them is alarming. The power to change the human genome brings with it enormous responsibilities, and Pollack offers persuasive evidence that if we fail to achieve a fuller understanding of the multiple meanings of DNA, we risk disaster.Signs of Life is both a brilliant illumination of a biological text and a provocative meditation on our awesome new ability to alter it. With the grace of a born writer and teacher, Robert Pollack has written a book that will change the way people think about science, genetics, and the future of our species.",

        "Authors": "By Wideman, John Edgar",
        "Description": "Hoop Roots is John Edgar Wideman\u2019s memoir of discovering the game that has been his singular passion for nearly fifty years. It is equally, inevitably, the story of the roots of black basketball in America ? a story inextricable from race, culture, love, and home.   As a boy, Wideman lived in his grandparents\u2019 worn but welcoming home in the ghettoized Homewood section of Pittsburgh. It was a world presided over by women, forever coddling, scolding, protective. One day John slipped away from their watchful gaze and escaped to a place where white factory workers shot hoops on their breaks. Then someone handed him a ball. That thrilling first shot was a turning point. Later he sneaked from his dying grandmother\u2019s bedside to the courts where other black boys gathered. Here he really learned the game ? the African-American game, whose style and power would change him and our culture.   With Du Bois\u2019s The Souls of Black Folk as his model, Wideman combines memoir with history, folklore, and commentary to create a magical evocation of his unique slice of American experience. He imagines the Harlem Globetrotters in 1927, on their way to the Illinois town where the only black resident will be lynched. A playground game in Greenwich Village conjures Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and the sources of black minstrelsy. African-American language, culture, music, and sport brilliantly interweave in a lyrical narrative that glides from nostalgic to outraged, from scholarly to streetwise, from defiant to celebratory.   Like his previous memoirs, Wideman\u2019s Hoop Roots is both deeply personal and fiercely resonant.",

        "Title": "Boiling Point: Democrats, Republicans, and the Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity",
        "Authors": "By Phillips, Kevin P.",
        "Description": "In the election of 1992, support for George Bush plunged to a level below Herbert Hoover's in 1932 as many middle-class suburbs voted Democratic and Ross Perot surged. In this book, Kevin Phillips shows how this populist explosion revealed a powerful new political force: widespread frustration over the decline of middle-class prosperity and the threat to the American dream.Teenage homelessness in the Chicago suburbs ... crumpled home values in Southern California ... the worst job market for college graduates in New York City since the Great Depression: It all added up to the sharpest economic decline in decades, provoking political unrest unequaled in sixty years. There had been declines before, but no previous postwar downturn so damaged the white middle class as a whole or raised such fears that Americans might lose the unique economic privileges that they have enjoyed since World War II. Boiling Point shows in dismaying detail what has happened to the middle class since the 1970s in disposable income, earnings, home values, job prospects, public services, assets and net worth, pension safety and health insurance, and the next generation's prospects of enjoying the same rising living standards and upward mobility as its parents had. And it was not a natural result of adverse global trends but of deliberate political choices.In the Reagan-Bush years American leaders who had once spoken up for the average family were celebrating investors, speculators, and the rich, shifting the burden of taxes from the wealthy to the middle class while starving public services and disregarding the growing debt that would punish future generations.The populist anger so vivid in 1992 is not a onetime phenomenon. It will persist, Phillips says, until the middle class resumes the road to prosperity under government policies that it considers fair. It is on this that the politics of the 1990s now depends.",

Using the lens of gender, connections between mothers and daughters, fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, and husbands and wives are analyzed and given new meaning. The authors evaluate and redefine family transitions such as divorce, single-parent and female-headed households, and remarried couples who are attempting to integrate their respective children with ex-spouses and complicated networks of extended kin. They also reexamine traditional and emerging roles for women in their early, middle, and later years. Written in an engaging format, each chapter features an in depth analysis of how gender shapes the relationship in question. This discussion is followed by fascinating vignettes of actual cases from each of the four authors, whose approaches reflect different orientations to therapy.",

Their romance, seemingly shattered on the eve of the millennium, is played out against the tale of two old lovers lost to each other for a half century. These intertwined lives gather history and time itself into a narrative of intelligence and wit, where truth surfaces - as it will - both to wound and to heal. Woven into the stories of these young and old lovers are glimpses of the New York art scene and the uneasy cohabitation of art and technology. In seamless entries on the exploits of formative geniuses, from Ben Franklin to Robert Oppenheimer, the novel also brings the desire for progress into perspective with the limited dreams of private life.",

Now he ventures into bold, new territory with his biggest and best novel yet. A Cold Heart features Kellerman\u2019s brilliant signature style\u2014but in this tour-de-force he mines even deeper the emotional landscape of his characters: psychologist-sleuth Alex Delaware, LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis, Milo\u2019s colleague Petra Connor, and Alex\u2019s ex-lover, Robin Castagna\u2014bringing them all vividly to life as never before.\u201cI\u2019ve got a weird one, so naturally I thought of you,\u201d says Milo Sturgis, summoning his friend Alex to the trendy gallery where a promising young artist has been brutally garroted on the night of her first major showing. What makes it \u201ca weird one\u201d is the lack of any obvious motive, and the luridly careful staging of the murder scene\u2014which immediately suggests to Alex not an impulsive crime of passion . . . but the meticulous and taunting modus operandi of a serial killer. Delaware\u2019s suspicion is borne out when he compares notes with Milo\u2019s associate, Petra Connor, and her new partner, a strange, taciturn detective with a past of his own named Eric Stahl. The Hollywood cops are investigating the vicious death of Baby Boy Lee, a noted blues guitarist, fatally stabbed after a late-night set at a local club. What links Baby Boy\u2019s murder with that of painter Juliet Kipper is the shadowy presence of an abrasive fanzine writer. This alias-shrouded critic\u2019s love-the-art/disdain-the-artist philosophy and his morbid fascination with the murders leads Alex and the detectives to suspect they\u2019re facing a new breed of celebrity stalker: one with a fetish for snuffing out rising stars.Tracking down the killer proves to be maddening, with the twisting trail leading from halfway houses to palatial mansions and from a college campus to the last place Alex ever expected: the doorstep of his ex-lover Robin Castagna, whose business association with two of the victims casts her as an unavoidable player in the unfolding case. As more and more killings are discovered, unraveling the maddening puzzle assumes a chilling new importance\u2014stopping a vicious psychopath who\u2019s made cold-blood murder his chosen art form.",

        "Description": "\"There was never any doubt in my mind that if I went after osteoporosis, I could control it and lead a healthy life. That's my message to other women: No one can do this for you-you've got to do it for yourself. And you can.\"  (Ann Richards)  Forty-four million Americans, thirty million of whom are women, will face osteoporosis in some form. Often triggered by hormonal changes that occur after menopause, osteoporosis results in the fracturing of bones, which can prove fatal to the elderly. One out of every six affected women will break her hip; only one out of three will regain her independence.  In 1994, after falling and fracturing her hand, Ann Richards went for a bone density test. She was diagnosed with osteopenia, an early stage of osteoporosis. After witnessing both of her grandmothers and her mother fall victim to the disease, Richards was determined to overcome its incapacitating effects. She began a physician-approved regimen of medication and dramatically changed her lifestyle.  In I'm Not Slowing Down, the former Texas governor, known for her saucy straight talk, and leading osteoporosis authority Sydney Lou Bonnick tell women what they need to know to combat this devastating disease.  Nearly a decade after her original diagnosis, Richards's bone density remains essentially stable. Readers will benefit from advice on everything from diet to exercise to the individual histories that must precede the implementation of any bone-building program if women are to begin the second act of their lives with strength, agility, and confidence.",

        "Description": "An unprecedented biography, drawn from the author's exclusive access to high-ranking defectors, intelligence officials, and even Saddam's own relatives -- fully illustrated with photos from his early life to the presentTwo weeks before September 11, 2001, Saddam Hussein placed his troops on their highest military alert since the Gulf War. As al-Qaeda terrorists set their attacks on America in motion, the Iraqi dictator was prepared to go to war for a second time with the United States. How did an illegitimate child from Tikrit become the West's greatest adversary, and one of the most dangerous and murderous dictators of modem times?Saddam: King of Terror is the most insightful and illuminating portrait of the Iraqi president to date-and a fascinating study of the making of a tyrant. Con Coughlin, executive editor of London's award-winning Sunday Telegraph, has covered the Middle East for decades -- on the front lines, narrowly escaping kidnapping and violence. He has cultivated exclusive contacts among the Western intelligence community and numerous defectors from Saddam's inner circles -- including former generals, political associates, and bodyguards as well as childhood friends. Coughlin knew immediately that American and British declarations of war against terrorism after the September 11th attacks would sooner rather than later encompass Saddam Hussein as well as Osama bin Laden. Coughlin shows that any operation against terrorism will be incomplete as long as Saddam remains in power -- that international policies will have to change from cautious tolerance to active intervention, a change that is already becoming a reality.Coughlin also provides the first complete portrait of Saddam's childhood ever published, compiled from the author's inter-views with Saddam's contemporaries and relatives who have never before spoken publicly about him According to Coughlin, Saddam has a younger sister no one knew about, and he idolizes his mother, although his childhood was deeply marred by his shame about being fatherless. From his earliest years, he looked to his mother's brother as a father figure, and Coughlin tells how it was this uncle who first introduced Saddam to a life of crime and political rebellion. Saddam: King of Terror meticulously traces Saddam's bloody rise to power, from Saddam's first murder and his time in prison, to an eyewitness account of Saddam storming Iraqs presidential palace in a tank, to his almost feral ruthlessness in disposing of his opponents, even dose friends and relatives, to create his regime -- a complex mechanism in which family and tribe are central, held together by Saddam's carefully orchestrated reign of fear.In Saddam: King of Terror, we see both the bizarre, almost pathological behavior of an international pariah and the unshakable power of a tyrant who has defied the world's censure and holds a nation in his grasp.",

        "Description": "Contrary to most media reports, negative campaigning is actually in decline, but our political system is no better off for it. Or so believes Washington Post political writer Dana Milbank, whose campaign book Smashmouth provides a witty yet ultimately very serious look at the sense and senselessness that occurred during the 2000 presidential campaign. What matters is not whether a campaign claim is positive or negative, but whether the claim is relevant,\" writes Milbank. \"The press should police outright falsehoods, of course, but otherwise let the candidates fight it out.\" Traveling by bus, plane and motorcade with the candidates, Milbank provides an indelible behind-the-scenes look at the brutal skirmishes that made up this century's first presidential campaign.",

        "Description": "To Hanako Shimoda, recently divorced, Luciano Pavarotti is a god. To her daughter, Emily, this fixation on Pavarotti is a harmless fantasy, the byproduct of loneliness. Meeting Luciano is the story of what happens when Hanako acts on her fantasy and invites opera star Pavarotti to dinner in their Westchester County home. Emily, with no real career plan, has gone back after college to work at her old summer job - waiting tables at the local Japanese steakhouse. Even worse than wearing a fake kimono and obi is that she's living at home with her mother. At first, her mom seems pretty much her old self - still reliving her Japanese childhood; still affecting the airs of a European sophisticate; still brewing espresso, cooking Italian, and singing arias from Rigoletto while she cleans; still idolizing Luciano Pavarotti.  But when Hanako hires Alex, a handsome Greek, to renovate the kitchen, Emily begins to worry. And when Alex, who seems to be getting very cozy with her mother, spills the secret that the renovation is in preparation for a visit from Pavarotti, Emily is thrown into a wonderfully familiar quandary: how to deal with a parent who might be losing it. First-time novelist Anna Esaki-Smith has a wry, understated approach to the themes of assimilation, growing up, striking out on shaky ground, finding yourself - and loving your mother. Like a reflecting pool in a Japanese garden, Meeting Luciano gradually reveals the beauty of its subtle design.",

        "Authors": "By jones, howard",
        "Description": "This volume presents the first full-scale treatment of the only instance in history where African blacks, seized by slave dealers, won their freedom and returned home.  Jones describes how, in 1839, Joseph Cinqu\u00e9 led a revolt on the Spanish slave ship, the Amistad, in the Caribbean.  The seizure of the ship by an American naval vessel near Montauk, Long Island, the arrest of the Africans in Connecticut, and the Spanish protest against the violation of their property rights created an international controversy.    The Amistad affair united Lewis Tappan and other abolitionists who put the \"law of nature\" on trial in the United States by their refusal to accept a legal system that claimed to dispense justice while permitting artificial distinctions based on race or color.  The mutiny resulted in a trial before the U.S. Supreme Court that pitted former President John Quincy Adams against the federal government. Jones vividly recaptures this compelling drama--the most famous slavery case before Dred Scott--that climaxed in the court's ruling to free the captives and allow them to return to Africa.",

And one of country music's hottest new superstars.Now you can meet the real Travis Tritt, in the very words born of the same mind and soul that gave the world the packed-dirt honesty, no-chaser humor, and full-span lyricism of megahits like \"Here's a Quarter (Call Someone Who Cares),\" \"I'm Gonna Be Somebody,\" \"t.r.o.u.b.l.e.,\" \"The Whiskey Ain't Workin',\" and \"Put Some Drive in Your Country.\" Here is Travis Tritt telling you about his decidedly unglamorous years during which he went through two failed marriages, kept a job loading trucks, and began an unrewarding career in inside sales. Here is Tritt struggling to find his true vocation, lighting his way out of the narrow little box of prejudice that comes with the territory using the best weapon he has... his music.You'll witness Travis Tritt pay righteous dues to the godfathers of his distinctive brand of country and rock, crystal-clear bluegrass, and down-and-dirty blues - men like Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Hank Williams, both senior and junior. You'll be with him on his encounters - mostly friendly, sometimes feuding - with contemporary stars like Merle Haggard, Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels, and Billy Ray Cyrus.Finally, you'll hear Travis Tritt on concerts and the road (\"Your microphone stands serve two functions - making music and de facto weapons\"), on his public and his women (\"All of a sudden, women are throwing themselves at me\"), and on the unending love-hate relationship with the country music circuit and the self-appointed keepers of the flame in Nashville (\"I pretty much had a reputation for being... the type of sleazeball who would actually type up his own contract\"). This is Travis Tritt, the stink of bars with chicken wire stages still on his dusty boots, the superstar singing of the loss and suffering and love that only a one-hundred-proof, New South good ole boy can know up close.",

        "Description": "Following the runaway success of his first nonfiction book, The Sea Hunters, Clive Cussler returns with his legendary fictional hero Dirk Pitt\u00ae -- in a masterfully crafted tale of villainy on the high seas and the Mississippi River that can only enhance his status as the grand master of adventure fiction. The coin of the realm for the wealthy, insatiably greedy Chinese smuggler who is Dirk Pitt's adversary in Flood Tide is human lives: much of his vast fortune has been made smuggling Chinese immigrants into countries around the globe, including the United States. Tracking the smuggler's nefarious activities leads Pitt from Washington State to Louisiana, where his quarry is mysteriously constructing a huge shipping port in the middle of nowhere. Why has he chosen this unlikely location? The trail then leads to the race to find the site of the mysterious sinking of the ship that Chiang Kai-shek filled with treasure when he fled China in 1949, including the legendary boxes containing the bones of Peking Man that had vanished at the beginning of World War I. As Pitt prepares for a final dramatic showdown, he is faced with the most formidable foe he has ever encountered. With a dozen consecutive New York Times bestsellers and over 70 million copies of his books in print, Clive Cussler is one of America's most popular novelists. His latest book is enthralling, intricately plotted, and supremely suspenseful.",

On the wall above him, over a little ledge on which the Puzzel motto was carved, could be seen the discoloured cobwebbed outline of the shield which had fallen to kill him. It lay face down, obscuring the man's head. Two halves of its chain hung from rings on each side. At the end of one was a broken link.Jack Tarrant is a newly retired Scotland Yard detective recovering from a bullet wound and bored with doing nothing but crossword puzzles. His girlfriend Maria hopes that a festive holiday weekend at the snowbound Country House Hotel, Puzzel Manor, will lift his spirits. But Jack can't seem to get away either from his career or the puzzles he loves so much. Soon after he and Maria arrive for their weekend, they find a corpse - and a series of mysterious, fiendish puzzles pitting them against the unknown murderer.The game is murder and the rules are dead simple. To avert further bloodshed, Jack and Maria must find out who among the guests or staff is the Puzzel Manor murderer by following the trail of devious clues before it's too late.Each chapter ends with a puzzle - sometimes an anagram, sometimes a crossword or other word game, sometimes a logic puzzle - and each subsequent solution brings Jack and Maria (and the reader) closer to the murderer's identity.",
