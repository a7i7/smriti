When coals are covered with white ash, place plums, cut side down, and meat over direct heat; cover and grill until meat is well seared, 5 minutes. Then turn pork to sear other side, 5 minutes more, rearranging plums to ensure even browning. Move meat and plums to indirect heat; cover and grill 12 to 13 minutes, or until meat thermometer inserted in thickest end of meat registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nRemove meat and plums to a platter; let sit 5 minutes or up to 1 hour.

Fold the corner closest to you over the meat mixture and roll the wrapper over the mixture 1-1/2 times. Fold in the two opposite side corners and continue rolling the wrapper so it covers these corners, tucking them in. Dip two fingers in the egg whites and brush the remaining corner, pressing it to seal. Repeat these steps with a second egg roll wrapper. Let the egg roll rest briefly so the egg white dries and holds the last corner in place.\nIf the egg rolls will not be served right away, preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a heat-proof dish with paper towels.\nPour the canola oil into a large wok set over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, carefully slip two to three egg rolls into the wok. Cook until the wrappers turn golden brown and bubble slightly, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Use a slotted spoon or strainer to remove from the wok. Place the egg rolls in the prepared dish and put the dish in the heated oven, making sure to remove it after 15 minute or lower the temperature. Continue cooking the remaining egg rolls.\n",
