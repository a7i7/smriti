Set the burner to low heat. The goal is to be able to maintain a consistent temperature between 110 degrees F and 115 degrees F (45 degrees C) for 4 to 6 hours. Check the temperature using a candy or meat thermometer periodically.\nMeanwhile, pour the milk and dry milk into a large saucepan. Stir to dissolve the powder and set over medium heat. Heat until just steaming; your thermometer should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from the heat and place the pan so the bottom is sitting in a bowl of ice water. Cool until the temperature has dropped to 115 degrees F (45 degrees C).\nWhen it reaches the temperature, remove it from the heat and stir about 1 cup of the milk into the plain yogurt until thoroughly blended. Stir this mixture back into the pan of milk.\nPour the milk mixture into warm glass jars to within 1/2 inch of the rims. Set in the warm water bath. The water level should be up to the level of the yogurt in the jars. Cook uncovered and be sure to maintain the temperature at 110 to 115 degrees F (45 degrees C) for 4 to 6 hours. I like to do 6. Do not stir or poke the yogurt at all during this time - even if you are tempted! Doing this may cause it to become watery.\nWhen the time is about up, you can check the yogurt by pressing gently on the top or tipping the jars to see if it is set. It is done when the yogurt is firm and there is a thin layer of yellowish liquid on the top. Remove the jars from the water and dry off. Seal with clean lids and rings. They should be good to keep in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 weeks.\nBe sure to save a little extra out as a starter for the next batch. Over time your homemade yogurt will start to lose it's potency as starter (like making a copy of a copy of a copy), so every fourth or fifth batch you may want to use store-bought yogurt as starter. Just make sure it says ''live active cultures'' on the container. Good luck!\n",

Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Whisk together the flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Press each chicken breast into the flour mixture on both sides. Tap off excess flour.\nHeat olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat until the butter gives off a slightly toasted fragrance, and pan-fry the chicken until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Set aside. Melt 1 more tablespoon of butter in the skillet, and cook and stir the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes; stir in the shiitake mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, cremini mushrooms, and garlic, and cook until the mushrooms have given off their juice and begun to brown, 10 to 12 minutes.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fettuccini, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Place the pasta into a serving dish, and toss with 2 tablespoons of butter; season to taste with salt and black pepper, and keep warm.\nAfter the mushroom juices have evaporated, pour Marsala wine into the sauce, and scrape up and dissolve any browned flavor bits in the bottom of the skillet. Turn heat to high, and stir until half the wine evaporates, about 3 minutes; stir in mascarpone, Dijon mustard, and chicken broth; cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened slightly, another 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; return cooked chicken breasts to the sauce. Cook until the chicken juices run clear and the sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in parsley. Serve with buttered fettuccine.\n",
