Add the melted mixture from the saucepan and egg.\nMix everything together and knead it into a ball. Chill the dough in a plastic bag for 30 minutes.\nSprinkle some flour on a flat, clean surface and on a rolling pin. Then roll the dough out until it is about 1/4 inch thick. Use cookie cutters or a knife to cut out shapes and people. Lift the cookies onto baking sheet, then gather all the leftover dough and cut out more shapes. Press currants into the dough to make eyes and buttons and bake for 10 to 15 minutes until they are golden brown.\nTo Make Icing: Sift the confectioners' sugar into a bowl. Add a little water at a time to make a thick, smooth paste. Spoon a bit of the icing into a small bowl and add a few drops of food coloring. Do the same with the rest, using a different color. Fill pastry bags with the icing and squeeze it onto the cookies to make clothes!\n",
