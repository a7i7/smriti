Cover, and let rise until doubled in size.\nDrain poppy seeds well, and put through the finest blade of a grinder 3 times. Cream butter or margarine and honey. Add cream, and stir in poppy seeds, nuts, raisins and grated peel. Add more cream if necessary to spread thinly over dough.\nDeflate dough, and divide in half. Roll each half to a 12 x 8 inch rectangle. Spread with poppy seed filling. Roll up, jelly-roll fashion, from long edge. Slice each into 12 pieces, and place cut side down in greased 9 inch round cake pans. Let rise until doubled in bulk.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 18 to 20 minutes.\n",

Lightly grease a large baking sheet with shortening and then dust lightly with flour. Use a 10 inch pan as a template and draw a 10 inch circle onto the flour dusted sheet using a toothpick. Set aside.\nPlace the 4 eggs into a small measuring cup and mix with a fork to combine, set aside.\nCombine the milk, water, salt and butter in a saucepan over medium heat. When it comes to a full boil, add the flour all at once and stir to make a paste. Continue to stir over the heat for about 40 seconds until the paste dries a little. Remove from heat and place paste into a mixing bowl. Let cool about 4 minutes.\nWith a mixer on low, mix the paste and slowly add the beaten eggs. Mix slowly but thoroughly until all of the eggs have been added. Place the paste into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2 inch round decorating tip. Pipe the paste out onto the sheet pan following the 10 inch ring you outlined. Pipe a second ring around the inside next to this ring. Finally, pipe another ring on top of these two rings. Lightly paint the set of rings with the remaining 1 beaten egg and press the sliced almonds into the paste.\nPlace in the oven on the lowest shelf and bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake about 12 minutes more or until brown. Remove form the oven and using a long serrated knife slice off the top half of the puffed ring. Remove any bits of raw dough on the inside of the ring. Replace the top and place back in the oven to crisp the dough, about 5 more minutes. Cool on a rack.\nTo Make The Filling: Whip the pastry cream until smooth. Place the heavy cream into a bowl along with the vanilla and beat on high until soft peaks are formed. Add in the confectioners' sugar and beat a little more. Fold the pastry cream in with the whipped cream and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe the cream mixture into the ring and then replace the top. If you wish, sprinkle with additional powdered sugar.\n",

Cool crackers on the sheets for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Reduce oven heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan with parchment paper, then butter the paper and the sides of the pan.\nPlace the toasted pecans, baked crackers, and 1 tablespoon melted butter in a food processor. Pulse until crumbled. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the prepared pan. Chill in the refrigerator while preparing the filling.\nBeat three 8-ounce packages of cream cheese, 8 ounces of blue cheese, and 6 ounces of Parmesan cheese with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the mixture before adding the next. Beat in the heavy cream and 1 teaspoon pepper with the last egg. Pour the mixture into prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven for about 1 1/2 hours. The cheesecake is ready when the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken. Run the tip of a paring knife around the edges of the pan, set the pan on a wire rack, and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature for 1 hour before placing into the refrigerator, and cooling 4 hours to overnight.\nHeat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more. Add in the chopped pears, dried cherries, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook and stir until pears are tender. Remove the onion and fruit from the skillet using a slotted spoon. Drain the juice back into the skillet, then mash the fruit in a bowl with a fork. Simmer the juice in the skillet over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Transfer glaze to a separate bowl.\nBeat the remaining 8-ounce package of cream cheese, 4 ounces of blue cheese, 2 ounces of Parmesan cheese, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Spread the cheese mixture over the cooled cheesecake. Sprinkle with candied pecans. Serve with cherry pear compote, sliced pear, and vinegar glaze on the side.\n",
