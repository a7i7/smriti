Then, while whisking mixture vigorously, slowly pour the warmed egg mixture back into the sauce.\nPlace the saucepan back over low heat, gently stirring the sauce and raising the temperature slowly to medium. Continue to stir until the sauce almost reaches a simmer, reducing the heat as necessary if the mixture threatens to boil. Continue stirring until the sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes.
