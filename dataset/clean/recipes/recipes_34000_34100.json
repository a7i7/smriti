You can use any container that is big enough to hold the milk, but if it is too big, it will be more difficult to form the tofu.\nMeasure the nigari into the container at the table first. Pour the hot soy milk into the container. No stirring is necessary as the act of pouring the liquid in stirs it enough to form the tofu. Wait for 3 to 5 minutes for the tofu to form.
