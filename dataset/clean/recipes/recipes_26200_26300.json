Let the cakes cool in the pans for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack to finish cooling.\nTo make frosting, place the cream cheese into the work bowl of an electric mixer and beat on Low speed until the cream cheese is softened, about 30 seconds. Beat in the confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract, and beat on Medium speed until the frosting is thick and fluffy, about 2 minutes.\nSpread the cream cheese frosting over the top of one of cooled cake rounds, place the second cake round on top of the frosted round and spread the remaining frosting evenly over the layered cake. Press the toasted coconut gently into the top and sides of the cake.\n",

Gradually add water while mixing and squeezing with your hand until the dough holds together without being sticky or dry, and molds easily with the hand.
