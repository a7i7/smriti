Mix until fully incorporated.\nIn a separate bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until medium peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the egg whites should curl over slightly.\nUsing a large whisk or rubber spatula, gently fold 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the batter to lighten. Fold in remaining egg whites and blend in chopped pecans. Pour about 1 cup of the batter into the prepared cake mold. Put a toothpick into each ear and nose to help the cake hold together while baking. Pour remaining batter into mold.\nBake in a preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
