Store finished ravioli in freezer after you make them, to prevent bottoms from becoming soggy.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and add the ravioli, a few at a time, stirring to prevent sticking. Gently boil the ravioli until they float to the top and become tender, 3 to 5 minutes; remove to a serving dish with a slotted spoon and keep warm.\nWhile ravioli are cooking, melt butter and bacon drippings together in a saucepan over medium heat, and whisk in cream cheese until smooth.
