This will help the cookies keep their shape after pressing.\nLightly grease cookie sheets, and fill cookie press with dough. Press out cookies at least 1 inch apart depending on the size. You can experiment with different cookie designs. I've found most true Swedes tend to use the star shape, however, you're free to use whatever shape suits your fancy.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned.
