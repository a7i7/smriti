Continue whisking until cream mixture is thick and smooth, about 5 more minutes; do not let boil or custard will curdle. Remove custard from heat and let stand until it reaches room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nDrain juice from strawberries and layer them into the bottom of the baked pie shell. Spread cream custard over the berries; refrigerate until set, about 4 hours.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nSprinkle 1/4 cup white sugar evenly over top of pie and broil until the sugar is browned, about 5 minutes.
