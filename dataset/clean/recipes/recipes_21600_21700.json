Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the salsa moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree until no large chunks remain. Return to the skillet, and simmer over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes until the salsa thickens slightly. Pour into a bowl, and cool to room temperature.\nOnce cool, stir in the salt, cilantro, red onion, and lime juice to serve.\n",
