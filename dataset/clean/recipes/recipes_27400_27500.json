Gently scoop the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the top springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.\nTo make the simple syrup, bring 1/2 cup water and 3/4 cup sugar to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.\nTo make the Italian meringue, combine 1/4 cup water with the 7/8 cup of sugar in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar (don't stir once the mixture begins to boil). Use a candy thermometer and bring the sugar to the soft ball stage (240 degrees F/115 degrees C). While the sugar is boiling, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until soft peaks form.\nWhen the boiling sugar syrup has nearly reached soft ball stage, increase the mixing speed for the egg whites to high. Carefully pour the hot sugar syrup into the egg whites between the beaters and the side of the bowl. Continue beating on high speed until the meringue has cooled to room temperature.\nMelt the bittersweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, just until melted. Remove from heat and allow to cool until the chocolate is room temperature but still fluid.\nWhip the 1 3/4 cups cream until medium-stiff peaks form.\nUse a rubber spatula to fold the melted chocolate into the egg white meringue. Add 1/3 cup of room-temperature cream and mix gently until blended. Fold 1/3 of the whipped cream into the chocolate meringue mixture to lighten it; then gently fold in the remaining 2/3 of the whipped cream.\nTo assemble the cake, split the sponge cake into two layers. Set one cake layer on a turntable or plate. Brush the cake well with the simple syrup. The cake will literally act as a sponge and absorb the syrup, which will keep it from being dry. Spread 1/3 of the chocolate cream on the cake, and top it with the second cake layer. Repeat with the syrup and the cream. Spread the remaining chocolate cream on the sides of the cake.

It will also change the texture of the filling - you will not have pockets of melted chocolate in the wontons.\nTo make the wontons: Separate and place the wonton wrappers onto your work surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the banana filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal.

Remove, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve warm with the caramel sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons chocolate chips to garnish.\n",
