Return the mixture to the saucepan and bring the custard to a simmer over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or spatula.\nCook and stir the custard until it thickens, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, stirring occasionally to keep it smooth. Combine the three remaining egg yolks with the vanilla, liqueur, and the sugar-cocoa-cornstarch mixture. Whisk in the warm custard, cover, and set aside. (The custard can be made ahead of time up to this point and refrigerated for a day before proceeding with the recipe.)\nAbout 35 minutes before serving, whip the egg whites until they are thick and foamy and have quadrupled in volume. Gradually mix in the remaining 3 tablespoons of the sugar, whipping until the egg whites are stiff but not dry. Fold 1/3 of the meringue into the custard to lighten it, using a whisk or rubber spatula. Fold in the remaining meringue.\nImmediately transfer the souffle batter into the prepared ramekins, making a smooth mound slightly above the rim of each ramekin.

(The 7th cookie sets on top of the stack; there is no sour cream filling on top of it.) Sift confectioner's sugar on the top cookie. Refrigerate for at least 5 hours or longer so the whole thing can meld & mellow together into a \"cake-like\" torte. Cut into wedges and stand back while everyone goes NUTS!\n",
