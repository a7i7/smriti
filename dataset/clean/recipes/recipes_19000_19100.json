Use a slotted spoon to transfer the mushrooms to a small bowl, reserving the consomme. Mix the pate with the mushrooms, adding a little consomme if needed to achieve a spreadable texture. Divide the mushrooms among the filets and spread on the top. Refrigerate about 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lay the puff pastry out on a clean surface and cut out two 5 to 6 inch rounds for each steak. You can roll it out a little thinner if you need more area.

For best results use a meat thermometer to determine the temperature of the steaks, with 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) being medium doneness. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for about 5 minutes.\nWhile the steaks are cooking, make the sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until browned. Stir in the green onions, and cook until tender, about 1 minute. Gradually stir in the reserved consomme and the remaining 1 cup of consomme; continue to cook and stir until the sauce thickens. Reduce heat to low and stir in the wine. Continue to simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in butter and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nTo serve, cut each Wellington in half and spoon some sauce onto the plate.\n",
