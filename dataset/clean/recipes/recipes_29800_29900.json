Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the flour has turned golden, and begins to smell like toasted bread, about 20 minutes. Whisk in 2 cups chicken broth and simmer until thickened and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Pour the sauce into the rice pilaf, reserving about 1/4 of it for serving, if desired.\nHeat another 1/4 cup of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the mushrooms and cook until soft, about 5 minutes; add the 1 1/2 cups onion. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 8 minutes. Combine the onions and mushrooms with the rice mixture and allow it to cool slightly. Stir in the lemon juice, chopped hard-cooked eggs, and fresh dill.\nPreheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with buttered parchment paper.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the cabbage leaves and cook, uncovered, until softened, about 2 minutes. Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Once the leaves are cold, drain well, and blot dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a 1/4-inch thickness. Cut the pastry into 6 rectangular shapes; they should be three times wider than the salmon fillets, and 2 inches longer. Lay 2 cabbage leaves on each rectangle and top each with a spoonful of the rice mixture. Place each fillet \"skin-side\" up on top of the rice, and season with salt and black pepper. Top the fillets with another spoonful of rice; fold the cabbage leaves over the fillets to encase them. Center the folded leaves on the puff pastry.\nFold the short ends of the pastry in, and then the sides together to make a packet; pinch along the seams to seal. Place the pastries onto the parchment-lined baking sheet seam sides down. Cut a small slit in the center of each pastry to act as a steam vent. Beat the egg and 1 tablespoon water together in a bowl; brush the pastries with the egg wash.\nBake in the preheated oven until the pastries are deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. The internal temperature of the salmon should reach 135 degrees F (57 degrees C).\n",

        "instructions": "In a bowl, thoroughly mix together the ground venison, pork sausage, 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce, salt, and black pepper. Divide the mixture into fourths, and form each fourth into a large patty. Refrigerate until time to grill.\nIf using onion rings, preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread frozen rings in a single layer on a baking sheet, and bake until hot and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set the onion rings aside.\nIn a large skillet, heat butter and olive oil; cook the onions until they begin to brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix in the sliced mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 10 to 15 more minutes. Set the onions and mushrooms aside.\nPlace the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nHeat 1 tablespoon of butter in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat until the foam disappears. Crack the eggs into a bowl, and gently pour them into the butter. Pan-fry the eggs until the whites are opaque and the eggs slide around the pan easily, about 1 minute; carefully flip each egg over in the skillet, avoiding breaking the yolk, and pan-fry for about 1 more minute. The whites should be firm but the yolks should be runny. Transfer the eggs to a plate.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Grill the venison burgers until they show grill marks and are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 5 to 8 minutes per side for well-done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). While still on the grill, gently top each burger with a fried egg and a slice of cheese. Lower the grill lid, and cook until the cheese has melted, about 1 minute.\nTo assemble, place the bottom half of a Kaiser roll onto a plate; spread with a layer of shredded lettuce, followed by tomato slices, the venison burger, a layer of mushrooms and onions, bacon slices, onion rings, avocado slices, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. Place the roll top onto the sandwich. Good luck.\n",

Whisk together the butter, 2 eggs, salt, 2 teaspoons sugar, and yeast mixture until the sugar has dissolved. Stir in flour to form a smooth dough. Cover with a cloth and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk together 1 cup of milk with the cornstarch in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until very hot and steaming, but not quite simmering. Whisk 2 eggs together with 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl until well beaten. Slowly whisk in half of the hot milk mixture, adding it about 2 tablespoons at a time until incorporated. Stir the egg mixture into the saucepan of milk, and cook gently until thickens and begins to bubble. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Set the filling aside to cool.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C), and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nPunch down the dough, and divide it into two pieces. Roll each piece into a 12x12 inch square, and cut each square into 9 equal pieces about 4 inches on a side. Place about 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of each piece, and fold a corner across over the filling. Fold the opposite corner across and seal the corners over the filling. Fold the two remaining corners across the filling and seal to make a tidy packet enclosing the filling.\nPlace the filled buns, folded sides down, on the prepared baking sheets, and brush each bun with beaten egg. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, until the buns are golden brown, and let cool.\nStir together the confectioners' sugar, hot water, and cocoa powder in a bowl, and spread the icing onto each bun. Refrigerate leftover buns.\n",

Stuff the casing with the sausage mixture, twisting the filled casing every 2 1/2 to 4 inches to form links. Once all of the sausage mixture has been used, tie the end of the last link.\nUsing fine cotton kitchen twine, tie the ends of each sausage link tightly, then cut between each link to separate. Place into a glass or plastic container, cover, and allow to mature in the refrigerator for 4 days, after which point they may be frozen.\nTo cook the longanisa, fill a skillet with 1/2 to 3/4 inches of water and add thawed sausages. Simmer over medium-high heat until the water evaporates, about 20 minutes. Uncover, and allow the sausages to fry in their own oil until golden brown, about 8 minutes more.\n",
