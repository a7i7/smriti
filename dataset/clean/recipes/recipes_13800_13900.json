Fold one edge of the wrapper over to the other. Fold the outer edges in slightly, then continue to roll into a cylinder. Wet your finger, and moisten the edge to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling, keeping finished lumpias covered to prevent drying.

In the Philippines, lumpia was eaten with banana ketchup, but I've never seen it sold in America.\n",
