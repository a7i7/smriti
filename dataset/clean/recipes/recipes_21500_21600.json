Place the fish in a shallow baking dish or roasting pan. Cover each side with fresh ginger, then green onions and tomatoes. Season with sea salt. Slice half of the lime and place the slices on top of the fish. Drizzle with the soy sauce, and squeeze the other half of the lime over the fish. Cut the lemon in half and set in the pan. Cover the whole dish with aluminum foil.\nBake the fish until the flesh is opaque and can be flaked with a fork, about 20 minutes. Squeeze the baked lemon halves over the fish before serving. Serve the fillet on the top side first, then gently lift out the backbone, while helping the flesh off the bones with your knife. It's much easier than trying to turn the fish over.\n",

Toss the shrimp in a bowl with olive oil and salt and pepper to taste.\nCook shrimp on the preheated grill until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 3 minutes on each side.\nTo assemble sandwiches: Spread prepared mayonnaise dressing generously on 1 slice of bread. Arrange half of the shrimp and avocado slices on top. Place another slice of bread over the avocado, and spread another layer of the dressing. Top with a lettuce leaf and 2 slices of tomato followed by a third slice of bread. Repeat with the remaining ingredients for the second sandwich.\n",

        "instructions": "Peel back the skin from the chicken drumsticks and breasts without removing the skin, and make several deep cuts in the chicken meat. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning into the cuts and onto the meat, then replace the skin. Whisk 1/2 cup olive oil and white wine together in a bowl. Place the chicken into a large bowl, pour the olive oil mixture over, stir to coat, and refrigerate 1 hour.\nRemove the chicken pieces from the marinade, and discard the marinade. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet until the oil shimmers, and brown the chicken pieces over medium heat, working in batches if necessary, about 5 minutes per side. Place all the chicken pieces into a large soup pot, and pour the broth over the chicken. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the chicken until tender, about 20 minutes.\nWhile the chicken is simmering, place the onion, green bell pepper, and celery into a skillet with 3 tablespoons of olive oil, and cook and stir until the onions are transparent and the peppers have softened, about 8 minutes. Set the onion mixture aside.\nMake a roux: mix flour and canola oil together in a nonstick pan, stirring the mixture together until smooth and lump-free. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent burning. After about 5 minutes of stirring, the roux will begin to turn a pale golden color, and gently bubble and foam. Stir the roux until it turns the color of milk chocolate and gives off a nutty fragrance, about 30 to 40 more minutes. Watch carefully because it's easy to burn the roux. Pull the pan from the hot burner, and stir until the roux cools and stops cooking, about 5 more minutes.\nStir the onion mixture and 1 cup of boiling water into the roux (be careful to avoid spattering), heat over medium heat until the mixture comes to a simmer, and whisk until the roux and water combine and become thick, about 10 minutes. Pour the thickened roux into the pot with the chicken, stir together, and add 9 more cups of boiling water. Season the gumbo with 2 more teaspoons of Cajun seasoning, or to taste, and bring the soup to a rolling boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour.\nSprinkle garlic powder and cayenne pepper over the smoked sausage, and brown in a skillet with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Transfer the sausage into the soup, and simmer for 30 more minutes. Remove the chicken pieces, and take the chicken meat off the bones, discarding the skin and bones. Return the chicken meat to the soup. Simmer 15 more minutes, and skim off the layer of oil that has formed on top of the gumbo.\nWhile the gumbo is simmering, bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.\nServe gumbo over hot, cooked rice with a generous sprinkling of chopped green onions over each serving.\n",
