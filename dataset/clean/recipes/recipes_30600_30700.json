Keep stirring over medium heat until caramel melts and mixture comes up to temperature and sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat\nStir in kosher salt, vanilla, and cold milk; mix well.\nPlace egg yolks in a large mixing bowl. Whisk in a ladleful of caramel/milk mixture to the yolks. Add 2 more ladlefuls, one at a time. Then mix in the remainder of the caramel/milk mixture to the yolks, whisking until thoroughly blended.\nDivide custard mixture evenly among the ramekins. Carefully pour into the baking dish enough water so that it comes halfway up the sides of the filled ramekins.\nBake in preheated oven until custard is set and the top of custard jiggles evenly across the surface, 45 to 60 minutes (depending on the size of your ramekins and how full they are). If the center seems looser than the edges, continue to bake another minute or so.\nTransfer ramekins to a cooling rack; cool to room temperature. Cover ramekins with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour until they are very cold.\nServe topped with a pinch of light, flaky sea salt.\n",

Brush cold water along a 1 inch border on each edge of the rectangle, and set strips on top to frame the edges. Beat 1 egg, and brush onto surface of pastry. Chill until firm, about 15 minutes; this is an important step.\nHeat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Bake shell in preheated oven until it is starting to brown, around 10 minutes. Remove pastry from oven, and reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press base firmly with back of a fork to collapse it. Return to oven, and bake until golden, around 8 minutes. Transfer to rack to cool. This can be made up to 2 days in advance; store at room temperature in an airtight container.\nTo Make White Chocolate Custard: Heat milk on medium heat in heavy saucepan, stirring, until it comes to a boil. Remove from heat. Add vanilla bean to milk, cover, and steep for 10 minutes. Remove vanilla bean. Meanwhile, whip yolks with sugar until thick and light colored. Whisk in flour. Gradually stir hot milk into the yolk mixture, stirring until smooth. Pour into the sauce pan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens. Lower the heat. Continue cooking the pastry cream, whisking constantly, until it softens slightly; this should take about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and fold in white chocolate. Transfer pastry cream to small bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Unwrap when cool, and add creme de cacao. This can be made 1 day in advance; cover and refrigerate until needed.\nThe Chambord sauce can be made up to 2 days in advance. Puree the defrosted raspberries in a blender. Strain to remove the seeds, and stir in 3 tablespoons Chambord liqueur. Keep refrigerated.\nWhen you are ready to assemble the tart, make the glaze. In a saucepan, melt preserves over low heat. Remove from heat, and stir in 1 tablespoon liqueur. Use while warm.\nThis tart is best if consumed within 3 to 4 hours of final assembly. Brush bottom of tart with glaze, and sprinkle with half of the chopped almonds. Spoon custard into pastry shell, and smooth. Arrange fresh berries over top of custard, and brush with glaze. Sprinkle remaining almonds on top. Chill until ready to serve.\n",
