Pour in the melted gelatin and the cooled coffee and mix well.\nIn a bowl, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form, gradually beating in 1/4 cup of brown sugar (see Notes).\nUse a rubber spatula or wire whisk to fold 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the cheese mixture. Gently run the spatula through the center of the bowl, then around the sides of the bowl, repeating until fully incorporated. Add the remaining egg white mixture, folding just until incorporated. Transfer the filling to the cake pan, spreading it gently over the cookie crust to smooth the surface. Chill until set, preferably overnight.\nCombine the milk chocolate, milk, and 2 teaspoons of butter in a small saucepan. Melt the chocolate over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool; it should be fluid but not set. Pour the glaze over the cheesecake, spreading it to evenly coat the surface. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of cream in droplets over the glaze; swirl a toothpick through the glaze and cream to get a marbled effect. Chill until set, about 1 hour.\nCarefully remove the outer ring of the springform pan and transfer the cheesecake onto a serving platter.\n",

Using your fingertips, quickly press the butter into the flour mixture until it holds together. Shape the dough into a disc and place it between two large pieces of waxed paper. Set it aside at room temperature for 1 hour.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nUsing a rolling pin, roll the dough out between the waxed paper to a 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out the cookies using a star-shape cookie cutter, a fluted or plain 2 1/2-inch round cutter, or a juice glass.\nCarefully transfer the cookies to a baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch between the cookies. (If the dough is too soft and it is difficult to transfer the cookies, slide the waxed paper with the cutout cookies onto a baking sheet and freeze or refrigerate for 5 to 10 minutes.) Gather together any scraps of dough and repeat the process.\nBake for 8 minutes or until the cookies are lightly browned on the edges.\nTransfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool for 2 to 4 minutes. Using a metal spatula, lift the cookies to a wire rack and cool completely. When cool, store the cookies in an airtight container. These cookies freeze well.\n",
