Set aside.\nPlace the pork ribs in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large stock pot. In the same skillet, cook the sausage until browned. Add to stock pot.\nFill the skillet with a mix of olive oil and vegetable oil to a level about 1 to 2 inches up the side of the pan. Heat over medium-high heat and place meatballs into the oil. Do not attempt to turn the meatballs until they release from the bottom of the pan. You want a nice crusty meatball. Once meatballs are done, add them to the stockpot, too. Pour 4 quarts of tomato puree into the stockpot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and allow to simmer.\nDrain most of the oil out of the skillet, but leaving enough to fry the onion. Heat the oil over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more. Stir in the can of tomato paste along with 3/4 cup of water, and the final quart of tomato puree into the skillet. Let simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, then pour the sauce into stockpot. Simmer until the meats are tender, 1 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally.\n",
