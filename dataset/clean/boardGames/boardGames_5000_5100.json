The game begins with tiles placed face down to build the territory.  Players explore the territory while fighting enemy troops with knights, soldiers, a Pegasus, and captured dragons.  War is only one strategy to play -- players can also try to take the princess to the enemy castle and force her marriage to the local prince.&#10;&#10;For Draco Mundis&#10;The players have the responsibility of a team of various adventurers trying to gain victory points by exploring the jungle. All players start with exactly the same team.&#10;&#10;First they must lay down their pawns (characters, terrains) and then, in turn, realize two actions, like move, fight, or explore.&#10;&#10;In order to gain victory points, they can kill their opponents or manage to place some of their characters in strategic points on the map.&#10;&#10;Each pawn has its own constraints, e.g. all cannot move in every direction, or have the same movement points and fight points. Some have special abilities.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The game tries to recreate the Midgard role playing feeling in a boardgame. It addresses former Midgard RPG players, who don't find the time for role playing anymore, as well as fans of fantasy boardgames. As the complexity level is rather high and the game offers multiple options for players, Midgard is rather successful in achieving it's goal. The difficulty is still light to medium, despite dozens of cards that influence the game and the characters.&#10;&#10;The game is based on tiles (major cities of Midgard) players move across, collecting rare items and fulfilling adventures. Often this ends in the local city jail or in clashes with monsters. Additional threats like terror cards or riots pop up in cities during the game.&#10;&#10;Tests are made with a 20-sided die and the mechanics are just the same as in the Midgard RPG. Movement and actions are controlled by action cards from a four-card-hand which allows tactical gaming. Each action card has different abilities and some may even interrupt another player's turn.&#10;&#10;Players may form groups for the duration of a game turn to help each other solve adventures or make difficult tests. Sticking together earns each player of a group experience points and treasure cards. As only one player can finally win the game, forming groups is a two-edged sword as it helps your opponents too. The goal of the game is to get 3 treasure rewards, rise to character level 3 and find 2 artifacts first. If you deliver the treasures and artifacts to the correct city you have won the game.&#10;&#10;Included are pre-generated characters like Sorcerer or Warrior but players will be able to create their own characters in the final release version.&#10;&#10;This information is derived from the website of Phantastische-Spielewelten.&#10;&#10;http://www.phantastische-spielewelten.de&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.&#10;&#10;The  opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.&#10;&#10;From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.&#10;&#10;To the Barricades!, the first title in the War Storms series, is a game which attempts to simulate, at platoon and company level, the battles which took place on the different fronts of the war. The rules are oriented towards the tactical simulation of combat involving armored vehicles, infantry, artillery, and aircraft, and as such they are especially suited to represent almost any 20th century armed conflict as it actually happened.&#10;&#10;",

Each player directs the effort of one or more of the major powers, plus their minor allies, using the card-driven operations and point-to-point movement system of many of GMT&rsquo;s most highly-regarded games.  The cards help players enact Frederick&rsquo;s pre-war invasion planning, Austrian minister Kaunitz&rsquo;s diplomatic triumph in the 2nd Treaty of Versailles, the operational ascendancy of Prussian and Hanoverian light troops, formation of the Austrian General Staff, huge financial loans, court intrigue at Versailles, Vienna, and St. Petersburg, and dozens of other key political, economic, and military events.

Beginning with Chandragupta Maurya&rsquo;s victories over the Nanda clan, the game follows the brief but rapid rise of the Mauryan dynasty, from Chandragupta&rsquo;s expulsion of Seleucus from the Indus river valley to the conquest of the last independent kingdom on the subcontinent, Kalinga, by his grandson Ashoka.  The Mauryan empire became the largest and most powerful in India&rsquo;s history &ndash; a distinction that would remain unchallenged until the arrival of the Mughals some 1,700 years later.&#10;&#10;Chandragupta simulates the traditional &ldquo;four-fold&rdquo; division of the Indian military system, with the elephant corps reigning supreme, and the hordes of light infantry regarded as little more than fodder for chariots&rsquo; wheels and trampling pachyderms.  Chariots still play a prominent role on the Indian battlefield of the era, but the cavalry, with its versatility and endurance, is a potent competitor.  In Chandragupta, victory goes to the commander who can master the unique aspects of the differing Indian military &ldquo;classes&rdquo; &ndash; the professional, lifelong soldiers called Maulas, the mercenary levies, unpredictable tribal allies, and the militias of the powerful trade guilds.  While Maulas and mercenaries are commanded under a single hierarchical command structure, the tribals and the trade guilds are led by independent chiefs.&#10;&#10;Units include cataphracted elephants, &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; four- (and sometimes eight-!) wheeled chariots, and even an &ldquo;elCH&rdquo; unit &ndash; yes, elephant-pulled chariots.  Rules include Combined Chariot/Infantry and Elephant/Infantry lines, Dharmayudda or &ldquo;just&rdquo; warfare, Guild enmity, and Tribal loyalty.  EL units can even breach camp walls and pull down city gates (if they don&rsquo;t rampage first).&#10;&#10;Fans of GBoH will appreciate the exciting variety in Chandragupta&rsquo;s scenarios, from huge set-piece battles on flat plains, to tribal suppressions, a night assault on a military camp, and street fighting in the city of Takshashila.  Chandragupta is the 13th volume in the series.&#10;&#10;Battles:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pataliputra (319 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s mentor, the Brahmin Chanakya, brashly challenges the Nanda dynasty with a cadre of mercenaries.&#10;     Maghada (317 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta again confronts the Nandas, who are this time led by the formidable general Bhadrasala.&#10;     Mayalaketu (317 BC) &ndash; Chanakya attacks the turncoat general Mayalaketu and his rebel army in camp.&#10;     Takshashila (316 BC) &ndash; the Thracian general Eudamus, allied to Indian king Ambhi, defends the city of Takshashila against Chandragupta&rsquo;s assault.&#10;     Gandhara (304 BC) &ndash; former officer of Alexander the Great, now &ldquo;Master of Babylonia,&rdquo; Seleucus I Nicator crosses the Indus river to invade Gandhara, and is confronted by the Mauryan army at the river&rsquo;s banks.&#10;     Revolt in the Provinces (275 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s grandson, Ashoka, brings a relief force to lift a rebel siege of Takshashila and rescue the aging Chanakya who is holed up in the city&rsquo;s palace.&#10;     Khashas (274 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s son, Bhindusara, puts down a confederation of the independent Khasha kings with an attack on their mountain strongholds.&#10;     Kalinga (261 BC) &ndash; the most famous battle of the Mauryan era, Ashoka&rsquo;s army attacks the kingdom of Kalinga in a huge &ndash; and bloody -- set-piece battle.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "PQ-17 is a 2-player game of World War II air-naval operations in the Barents and Norwegian Seas, where the Allied player strives to pass convoys to and from north Russia in the face of appalling weather and determined opposition from his Axis opponent. PQ-17 highlights the impact of reconnaissance, fuel, and the extreme climate without the drawbacks of a double-blind system or tedious bookkeeping.&#10;&#10;Each of the 1&quot; square ship counters in the game depicts an individual capital ship or cruiser or a group of smaller ships, submarines, or merchant vessels. Virtually every vessel that sailed arctic waters in 1942 is included, along with others that fought (or might have) in key actions. Counters are formatted much like the units in traditional block wargames, allowing step reduction to show damage or reduced numbers without cumbersome markers or rosters. These large counters never appear on the map, however; they remain off-map on players' Task Force Displays until battle is joined.&#10;&#10;Instead, players maneuver blocks on a mapboard stretching from Greenland and Ireland to Kiel and the Kara Sea. Each block is a force of submarines or surface ships, its identity hidden from the enemy player until it is located by a successful search and the block is turned up. It may represent one ship or one hundred - or none at all, as it may be a dummy. Reconnaissance is critical, as you must locate the enemy in order to attack him. Cards are used to resolve searches quickly and efficiently: a successful search yields intelligence of varying accuracy, while failure to relocate the enemy in a timely manner results in lost contact and generation of another dummy.&#10;&#10;Players must also cope with fuel restrictions, reflecting limited endurance (particularly for destroyers) and Axis shortages. Simple rules and the use of markers on the Task Force Displays preclude the need for record keeping while preventing unrealistic freedom of action.&#10;&#10;To show the key role of air power in the campaign, PQ-17 also includes over 100 air units. Circular counters represent RAF Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm squadrons and Luftwaffe Staffeln and Gruppen that participated in naval operations in the theater, as well as selected air defense units. Many VVS air regiments are also included, along with the USAAF squadrons that defended Iceland.&#10;&#10;Because the focus of the game is operational, battles are fought on an abstract Combat Display. Simple procedures and multiple Combat Results Tables reproduce historical levels of damage from all forms of combat: submarine attacks, antisubmarine warfare, bombing and aerial torpedo attacks, anti-aircraft fire, air-to-air combat, and naval surface actions.&#10;&#10;PQ-17's environmental model is based upon historical meteorological and oceanographic records to accurately reflect the extreme conditions and their effects. Summer operations, conducted in round-the-clock daylight, play much differently than those undertaken in the near-total darkness of winter. The polar ice pack advances and ebbs with the seasons, varying the sea routes available and posing a hazard for naval forces venturing too close. And besides each other, players must also battle some of the worst weather in the world, potentially damaging their ships and affecting movement, searches, and combat.&#10;&#10;PQ-17 features nine historical scenarios, including all the major actions of the campaign: the Fleet Air Arm torpedo attack on Tirpitz, the decimation of convoy PQ-17, the climactic battle of PQ-18, the Battle of the Barents Sea, and the 1943 Battle of North Cape. To add uncertainty, each side is subject to a special condition in every operation, which may impose additional requirements or restrictions - or afford additional opportunities - while remaining secret from the opponent. Just like their historical counterparts, Allied players can never be certain that the Germans will not attempt to break out into the Atlantic with one or more heavy ships, and Axis players must beware of a possible attack on Norway; both players may face conflicting priorities and demands that must be met with limited resources. In addition, a 1942 &quot;random&quot; scenario enhances replay value by further disguising starting forces and objectives. Each operational scenario can be played to conclusion in 3-4 hours, and for players seeking a richer experience, a 1942 campaign scenario reflects the challenges of continuing operations over the course of this key year.&#10;&#10;Game Components&#10;&#10;&#10;     One 22x34&quot; map &#10;     58 15mm blocks &#10;     140 1&quot; square counters &#10;     140 1/2&quot; square counters &#10;     136 circular counters in three sizes &#10;     80 cards &#10;     One 24-page Rule Book &#10;     One 20-page Scenario Book &#10;     Two 11x17&quot; + one or two 8.5x11&quot; Play Aids &#10;     Two 8.5x11&quot; Task Force Displays &#10;     One 8.5x11&quot; Battle Display &#10;     Five 10-sided Dice &#10;&#10;&#10;Old Home Page at Publisher: http://www.gmtgames.com/pq17/main.html&#10;New Home Page at Publisher: http://www.gmtgames.com/p-126-pq-17.aspx&#10;&#10;",

Then coins (VP) are collected by each street seller depending on proximity to the dragon, the top payoff of 5 going only to the pawn on the exact same space.&#10;&#10;You play as many hands as there are players, with each player going first once.

The Emperor Claudius had dispatched Aulus Plautius and 45,000 men to conquer the mist-covered island where Julius Caesar had failed almost a century earlier.&#10; Over the next 40 years, Roman would clash with Celt in a series of battles that neither realized would determine the future of Western civilization.  The Romans broke the Britons, whose furious courage could not match Roman discipline. The island would pass under Roman rule for the next several centuries, implanting a Latin-oriented culture and shoving Celtic ways to the very fringes of Europe. All that would remain were their legends; not least among them the fiery leadership of Boudicca, warrior-queen of the Iceni and resolute enemy of Rome.&#10;&#10;The Rome at War series covers Roman battles against both their neighbors and each other. The first game, Rome At War I: Hannibal at Bay, covered the last battles of Carthage&rsquo;s favorite son. The second, Rome at War II: Fading Legions, focused on the empire&rsquo;s latter years, when it was beset by barbarian invasion, an implacable rival, and civil war.&#10;&#10;Rome at War: Queen of the Celts is the third installment in the series. Rome has outstanding heavy infantry, good light cavalry (provided by her allies) and even an elephant. The Britons depend on the fury of their Celtic charge, and also chariots and slingers. Plus they have Druids to help inspire them. &#10; There are nine scenarios, or game situations, included in Queen of the Celts.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The island has fascinated travelers, mystics, and scientists for years as people have wondered how such a small, isolated area could have been home to a society that created the world's most spectacular outdoor museum. In the 1940s, Norwegian archeologist Thor Heyerdahl sailed the reed boat Kon-Tiki from South America to Easter Island to show that the technology available made it possible for Polynesia to be settled from the Americas. In the 1970s, Erich Van Daniken popularized the idea that the world was visited by ancient astronauts and the beautiful and enormous stone statutes, the Moai, of Easter Island were used as some of his &quot;evidence.&quot;&#10;&#10;Today, scientists around the world generally agree that Easter Island was settled from other Polynesian islands to its west, and the extreme culture that produced hundreds of stone Moai is related to other cultures in the region. The history of the island is a history of constraint, and the carving of the Moai, the rapid deforestation of the island, and the limited food sources available all worked together to build an extreme culture that became the victim of its own consumption. In this way, Easter Island today represents more than just a wonderful place to travel, but also is a reminder of the greater resource limits of our entire planet. As populations continue to grow and we put further strains on sources of fuel and food, are we heading toward the same fate that this small island suffered hundreds of years ago? The island today is owned by Chile, and the small population thrives with a few weekly flights to mainland South America and the occasional cargo ship visit.&#10;&#10;Moai is a game that closely follows the developments and excesses of the island until the arrival of Dutch Admiral Jacob Roggeveen, the first European to discover the island and name it for the day of his discovery. Combining many of the historical features of the island's culture in an exciting and well-playing strategic game, players can have fun reliving the dramatic history of this exciting little island.&#10;&#10;",

During this amazing year, a series of democratic revolutions ended the 40 year Soviet empire in Eastern Europe. 1989 simulates the political, social and economic aspects of these revolutions using a card-driven system similar to Twilight Struggle.&#10;&#10;&quot;No man is so old he cannot live one more year.&quot; - Leszek Kolakowski&#10;&#10;One player plays the Communist. At the start of the game he holds unquestioned power across the six nations of the Warsaw Pact. But there are ominous clouds on the horizon. The new leader in Moscow has declared no more will Soviet tanks prop up tottering Communist governments. The economies, after decades of central planning and stagnation, have reached various stages of crisis. Inside the churches and among the students and their professors there are dissident movements that have been emboldened. From crushing dissent to offering concessions, the Communist player will have to use a variety of strategies in a struggle to hold on to his empire.&#10;&#10;&quot;A bad regime is never in so great danger as when it tries to improve.&quot; - Alexis de Tocqueville&#10;&#10;The other player plays the Democrat. At the dawn of 1989, behind the iron curtain, no one considers revolution possible. The goal of dissidents is to create a civil society outside the control of the Communist regimes. On their side are students who are fascinated with the style and pop culture of the west, and the Church. Against them is the vast apparatus of the Communist state. Their challenge is to persuade the workers, who are the bulk of society, to join their cause.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate.

More than 700 British bombers are dispatched to the distant city of N&#194;&#129;&#194;&#129;&uuml;rnberg. As the bomber stream crawls across the German Reich, it is set upon by swarms of nightfighters. Following the bombers' contrails the figthers infiltrate the stream in great numbers and before the moon can set they pick off bomber after bomber. The mauled stream makes a desultory attack on the target city, scattering much of their payload of high explosive and incendiaries harmlessly into the surrounding countryside. Then the raid struggles bak towards England while fresh formations of nightfighters snap and bite at the retreating formation. More than ninety bombers fail to make it home safely. Soon afterward, the C-in-C of Bomber Command, Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, calls off the Battle of Berlin.&#10;&#10;BOMBER COMMAND is a game of the night war in the skies over the Reich in World War II.&#10;The game recreates the great RAF bombing raids against the heart of Germany and the defence of the German Luftwaffe's night fighter arm.&#10;&#10;Based on an air combat system derived from the award-winning Downtown and The Burning Blue 'raid-scale' games, Bomber Command details the tactics of night fighting.&#10;&#10;The German player must manage flak, Himmelbett zones, Wild Boar and Tame Boar tactics. RAF 'main force' raids are supported by Mosquito diversions, &quot;Gardening&quot; operations (mining of seaways) and decoy raids. Two card decks--one for each player--are used to resolve the complex interactions of electronic countermeasures and radars, along with other operational factors such as Mahmoud patrols, Flower raids, and Beleuchter illumination units. A detailed bombing resolution system depicts the difficulties of marking targets and area bombing at night.&#10;&#10;There are two scenarios:&#10;&#10;1. Berlin covers raiding from the 1943 Hamburg firestorm to the great Battle of Berlin and the RAF's defeat over Nuremburg in March 1944.&#10;&#10;2. Downfall recreates the period from the Summer of 1944 to the collapse of the Luftwaffe in the face of fuel shortages and the RAF's &quot;bomber support&quot; effort.&#10;&#10;The game is fast-playing and raids typically resolve in 2 hours or less.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;    One 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Play Aid Card (2-sided)&#10;    One 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Bombing Card (2-sided)&#10;    One 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Planning Map (2-sided)&#10;    One sheet of 5/8&quot; counters &amp; markers&#10;    One sheet of 1/2&quot; counters &amp; markers&#10;    Four 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; City Map Sheets&#10;    One deck of 55 British cards&#10;    One deck of 55 German cards&#10;    One Rule book&#10;    One Play book&#10;    Two 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Lee Brimmicombe-Wood&#10;MAP &amp; COUNTER ART: Lee Brimmicombe-Wood&#10;AIRCRAFT ART: Ian Wedge&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Dragonball Ball Z CCG was created by Score and had a good number of expansions or sets before finally dying.&#10;&#10;All players start the game with a character from the series, called the main personality. Each main personality character usually has three levels, to a maximum of five. Throughout the game, the main personality can get stronger via gaining anger, replacing the previous version played.&#10;&#10;Decks are divided into seven different styles: Blue, Red, Orange, Black, Saiyan, Namekian and Free-Style. Each style focuses on a different aspect of combat. For instance, the Red style focuses on gaining anger, while the Namekian style focuses on life and energy. If a player uses nothing but one color or style in his or her deck, the player would be able to declare a Tokui-waza at the start of the game, allowing various benefits, such as certain cards allowing additional powers, as stated in the card's text box.&#10;&#10;Later expansions allowed you to play Mastery cards that allowed abilities that always stayed in play. Sensei cards were also eventually introduced, allowing for sideboards to cater against one's opponent.&#10;&#10;There are three ways to win the game. First is to reduce your opponent's deck to zero cards. Second is to win via having the most powerful personality, via gaining anger. This win condition may sometimes be not available, depending on who one's main personality is. Third is to play or capture, all seven Dragon Balls. Again, this win condition may sometimes be unavailable, depending on how decks are constructed.&#10;&#10;The bulk of the Dragon Ball Z CCG focuses on combat. Players alternate as attacker and defender. Attacks are divided into physical and energy attacks. Physical attacks reduce the opponent's power levels, eventually dealing life damage. Energy attacks deal damage directly, but usually costs two power levels to perform. Players must strike a balance between offense and defense, as cards are discarded from one's deck upon taking damage, making it possible for a certain card to be discarded from play, even before being used.&#10;&#10;The game was criticized to be highly random and greatly dependent on having better cards than one's opponent, as opposed to simply being the better player. Nonetheless, the tournament scene was quite popular during the game's existence, and the secondary market remains strong even after the game has died out.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Theme:&#10;&#10;Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world.  Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.&#10;&#10;Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.&#10;&#10;Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.&#10;&#10;In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.&#10;&#10;Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.&#10;&#10;Revised using:&#10;&#10;    Talisman Upgrade Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In a short time their studios became the source of dreams that every American could believe. Initially the actors came from theater, but soon the cinema started to count upon stars more and more famous, liked by the public, able to ensure the success of the movies just with their presence.&#10;&#10;A deduction game for 2 players.&#10;Some actors (and actresses) are dealt to both players, while the rest are kept face down on the table.&#10;You try to guess which actors (and actresses) are in the hand of your opponent (i.e. compose her cast).&#10;To do so, there are several actions available: each player can choose only one per turn and those not chosen are still implemented in a sort of &quot;neutral&quot; way (helping both players).&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the author:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.&#10;&#10;&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.&#10;&#10;&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Like all the other games of the &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; series, this game is about building settlements, roads, cities and hiring knights. This time, there is no board on which to place little figures: Every player has his own score card called the building sheet, which depicts a mini Catan (compare with Die Siedler von Catan: Paper & Pencil). You build by drawing the settlements and roads on your score card.&#10;&#10;To build you still require resources. These are collected by a Yahtzee-like mechanism that involves throwing six special dice (depicting the different resource symbols) up to three times. After each roll, the player can select which dice to keep and which to roll again. In the end, he may build using the thusly determined resources, and is awarded victory points for any finished buildings, which are recorded on the score card.&#10;&#10;The game lasts fifteen turns or about 15-30 minutes, after which the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;Note that the game has been designed for 1-4 players, meaning there is a solitaire version of the game, as well.&#10;&#10;Recent versions include double-sided map sheets and instructions for Catan Dice Game Plus.&#10;&#10;",

Everybody will immediately try to find a suitable word. When enough words have been found will Meggie, the heroine of the story, move towards goal; if not will Capricorn move forwards. Only if Meggie manage to reach goal first will the gamers win the game!&#10;&#10;The game is based upon the highly succesful children's book &quot;Inkheart&quot; by Cornelia Funke. The novel is about the power of the word, and game designer Klaus Teuber of &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; fame have captured the enthralling and tantalizing atmosphere of the struggle of young Meggy and her father Moe on one side against the evil Capricorn and his henchmen on the other.&#10;&#10;Moe has the fantastic ability to read characters out of a story and into life. By this he brought Capricorn, the super-villain, into our world, who strifes to get all of his evil henchmen out of his book to help him with his bad deeds. But for this, he requires Moes services...&#10;&#10;The trilogy has captivated children all over the world, and a major movie was released in March 2008.&#10;So hopefully will we soon see an English language edition of this game.&#10;&#10;This is a game in the Kosmos line of literature-based games.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the designer, translation courtesy of BoardgameNews.com:&#10;&#10;Trapper is an adventurous family game for 2-4 trappers from 10 years old, in which players gather tiles lying on the table. Trapper is suited especially well for two players.&#10;&#10;Players are trappers in the Canadian wilderness, catching wild animals in the forests and lakes and searching for fungus and herbs. You ship your prey in canoes. As soon as one of your canoes is full, you sell the goods at the market. Both in the gathering of your prey and in the filling of your canoes, you need clever plans and foresight. Who will make the most valuable captures? The winner is the player who possesses the most money.&#10;&#10;The game offers two different versions: A basic version in which luck plays a larger share and a somewhat more demanding version for tactically-minded players.&#10;&#10;The basic game of Trapper is a simple game in the style of Verflixxt and Celtica that's suitable for a wide target audience. Good luck and tactics are about equal on the scales.&#10;&#10;The somewhat more demanding version offers more tactical possibilities. How should one advance with the animal gathering? Which is more lucrative, getting a few larger and very valuable canoes or bringing many small canoes with different species to the market? Both strategies can lead to success.&#10;&#10;",

There is no 'Zombie Master' here: all the players are on the same side, all working together to survive, although the option to use other players as zombie bait while you grab all the guns and lock yourself in the cellar is there if you prefer.&#10;Either way, you will need to use strategy and your (fresh and spicy) brains as well as chainsaws and shotguns to make it through the night.&#10;&#10;Each scenario has a location to be explored, and an objective to be fulfilled, but if things don't go well just survival may be enough. Cards drawn throughout the game may help or hinder your progress, but as the night draws on you can be sure things are going to get much worse before you see the sun again.&#10;&#10;The game ends when somebody fulfils the main objective (eg, escaping in a fuelled up vehicle), or at daybreak, which brings respite in the form of an advancing army patrol. If you can survive until the end of the game, you are a winner.

The game is quick (3-6 hours) and clean (map using area movement). Hearts and Minds uses most major events of the period, including proposed events such as the Macnamara Line which was never actually built. Although nominally a combat game, the mechanisms actually revolve around both sides occupying South Vietnamese provinces for propaganda purposes. The heart of the game is political influence. There is little doubt that the Allied player will eventually withdraw his American boys from the quagmire, but the question is, how quickly and in what numbers?&#10;&#10;Hearts and Minds contains 80 cards, tokens to represent the American army, the ARVN army, the NVA army, VC units of varying hidden strength, the Cambodian army, the Laotian army and a small contingent of international allies. Turn tokens, withdrawal tokens, reduced movement tokens as well CAS (Close Air Support), communist Air Suppression and artillery are also included. More rules cover Air Cavalry, naval support, Riverine interdiction, and bombers. Untried troops are a liability in the game; Veteran troops are a necessity. Ultimately, the Communist player must deal the American such a crushing public relations disaster that he will abandon his Southeast Asian allies before the momentum of those allies stalemates the irreversible infiltration of South Vietnam.&#10;&#10;",

Pirate warehouses are equivalent to settlements in Catan, and the player receive resources from these warehouses whenever a die roll matches the number showing on that island. These resources take the form of equipment cards, and the resources are wood, wool, rum, sabers and gold. With these, players construct ships and more pirate warehouses or buy development cards. Instead of a robber, players must now beware of a Ghost Pirate, which can block the resources normally provided by a warehouse.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with two pirate warehouses, and the first player to build seven warehouses wins. In order to build a new warehouse, however, a player must go by ship from an existing warehouse to a new construction site, which thus keeps players alternating between constructing ships and warehouses.&#10;&#10;Aside from the change in theme, other changes between The Settlers of Catan and Catan: Junior include the elimination of cities (i.e., warehouses can't be upgraded) and the distance rule between settlements, resources allocated by the roll of one die instead of a pair of D6s, and the introduction of a marketplace that allows trading with the bank. At the start of the game, one equipment card of each type is placed in the marketplace; on a player's turn, he can exchange one card in hand for a card in the marketplace. At certain times in the game, the marketplace is cleared and reset to feature one equipment card of each type.&#10;&#10;",
