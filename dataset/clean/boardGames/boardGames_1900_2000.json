        "description": "(from GMT Games:)&#10;&#10;Spring 1941: Nazi Germany is triumphant. Poland has long since vanished from the map. Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.&#10;&#10;Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) &#10;    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) &#10;    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) &#10;    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) &#10;    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) &#10;    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) &#10;    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)&#10;&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.&#10;&#10;It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin? As the world holds its breath, the decisions are yours.&#10;&#10;",

When you have four adjacent markers that are all on different colors, you can place a tower. Once the tower is placed, this spot is no longer usable for any other marker connections.

She rolls the dice one by one, stopping when she wishes, and the sum of the dice rolled can't exceed 7. If she rolls only one die, she moves forward by the number rolled; if she rolled two dice, she moves twice the sum of her dice (if the sum &le; 7); and if she rolled three dice, she moves three times the sum (again, if the sum &le; 7). If her sum exceeds 7, she removes her piece from the board and starts the lap from the beginning next turn.&#10;&#10;If one piece lands on another, the bottom piece must carry the top one when it next moves; what's more, the owner of the piece on top dictates how many dice the bottom player must roll &mdash; and if those dice sum to more than seven, then both pieces are removed from the track. Stacks can have any number of pieces, and whoever is on top dictates to the active player how many dice she must roll.

        "name": "This Accursed Civil War",
        "description": "This Accursed Civil War is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the First English Civil War: 1642-1646. It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three of four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.&#10;&#10;The battles included in this game are:&#10;&#10;Edgehill, 23 October 1642&#10;    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.&#10;&#10;First Newbury, 20 September 1643&#10;    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.&#10;&#10;Marston Moor, 2 July 1644&#10;    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.&#10;&#10;Second Newbury, 27 October 1644&#10;    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.&#10;&#10;Naseby, 14 June 1645&#10;    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.&#10;&#10;COUNTERS: 635 full-color die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;MAP: Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color back-printed mapsheets&#10;&#10;OTHER: &#10;&#10;    One 10-sided dice&#10;    16-page Rulebook&#10;    24-page Playbook&#10;    2 11x17 Player Aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ben Hull&#10;DEVELOPER: Marty Arsndorf&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.&#10;&#10;Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting.

        "description": "Drive on Paris, is a game simulating the first 100 days of fighting on the Western Front during World War I.&#10;&#10;The mobile campaign of 1914 in the west was the result of more than a generation of staff planning on both sides. The German General Staff had prepared the Schlieffen Master Plan of a giant right hook into France which its namesake had hoped would result in a Cannae-like battle of annihilation of France. The French believing that an attack would always win and that elan would carry the day, prepared to assault the lightly held German lines in Alsalce-Lorraine.&#10;&#10;Both plans failed.&#10;&#10;Drive on Paris allows both sides to execute the historical campaigns or variations on them and are rated for victory on how well their operation succeeds. Players can rearrange their Mobilization Points to change the change the force allocations from the historical ones to reinforce their effort or to better counter the enemy's.&#10;&#10;Both side must rapidly attack and defend at the same time...and you'll never have enough troops and power to do both perfectly, so your allocation of scarce resources will be the key to your success.&#10;&#10;This system uses a two-tracked method of determining victory. It isn't the usual &quot;one side tries something, while the other tries to stop it&quot;. Rather, both sides must strive toward their own goals while putting forth enough effort to stall the enemy. It is possible for both sides to &quot;win&quot; ending the game in a net draw (which is why you'll need to dedicate some effort to stopping the enemy support).&#10;&#10;Drive on Paris is the seventh game in the popular, easy-to-play Standard Combat Series.

        "description": "An early morning fog burned off with the dawn, and revealed two long columns of scarlet and blue clad troops. This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.&#10;&#10;General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.&#10;&#10;Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end. One bold stroke will free the land.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In all the spectacle of war there has seldom been a sight the equal of British General Burgoyne's campaign of 1777. The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.&#10;&#10;The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.&#10;&#10;The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;&#10;&#10;It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?&#10;&#10;As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?&#10;&#10;These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.&#10;&#10;",

Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.&#10;&#10;Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.&#10;&#10;In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.&#10;&#10;The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win. Any German player thinking he'll have an easy time, must be reminded his is not Nazi Germany's main effort and that he must make-do on a shoestring.&#10;&#10;Fallschirmjaeger is the eighth game in the popular Standard Combat Series by The Gamers.

Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).&#10;&#10;Every round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land.

These are claimed by placing a castle and cathedral on the specified area of the map board.&#10;&#10;Play commences with the Administrative Phase where players collect taxes based on the number of territories and cathedrals they control. Following is the Military phase that is divided into three optional steps. The first is to roll 2d6 for a random event that will cause the player to either gain or lose money, lose cards, lose castles or become the pope. The second option is to build new castles on your territories. The final is an attack on another person's territory.&#10;&#10;Territories can attack adjacent territories or those on the same body of water. The attacking and defensive force are determined by the number of castles on each territory. For each castle on his/her territory, the attacker and defenders each roll a die and apply any modifiers obtained by cathedrals or cards in his/her possession. Results of 6 or over destroy a castle of the opposing side. If all of the defenders castles are lost, the attacker wins the territory, places a castle to claim it and may draw a card at the end of the phase. Cards offer various benefits such as money, attack/defence points or game actions.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player controls 8 cathedrals.&#10;&#10;... and apparently the castles are cute.&#10;&#10;",

Star Trek Chess) was first detailed in Franz Joseph Schnaubelt's book, the Starfleet Technical Manual, published by Ballantine in 1975. A fan, Andrew Bartmess, got in touch with Mr. Schnaubelt and fully fleshed out the rules. It adds a third dimension to the game making chess more difficult. Vertical movement, as well as the tradition horizontal movement, creates many new moves and strategy.&#10;&#10;Reproductions of the original prop were sold by the Franklin Mint for a time.&#10;&#10;Roughly, there are three fixed 4x4 boards staggered so that the lower board's last two rows are under the middle board's first two, and likewise the middle board's last two rows are under the top board's first two. Four 2x2 movable attack boards attach to the corners of the fixed boards, above or under, so that the game actually has a total of seven planes (but only 16 of the 96 extra squares are &quot;in existence&quot; at any one time). The attack boards are also necessary as bridges between the fixed boards. Notation of positions and moves (since now there are sometimes several possible paths between any two starting and ending squares) is initially problematic, but well addressed by Mr. Bartmess.&#10;&#10;The standard set up is uneven, with the lower (white) board's attack boards starting above instead of under as called for by symmetry. This gives an advantage to white since he can reach the neutral board faster than black as a consequence.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.&#10;&#10;Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.&#10;&#10;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch&#10;&#10;The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.&#10;The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.&#10;&#10;",

The game's namesake, for example, appears in the Mark 1 and Mark V versions only.&#10;It uses a simplified system for maneuver and combat that emphasizes game play over realism, and is very playable. Realism buffs will want to modify the rules or look for a different game.  Changes in a plane's status are recorded by moving counters rather than using a pencil and paper.  Changes in elevation, for example, are indicated by moving a counter along a looped Climb Progress track (different in length for each plane) until passing the 'top', which means the plane has climbed to the next level. At this point the counter on the board representing the plane is replaced with one showing its new level (numbered 1 - 20). Hits are noted on the speed track, such that the plane's maximum speed is reduced as it takes more hits, until the stall speed is reached, when the plane is considered shot down. Each plane uses a unique firing table printed on its record card.&#10;A plane's maneuverability is characterized by its ratings for turns, barrel rolls, wing-overs, and diving costs, as well as its acceleration.&#10;Play set scenarios, or simply pit your favourite planes against each other in a dog fight!&#10;&#10;",

It depicted a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist coalition, the South American Union, and the Pan Asiatic League. The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map, with 400 cardboard pieces representing the armed forces in the war. As was typical of wargames of this genre, each piece had numerical combat and movement ratings printed on it. The board is divided up into small hexagons (each of which represented approximately 50,000 square kilometers). On each turn a player can move all of his pieces through a number of hexagon spaces equal to its movement rating. Then pieces in adjacent spaces engage in combat by comparing their combat ratings and rolling dice. The combat ratings and the dice roll are cross-referenced to determine the outcome of the combat. Many spaces on the map also have distinctive terrain features like forests or mountains which affect the ratings of units in those spaces.&#10;&#10;Invasion: America is intended as a four player game; one player is the defender and controlls the forces of the United States and Canada (Mexico and Central America were American-occupied territory). The other three players are the three invaders of the coalition. Each turn of the game represents one month and the game lasts for 60 turns. The North American player wins if he still controls a portion of the continent by the game's end. If the North American player loses, whichever of the invading players holds the most territory is the winner. The result is that the invaders cooperated to an extent in attacking the North American player but ultimately were competing against each other.  Invasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a 1978 sequel, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.&#10;&#10;Issued in both box format and flat tray&#10;&#10;",
