To have the best gang at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;In Famiglia, the players collect gangsters with the goal of collecting the highest-valued gangsters. With the exception of the 0-value gangsters, a player normally needs two identical gangsters (same family and same value) to be able to take a gangster with the next highest value of the same family. When a player does this, they place one of the smaller gangsters from their hand into their play area. To get higher-valued gangsters faster, the player may use the special abilities of the different families at the cost of placing more gangsters in their play area. By doing so, a player may reduce their options and so must carefully plan these actions in order to end the game with the most influential gang.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to become the most famous patron of the arts by hiring the most famous artists of the period and financing their works.&#10;&#10;Each player can commission artworks in his own district, the Cathedral, or in the civic buildings of the city. Each artwork requires money and resources to complete. To earn the money and resources the artists need, the players send their workers to labor in various workshops, possibly even in their opponents&rsquo; districts. Additional workers can be earned by offering charity to the church. During the game, players will earn prestige points, primarily by completing artworks. prestige points can be spent during the game, but at the end of the game they will be the player&rsquo;s primary source of victory points.&#10;&#10;All of the characters in the game are real historical figures that lived and worked in Italy during the Renaissance. Most of them worked in Florence. All of the buildings in the game were real Renaissance workshops. The artworks the players can complete include the masterpieces of some of the most famous artists in the world.&#10;&#10;Note from the designers directly from the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&quot;We apologize if we included some characters in the game who never worked in Florence during the Renaissance, but we wanted to include all of the most important artists (in our opinion) from that golden age of Italian art and culture. Michelangelo, for example, left an important mark on the history of the city&mdash;and the Renaissance period&mdash;even if he was only in Florence for a short time. We also added some portraits of military leaders (created by Ivan Zoni) to the rulebook. They are not involved in the game, but they were influential members of public life during this era.&#10;The names of the buildings, parts of the Cathedral, and the workshops are in the literal form they had in Italy during the 1400-1600 period. Some of them are unchanged in the modern Italian language, some have changed a little, and others have completely disappeared or remain only in some dialects. We chose to maintain those words, without translating them into a language that the real artists didn&rsquo;t know. We hope you agree with our choice, and we hope you have a good time playing Florenza!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

For instance, if the answer is &quot;true&quot;, one places his right hand on the plastic disk, as such creating a pile of hands on top of the disk. Please mind that the answer to the question might vary as a function of the number of players, the players itself, etc (see below). Mind that once you've put your hand, you cannot change your answer anymore.&#10;&#10;Once all players have answered the question, i.e. have placed one of their hands on the pile of hands, scoring begins. The upper hand scores +1 point if its answer is correct or -1 point if its answer is incorrect. The second hand (from the top) will score +2 if its answer is correct or -2 if its answer is incorrect, and so on. For instance, in a 8 player game, the lower hand (on the plastic disk) scores +8 points for a correct answer or -8 points for an incorrect answer.&#10;&#10;Players really have to take risks to improve their score, answering quickly and so having their hand smashed.&#10;&#10;To give you an idea of the questions, there are several types:&#10;Concerning the reader of the question (I am a man)&#10;Concerning the player (You have a dog)&#10;Concerning the environment/location (We play in a bar)&#10;General questions (King Kong was an ape)&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player has scored a specific number of points, e.g. 30 points in a 8 player game.&#10;&#10;Additional rules for some variations are included (like changing hands and playing in teams).&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Hand aufs Herz&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You might make good money with hotels, but first bridges must be built so that tourists, artists and business people of all kinds can flock to the islands. Plantations and cigar factories can show lush profits as well. Adventurers are attracted out to sea, where they dive for sunken shipwrecks and treasures. But the bottom line in Key West is that wanting everything is never a good goal.  Don't get bogged down; stay cool and plan your actions like a pro.&#10;&#10;Key West is set in the 1930s and depicts the economic development of the Florida Keys. Players build hotels, maintain fruit plantations, buy cigar factories (both producing and selling), ensure that bridges are built, and search the deeps for treasure and wrecks. It features an original and surprising auction mechanism from Martin Schlegel.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into two parts: first bidding, then actions.  At the beginning of each of the eight rounds, there is a offers phase, in which players bid to secure Key West cards, which represent, for example, ownership of bridges and plantations and other benefits for the subsequent actions round. Individual actions are a finite and players will need to approach them tactically.  It often won't be possible to do everything one wants and what not to do an agonizing decision.&#10;&#10;Both experienced players and families will find something to like in Key West. There are seven different paths for generating victory points, but those who try to get involved everywhere won't succeed. The focus should be on three or four programs. In the next game one can try a different set.  As there are thus many combinations, the intentions is that matters stay fresh for many re-playings.&#10;&#10;An Essen 2010 game.

Every cyclist enjoys the benefits of a free base movement which varies according to his specialty and according to the hexagon at the beginning of his movement. After this kind of movement every racer can add a paying movement. Therefore, the race is based on the riders' energy management: initially the riders are all inside the peloton, where it is easier to save energy, but then they will have to find the proper moment to break away to open the definitive gap ahead of the peloton.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hell of the North&quot; is a slang term for a one-day bicycle race originally from Paris to Roubaix that includes many sections of cobbled roads, sections that often lead to damaged bikes, falls and unexpected race results.

        "description": "&quot;Lost Battles&quot; is forty games in one. The game covers battles and campaigns in the Mediterranean and Near East from the Persian defeat at Marathon in 490 BC to Caesar's victory at Pharsalus in 48 BC.  It has been exhaustively tested and refined over the past several years, and is based on Professor Philip Sabin's decades of research and simulation design on ancient warfare; and it includes an updated copy of his book, with extensive historical and design notes on every scenario.&#10;&#10;The game can be fought on three levels - the grand tactical, the grand strategic, or a combination of the two.  At the grand tactical level, 1 or 2 players may refight any of 35 different land battles such as Leuctra, Gaugamela, Raphia, Cannae, Cynoscephalae or the Sambre - far more than in any other single boxed game.  At the grand strategic level, 1 to 4 players may refight the epic duels of the two centuries from 350 to 150 BC, starting with the eclipse of Achaemenid Persia by Alexander of Macedon, and ending with Hannibal's campaigns and the conquest of Carthage and the Hellenistic states by the resurgent Roman republic.  The most ambitious games combine these two levels, and see 1 to 4 players using tactical battles to resolve strategic campaigns across part or all of this two century period, or else refighting a series of historical battles to decide conflicts such as the three-cornered contest for dominance between Athens, Sparta and Thebes from the start of the Peloponnesian War to the death of Epaminondas.&#10;&#10;The accent throughout is on combining historical accuracy with speed and accessibility.  The free-standing strategic game may be completed in just 30 minutes, while individual land battles may be re-fought in two hours or less.  There is constant player interaction, and a series of tortuous dilemmas - how should the scarce command points be allocated across the battlefront, which troop types should be put in the lead against particular opponents, should units attack all-out at the cost of becoming exhausted themselves, and should generals join the fighting to rally their disheartened men at the risk of being killed and so making things far worse?  The game includes all the many troop types from hoplites, legionaries, phalangites and archers to cataphracts, scythed chariots and war elephants, and it includes simple rules to reflect the huge differences in generalship and troop quality and to allow outclassed armies to win a handicapped 'game victory' even if they are defeated on the field, as long as they do better than they did historically.  All aspects of the game are avowedly solitaire-friendly, and can be run by a single player swapping sides just as easily as by one or more players per side.&#10;&#10;Tactical battles are fought on a 5 x 4 grid of full-colour 5 inch square hard mounted terrain tiles, which dovetail to form any desired battlefield.  The individually die-cut counters have rounded corners and are also in full-colour; they depict the various different troop types. The strategic game is fought on a hard mounted map showing the area from Spain to India.&#10;&#10;",

In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.&#10; First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).&#10;&#10;With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so.

And, as before, they rob their opponents unscrupulously and ambush the president as often as they can in order to become president themselves. The players must pocket as much development aid as possible, use this to hire new militias and extend their estates. The player who does this the fastest wins the game.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;- 5 Estates (in 5 player colours)&#10;- 20 dice (in 5 player colours)&#10;- 45 cards&#10;- 5 summary cards&#10;- 5 player screens&#10;- 25 building tiles&#10;- 1 pair of presidential glasses&#10;- 1 set of rules&#10;&#10;Source: publisher blurb on www.spiel-check.de translated from the German (see: http://www.spiele-check.de/9712-Junta_Viva_el_Presidente.html)&#10;&#10;",

After Britain refused to deliver newly ordered Turkish battleships, the Turko-German fleet bombarded Russian forts, signaling the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;s entrance into World War One.&#10;&#10;Ottoman Sunset 2nd edition, by designer Darin Leviloff, is a stand-alone solitaire States of SiegeTM game on World War One in the Near East from 1914-1918. The player controls the Young Turks (CUP or Committee of Union and Progress) as they try to keep the Ottoman Empire alive amidst the struggles of the Great War.&#10;&#10;After many years of being the &ldquo;Sick man of Europe,&rdquo; by the late 19th century the Ottoman Empire attempted to reform and modernize itself. Ironically, such attempts convinced restive nationalities such as the Greeks, Romanians, Bulgarians, etc., to assert their independence and/or seek to expand their territory.&#10;&#10;This weakness caused other Imperial Powers to seize Ottoman territory, both formally and informally. By the outbreak of World War One, the Ottoman Empire was reduced to a core of territory in Asia Minor, the Levant, the Hejaz, Mesopotamia, and a sliver of European territory. This collapse led the military-political leadership in Turkey to take over under the guise of the Young Turks.&#10;&#10;The Ottoman Empire began with lofty strategic goals, but soon faced a hard slog, defending its core empire against far-flung British-led forces, Russian armies, and a Hashemite Arab revolt. Furthermore, ongoing campaigns on other fronts, such as those with Austria against Romania in the East, against Italy on the Isonzo, and of course the draining stalemate of the Western Front had a direct impact on events in this theater. Like Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire needed direct German aid to keep it in the conflict.&#10;&#10;Despite victories at Kut and Gallipoli, by October 1918, the Turks had about all they could take and surrendered.

Heights of Courage is a game covering the Golan Heights portion of this war&mdash;one of the largest armored clashes to occur since the end of World War II.&#10;&#10;For a little over two weeks,  massed Syrian armor tried to swamp the Israeli defenders who were buying time to allow mobilized reserves to arrive.  They succeeded and managed to turn the tide launching their own offensive toward Damascus.&#10;&#10;Heights of Courage is the 15th game in the award winning Standard Combat Series. It complements the 1995 CSR award winning game Yom Kippur (which covers the fighting in the Sinai). It uses the same 8 page standard series rulebook applicable to all the other games to bring out the action in a &ldquo;beer and pretzel&rdquo; way familiar to all wargamers.&#10;&#10;Because both sides have offensive and defensive phases of the battle to enjoy, victory is determined by comparing the best Syrian performance in their early offensive to the Israeli offensive results at the end of the game. This forces both sides to fight tooth and nail on both the offense and defense with enormous time pressure on perform rapidly.&#10;&#10;Designer Steve Newhouse (previously part of the team that created The Mighty Endeavor) gives all the sizzle of the fast-paced armored battle with enough steak to give the game the appropriate level of depth. For example, he gives an innovative two tempo operational speeds to both players as the battle goes beyond the endurance of the forces involved.  Each player can select to go &ldquo;fast&rdquo; in order to fight more or &ldquo;slow&rdquo; in order to get more replacements.&#10;&#10;While Heights of Courage cannot be directly linked to Yom Kippur, the game provides rules to allow players to play both games in tandem so as to play the &ldquo;whole war.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Scale: Each turn is between 1/2 to two days (depending on when in the battle the turn represents). Each hex is 1 mile across. Syrian units are battalions and brigades.

Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.&#10;&#10;Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game.

Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck.

Note that all 7s are higher than any 6, which are each higher than any 5, and so on.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player is dealt seven cards. Players pass 0-3 cards to their left or right neighbor depending on the round number. Players then predict the number of tricks they'll take by choosing a card in their hand and simultaneously revealing them. The player with the highest bid becomes start player for the round, and the color of that player's card indicates the trump suit for that round. These bidding cards are then returned to the players' hands.&#10;&#10;The start player for a trick lays down a card, and each player must follow the lead by playing a card of the same color or number. If this isn't possible, they can play any card. The highest trump card played (if any) wins the trick; otherwise the highest card played that followed the lead (including number!) wins the trick. After seven tricks, the round ends. Making one's bid nets two points plus the number of tricks bid, while missing results in a loss of one point for every under- or over-trick. The player with the highest score after seven rounds wins.&#10;&#10;An optional rule forbids the bids from summing to seven. If this occurs, the player with the highest bid scores one point, then the bid cards are set aside and players rebid from the cards remaining in hand.

        "description": "The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&#10;&#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;",

They filled the caverns with bodies and locked them away from the upper air.  Eventually the dead forgot the living--if any remain.&#10;&#10;But in death, a new life began.   The breath of evil from the darkness of complete shadow stirred corrupted flesh.  In their middens and pits, the dead awakened, swarming through slime-fluxing tunnels, seeking chthonic power, warring with demons and denizens of the deep. Animated by the black flame, necro-ecologies rose and collapsed in the crypt-universe.  Now, cloistered undead lich-wizards have discovered the primordial opening to the shadow source, the doleful horror-hole where the Eternal Evil Emperor watches and waits....&#10; The necromancers have dug their Lairs deep into the ground.  They must gather precious resources and body parts to assemble an army of minions, while defending their own lairs from the excavations and intrusions of others. In the end, the only route is into the demon path...&#10;&#10;Then depletion of your essence leads to spending another eternity in foul sepulchral darkness awaiting the next Awakening of Death.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of an ancient Necromancer.  Located deep within an earth, their Necropolises have now merged, each seeking the Darkest Pit, the location of all evil.  The dark wizards must build minions with precious resources from their Lairs to send forth and destroy, or dig further tunnels to locate other creatures, resources or to ambush another sorcerer.&#10;&#10;The game is won when only one remaining Necromancer stands. A Necromancer can either be destroyed by combat, or an enemy minion may venture into their Lair and crush the wizard's shadow power, a Chthonic Crystal. BUT an even greater darkness may befall the players.  As they build and destroy creatures the Dark Pit absorbs the shadowflame and may awaken the ultimate Cave Evil.&#10;&#10;",

It involved thousands of ships, stretched over hundreds of miles of ocean, and involved hundreds of convoy battles and single-ship encounters. During the struggle advantage switched back and forth between the U-boats and Allies as new weapons, tactics, and countermeasures were developed and implemented.&#10;&#10;U-Boat Leader takes the Leader series to new depths, letting players control a group of U-boats on missions in the Atlantic. The core system of the game will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to quickly get into the game.&#10;&#10;A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you concentrate your submarines in one or two areas to form wolfpacks or spread them out in the shipping lanes to increase the chances of finding contacts, or do you send them on special missions (such as mine-laying)? You can also spend Special Operations Points to support your submarines by adding search planes to help find enemy ships or by sending supply ships and subs (Milk Cows) to extend the endurance of the submarines. During longer campaigns you need to manage the U-boat patrol rotation to keep subs on station.&#10;&#10;When a patrolling U-boat comes into contact with an enemy force it can call other boats in the same patrol zone to form a wolfpack or attack alone. The action then shifts to the tactical display where the U-boats try to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to actually identify the ships.&#10;&#10;U-Boat Leader includes the following type of U-boats: &#10;Type IIB/C coastal submarines &#10;Type VII A/B/C Atlantic submarines&#10;Type IX A/B/C long-range submarines&#10;Type XXI Elektro-boat&#10;&#10;U-Boat Leader includes four campaigns covering different stages of the Battle of the Atlantic:&#10;&#10;The Battle Begins: covering operations at the start of World War II to about mid-1940.&#10;&#10;The Happy Time: covering the period from mid-1940 to mid-1941 when the U-boats and wolfpacks dominated the seas.&#10;&#10;Operation Drumbeat: covering operations off the American coast and in the Caribbean in early 1942.&#10;&#10;The Hunted: covering the time period when the tide starts to turn against the U-boats.&#10;&#10;-Dan Verssen Games&#10;&#10;Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns placing cards to build the park, attempting to place them in such a way as to minimize the hazards they must take on (waiting time, maintenance, and fear) while maximizing the points for building in a particular location.  The game ends once you've gone through the deck once.&#10;&#10;Recommended for families and experienced players; strongly recommended for two players.&#10;&#10;",

It is meant to be a feast that will long be remembered!&#10;&#10;The guests attending the feast hall feel the same, for in the corners of the castle deadly plots are being developed. The guests are divided into two factions, with both planning to &quot;dismiss&quot; the king. One faction plans to smuggle a dagger into the feast hall to &quot;open the king's heart to the realm&quot; at the right time, while the other faction hopes to give the king &quot;renewed motivation&quot; with a poisoned drink.&#10;&#10;In The Last Banquet, each player is a guest at the feast and needs to help his faction reach its goal and ensure that this will truly be the king's last banquet. The game includes 25 role cards, each portraying a person on the front and listing that person's skills on the back. In addition to &quot;The Last Banquet&quot;, several other scenarios are provided in the rules that can be played with each of the roles. (GameHeads' Oliver Wolf notes, &quot;Playing time ranges from 30 minutes up to 90 minutes or more, with more people tending to need more time to play.&quot; Also, some scenarios involve more than two factions.) Obstacle cards provide challenges for players to overcome.&#10;&#10;When a faction succeeds in its goal, all players who belong to that faction win the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The year is 1870.&#10;The World is at War.&#10;&#10;The world of Dystopian Wars is similar to our own, but subtly different. The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.&#10;&#10;Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset, so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.&#10;&#10;Spartan Games will supply highly detailed, high quality resin and metal miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.&#10;&#10;Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games, because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall game play and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.&#10;&#10;Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.&#10;&#10;We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.&#10;&#10;You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world. The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;",

In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire!

Players vie for dominance in the regions created by controling planets, nebulas, and asteroid fields. One player controls the movement and combat of the Alliance (blue) spaceforce, while the other controls the movement and combat of the Imperium (red) spaceforce. Each player, in turn, moves and then engages in combat with his units, in an attempt to capture (or prevent from being captured) key locations (e.g., planets) on the map. Finally, resources called Logistics Points (LPs) are gathered.&#10;&#10;Polybag Game Components:&#10;&#10;&bull; One 12-page, full-color Rulebook&#10;&bull; Two 8.5&rdquo; x 8.5&rdquo; Neutral Sector maps&#10;&bull; Four 8.5&rdquo; x 5.5&rdquo; Home Sector maps&#10;&bull; Two 8.5&rdquo; x 5.5&rdquo; Faction mats&#10;&bull; Two 8.5&rdquo; x 5.5&rdquo; Half Sheet Sequence of Play Aids&#10;&bull; Two 8.5&rdquo; x 2.5&rdquo; Play Aids (1 Turn Track, 1 Terrain Effects)&#10;&bull; 8 Scenarios (7 Humanity plus a bonus Humanity + Aliens)&#10;&bull; 1 Small Sheet of two-sided, multi-shaped, laser-cut* counters&#10;&bull; 12 Humanity Development cards&#10;&bull; 2 plastic Logistics Points tokens (1 Blue, 1 Red)&#10;&bull; Two 5mm, six-sided dice (1 Blue, 1 Red)&#10;&#10;What's In The Box?:&#10;&bull;    One 12-page, full-color Rulebook&#10;&bull;    Two 8.5&rdquo; x 8.5&rdquo; Neutral Sector maps&#10;&bull;    Four 8.5&rdquo; x 5.5&rdquo; Home Sector maps&#10;&bull;    Two 8.5&rdquo; x 5.5&rdquo; Faction mats&#10;&bull;    Two 8.5&rdquo; x 5.5&rdquo; Half Sheet Sequence of Play Aids&#10;&bull;    Two 8.5&rdquo; x 2.5&rdquo; Play Aids (1 Turn Track, 1 Terrain Effects)&#10;&bull;    8 Scenarios (7 Humanity plus a bonus Humanity + Aliens)&#10;&bull;    1 Small Sheet of two-sided, multi-shaped, laser-cut* counters&#10;&bull;    12 Humanity Development cards&#10;&bull;    2 plastic Logistics Points tokens (1 Blue, 1 Red)&#10;&bull;    Two 12mm, six-sided dice (1 Blue, 1 Red)&#10;&bull;    Two 8.5&quot; x 8.5&quot; mounted, jigsaw-cut Neutral Sector maps&#10;&bull;    Four 8.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; mounted, jigsaw-cut Home Sector maps&#10;&bull;    One bright red, 9 1/4&quot; x 5 7/8&quot; Standard cardboard VPG game box&#10;&bull;    One beautiful box cover sleeve&#10;&bull;    One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin&#10;&bull;    One charcoal dessicant packet&#10;&#10;",
