Where you start with a double domino.  You play 10 rounds, each round starts with a different double domino working your way down from double-nine to double-blank.  You must first fill the double chickenfoot with the 8 tiles that go around it. If you can't fill you must draw a new tile, it is like Uno in this aspect.  Once the chickenfoot is played you may play a new domino, either putting a number against a number or playing a double tile in a T arrangement across another domino, this becomes a new chickenfoot and must be filled before continuing, a player draws a tile if they can't finish the Chickenfoot.  The round ends when one player has no tile, or there are no tiles left to play on a chickenfoot.&#10;&#10;A fun game that can be played by gamers and non-gamers alike.&#10;&#10;",

To win a round players aim to have the most or fewest beads of each color. A set of condition and effect cards is laid out for each round which determines who will win extra beads, depending on their offers. Players select the number of beads to offer in a series of three exchanges, after each of which the condition and effect cards are evaluated, distributing additional beads depending on who offered the most or the fewest of each color. At the end of the round shrunken head tokens are awarded depending on whose set of remaining beads best matches the current arrangement of goal cards.&#10;&#10;After each round the goal cards, condition cards and effect cards are replaced. To win players must think ahead to understand whether an offer will likely give them more beads or less, depending on the cards in effect for the round. If players tie for a particular condition, the tied players are cancelled out, leaving the next player to follow the specified effect. This gives the game a rock-scissors-paper like feel where winning the round often depends on guessing how many beads the other players will offer.&#10;&#10;High quality components consist of pleasing plastic beads, iconic card art, and shrunken head tokens that are both charming and macabre.

The snakes' frenzy bring them to run between the trees and players must me able to &quot;pilot&quot; them to the apples, avoiding mushrooms, trees and the other snakes. The game is card driven (the cards are describe the possible movements).&quot;&#10;&#10;SnakeLake is a cross between the old computer game Snake and the board game Robo Rally, but is much simpler and faster than RR. You have a simple board with a grid and place some apple trees around, then each player chooses a starting point.&#10;&#10;Each player uses cards to program their next three moves in secret on their own chart, with the 2nd and 3rd move sliding down each turn when the 1st card is used and a new card going in the 3rd slot. The cards simply show forward, left, right (twice each) and one stop card. They also tell you to draw an Event card, which add some randomness.&#10;&#10;If your snake runs into a tree, or off the board when incomplete, or into another snake's body, you start over again somewhere else, reprogramming your next three snake moves. If you hit another snake's head, they go off and you score a point for each segment of their body. If you get your whole snake on the board and then get your head off the board, you score points for the length of your snake.&#10;&#10;But the big points come from eating apples which fall from the apple trees. These have 8-12 points on them, and your snake runs over them to eat them and reveal the points scored. Likewise, there are some mushrooms which deduct points if eaten. The apples and mushrooms are placed when an Event card indicates. The other events include removing an apple, sending an opponent's snake to sleep (miss a turn), and make your snake's body longer or shorter.&#10;&#10;Snake Lake is a light, fast, fun game and will suit children more than adult's. The best strategy seems to be eat an apple then get knocked off the board to start somewhere else, near more apples. Getting your whole snake on and off is hard work, and scores few points in comparison.&#10;&#10;The components are nicely made, good shiny cards that should wear well. The rules need a little proof-reading but were clear enough. Snake Lake might be better for 3 or 4 players than 6 though, it got very crowded very quickly, even on the large side of the board.&#10;&#10;",

The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.&#10;&#10;Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities.  Each route must consist of at least three cities.  Players may only build one route at a time.  Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.&#10;&#10;Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card.  The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards.  On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one.  If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it.  The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage.  Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route.  Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn.&#10;&#10;When a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered.  Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends.  Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, and lose points for unplaced post offices.  The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.&#10;&#10;",

It's possible for only one house to be placed, if the wall is placed along the outside of the game board.&#10;After placing the wall, the player rolls three dice to determine the color of one of the towers (the color of a possible second tower may be freely chosen), and that of the two houses (if only one house is placed, then the player may choose which of the dice to pick for the color of the house).&#10;Finally, if the newly placed wall causes a piece of land to be fully enclosed, a new city has been established. If the new city borders one or more existing cities, it may be combined with one of those cities. Two houses of the same color inside the city are upgraded to a palace. A scoring round is now triggered, during which all players get to play one or two &quot;guild cards&quot;, and then draw one new card.

The soccer player names are quite hard to say because the author deliberately invented really strange and long names.&#10;&#10;To win you have to put the ball in the net more times than other team.&#10;&#10;The game is noisy and hilarious. Each coach gets an action card. Each player get a &quot;number&quot; that represent the t-shirt number of the figures they will control (more than one there are less than 14 players).&#10;&#10;Only the coach see the action card and have to call BY NAME (of soccer players not of the people playing the game) to indicate where to move to without talking, without indicating the wooden soccer players. The only way to communicate is to give him indications with his hands or miming something as real coach do.&#10;&#10;Every time a wooden soccer player is in the right position the coach scream &quot;PASS IT&quot; and so on the other wooden soccer player until the last is positioned and the coach screams &quot;SHOOOOOT!!!&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;All the players stop play. If the team is positioned exactly as the action card requires, the last player who moved a wooden soccer player for the team throws a die to score a goal.&#10;&#10;Some penalties are given to the coach for performing forbidden actions (like calling wooden soccer players by number or indicating it by pointing) and if the action card is not correctly reproduced.&#10;&#10;RETHEMED : HysteriCoach Hockey&#10;&#10;",

Whenever a building is completely rebuilt, its tile is turned back over to its rebuilt side. The players who helped with a building get crystals and dragon favors, which can be traded in for crystals at certain times.&#10;&#10;The player who first manages to add the required number of markers by paying crystals to the Obelisk wins the game.

Often, they were not able to repay him in cash, so they awarded him special privileges, such as trade rights and offices.&#10;&#10;2 to 5 players ages 12 and up assume the role of the merchants from Augsburg and try to get what they can -- by means of auctions -- from the nobility, thus increasing their wealth and particularly their social status.&#10;&#10;The game play uses a simple bidding mechanism. Each round, players offer cards of varying values in a series of five auctions. Once a bid is made, players either raise the bid, call, or drop. The winning player may choose from a set of possible actions that increase abilities (and more importantly, points).  After a number of rounds (dependent on the number of players), scores are tallied. It's that simple.&#10;&#10;This is a game by Karsten Hartwig, whose other game &ldquo;Chinatown&rdquo; was already published by Alea. Game length varies -- depending on the number of players -- between 25 to 90 minutes. The difficulty level is a 4 on the Alea 1-10 scale (the same as Ra).&#10;&#10;Besides the players&rsquo; tableaus and a game board, there are 90 game cards and various game chits.&#10;&#10;This game is #3 in the Alea medium box series.&#10;&#10;",

Although political and tactical victory was the bottom line, collecting the severed heads of enemy samurai reigned a very close second in importance. In terms of tactics, this was, as in Europe, the Dawn of Modern Warfare, with the introduction of guns - arquebuses - by the Portuguese. Even with the revelatory effect of musketry, Japanese battles were still pretty much a swirling, non-linear affair.&#10;&#10;RAN, the name the famous Japanese film director, Kurosawa, chose for his samurai version of King Lear, roughly means &ldquo;Chaos.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The Battles of RAN (all battles are one-half map, except for Tennoji):&#10;&#10;&#10;    MIMASETOGE (6 October 1569): The Takeda are trying to return to their castle base, and the Hojo are trying to intercept and ambush them with twice their number.

        "description": "This game lets each player take on the role of a Northern Chinese prince. His task: the construction of a massive wall. His reward: Honor everlasting! To gain the honor, though, requires some sweat. The requirements are the same for each player. Each player has a set of cards in his color: seven wall cards (worth 1 point), three gate cards (worth 2 points) and one watchtower card (worth 3 points). Additionally, each player gets nine more cards of varying point value and which may also allow special actions to be carried out.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player shuffles his deck of 20 cards and places it face-down in front of himself. He then draws five cards from the deck. Now, depending on the number of players, 2 to 4 pairs of prestige tiles (with values from 1 to 8) are set out as the starts of card rows.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he first checks to see if he has a point majority in any of the card rows. Then, he carries out two additional actions. He has the choice of either drawing another card from the deck or adding cards to one of the rows. The added cards must  be identical. It is then the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;If, when checking point totals, a player sees that he does have one or more majorities, then he chooses one of the prestige tiles and puts it onto one of his cards in that row. That prestige comes at a price: as long as the second prestige tile isn't claimed, the value of the prestige is subtracted from that player's total for that row. Once the second tile is claimed (which can be by the same player on a later turn), then both winning players set the tiles they won aside to score. Two new prestige tiles are revealed and the prestige for that row replenished.&#10;&#10;The fight for prestige is also influenced by cards with special actions. For example, if a 'noble' card (1) is played, then the values of all cards in that row are reduced to 1. A 'dragon' card (1) can be played onto another player's card, neutralizing it. 'Cavalry' (2) are worth 2 points, and, equally valuably, do not cost an action. 'Infantry' (5) are strong in groups. A single 'infantry' card is only worth 1 point, but the next one is worth 2, and then 3, etc.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player has played his last card or when the last prestige tile is taken. Afterwards, each player gets one last turn and then all card rows are resolved in turn order. The player with the most prestige at the end of the game wins.  Players only receive prestige for tiles they have set aside for scoring.  Tiles remaining on wall segments do not score.&#10;&#10;",

The original title, &quot;Auf der Reeperbahn...,&quot; alludes to a popular German movie from 1954.&#10;&#10;Near the center of a 17-space track start the six game figures which the players compete to attract to their opposite ends of the board.  You play as many cards of the same color on your turn as you wish, and much of the movement is a direct result of card play:  e.g., by playing a red 4 you bring the red figure (&quot;Rote Lola&quot; or &quot;Dancing Deb&quot;) 4 spaces closer to your end of the board.&#10;&#10;However, there are special tricks and restrictions which must be learned and held firmly in mind before the sense of the game begins to emerge.  The central green figure (&quot;Brilli-Lilli&quot; or &quot;Saucy Sue&quot;) which wins for you if the game ends with her on your half of the board, for example, can only move within the bounds of her &quot;bodyguards,&quot; two grey figures.

The companion green figure (&quot;Schampus-Charly&quot; or &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot;) which can also win the game if you get him into one of the two spaces at your end of the board (your &quot;nightclub&quot;), only moves toward you if the board situation at the end of your turn involves both bodyguards on your half of the board and/or one of the other figures in your nightclub.  And so on.&#10;&#10;The game, part of the Kosmos two-player series, is one of attack and counterattack, defense and forward thinking, and can be won early or on the turn of the last card on the second time through the deck.

Rather unusual landscape types need to be crossed in this game: Clay flats, fields, hot sand, green lawns, water and cobblestones, even some rare blue-white or beige tiles. These landscapes are found on 28 large landscape cards, each of which again is made up of 18 landscape spaces, arranged in random fashion.&#10;&#10;The landscape cards get mixed up and distributed among the players (7 each with 3p and 4p, 8 with 2p - the rest go back in the box). Now, each player gets to set two particularly difficult cards aside and places the rest on the table to form a race circuit (the narrow sides of the cards are joined together). Thus, a different track with different challenges is created for each player. A goal card marks the goal for each player.&#10;&#10;Before the game can begin, 48 small cards are placed in the middle of the table as a face-down, spread out pile. Each card shows one of the landscape types mentioned above.&#10;&#10;As soon as the game starts, all players wildly grab through the pile of cards on the table. Cards, once revealed, are left face-up if they're not of immediate use. Cards that a player wants to keep are taken in hand. The order of the cards being collected, though, cannot be altered in any way. The collection phase ends when there's only face-up cards left on the table and a player calls &quot;stop&quot; because he thinks he has enough cards.&#10;&#10;Now, the players will see how far they get along their track with the cards they collected. The player who called &quot;stop&quot; starts. He turns the first card he collected over. If it's sand, for example, he puts his marker on a sand space at the start of his course. Thereafter, each subsequent card must show a landscape type that is next to the one his marker is on (either sideways, forwards or diagonally forwards) for him to move forwards. As soon as a card comes up that doesn't allow him to move his marker, his turn is over. Collected cards that are left over are put back into the middle of the table (face-down), and the figure stays where it managed to get to. Each player in turn order then does the same, moving their figure and returning leftover cards. Continue in this manner, round after round, until one player reaches the goal, ending the game. That player is of course the winner.&#10;&#10;Description of the game from Kosmos.&#10;&#10;",

As usual, the question isn't &quot;Will the Romans get beat up?&quot;, it's &quot;How badly will the Romans get beat up?&quot;&#10;&#10;The two players play as Asterix and Obelix. Each takes the matching playing figure as well as a set of 15 beating cards (3 cards in each of 5 different colors), which he places in front of himself as a face-down deck. Each player takes the top 5 cards in hand. In addition to the beating cards, there are Roman cards. Most of them show Roman Legionnaires (in 5 different colors), but there are also Pirates, Wild Boars, the traitor Moralelastix and 5 Village Feast cards.&#10;&#10;The 40 cards are well shuffled and placed as a face-down pile. Then, the top 16 cards are drawn and placed face-down on the table in classic Phalanx formation (4x4 grid). The remaining cards act as a draw pile.&#10;&#10;The player with the longest mustache (or alternately the biggest belly) begins. He places his figure in front of one of the four Phalanx rows and turns the topmost card over. A red Roman! Red Romans can only get beat up by Red beating cards. If the active player doesn't have any, then the Roman card is turned back over again and that player's turn is over. If he does has a red card, though, then he has to choose whether to end his turn (taking the beaten Roman as a trophy) or turn another card over, hoping to press his luck.&#10;&#10;A player can keep going until (in an extreme case) he's cleared an entire row of the Phalanx. In that case, the active player gets to refill his hand to 5 cards and then start in on another row. Of course, that may not be such a good idea. Because if he keeps going and finds a Roman card he can't beat up, then his turn is over and he receives nothing. All of the Romans he would have won are removed from the game instead. Players can reduce the luck a little bit, in that they can discard one card from their hand to look at the last card in the row where they placed their figure.&#10;&#10;When a player ends his turn (freely or because he was forced to), then he refills his hand to five cards and it is the other player's turn. Any holes in the Roman Phalanx are also filled back in with cards from the draw pile. Lastly, the player whose turn just ended gets to block the next player from trying one of the rows (either horizontally or vertically).&#10;&#10;Of the 40 Roman cards, only 30 show actual Romans (as well as Zenturios himself). The remaining 10 cards are: 3 Pirates, 1 Wild Boar, Moralelastix, and 5 Evening Feasts. Pirates are easy to beat: Any card will do. To get Moralelastix, two cards of a single color are needed. The Wild Boar ends the player's turn immediately, but he gets to keep the Romans he beat up on so far. If a Feast is revealed, nothing happens and the player gets to keep going. Revealed Feasts are set aside, and once the fifth Feast shows up the game is over.&#10;&#10;Now, the players count their victory points. The purple point goes to the player who got Moralelastix. A brown point is for the most pirates. The majorities in the five Roman colors are worth the red, blue, yellow, green and black points, respectively. The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Every German sub deployed between 1939 and 1943 (as well as some what-if classes) is represented with its very own counter, each meticulously and accurately drawn and shown from their side in full-color. Players familiar with Silent War will find Steel Wolves takes the system to new depths, while those trying it for the first time will be able to quickly get into action!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the Publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Spartacus is a two player, card-driven, point-to-point simulation pitting a loose coalition of forces under Sertorius against the Roman Republic as restructured under Sulla and his lieutenants.&#10;&#10;As the Sertorian coalition, your objective is to force the Republic into collapse in order to rebuild it as it was before the Sullans changed the constitution. This is done through putting pressure on the Republic by territorial conquests, by exacerbating the tensions in the Republic, forcing it to utilize the services of new, potential Sullas to counter your armies in the field, or by taking Rome itself!&#10;&#10;As the Republic, you must defeat and neutralize Sertorius quickly, before he can conclude an alliance with Mithradates VI and cause a two-front war. However, the levying of too many troops to fight the enemy coupled with the utilization of ambitious generals can bring on the very circumstances you are trying to avoid, collapse of the Republic. In addition, care must be taken with Italy itself because in the background, civil war looms in the guise of Lepidus, and even worse, a slave revolt under the able gladiator-leader, Spartacus.&#10;&#10;Both sides can battle their adversaries using conventional forces, conduct guerrilla and pacification operations with the intention of denying your opponent control of strategic spaces and provinces, and attempt to hasten or delay the political collapse of the Republic. The central mechanism that influences all actions in the simulation is the Republican Crisis Track, which monitors the level of crisis in the Republic. All actions on the battlefield, the state of the empire, the strain of recruiting legions and utilizing ambitious generals, and the use of power politics, are ultimately reflected on the Crisis Track. The Sertorians hope to move the track towards heightened crisis while the Republic hopes to keep it well away from a political collapse. In the end, if the Republic manages to avoid collapse, it can still lose by having a strong, Sertorian presence on the board.&#10;&#10;Spartacus requires the player to successfully exercise many facets of military-political acumen in order to defeat his opponent while preserving the most precious asset of all, survival.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(from Compass Games website):&#10;&#10;Red Storm Over the Reich is a Ted Raicer game covering the epic final campaigns of WWII on the Eastern Front, as the forces of the Soviet Union smashed the German armies defending Poland, East Prussia, and Pomerania, and advanced across the Oder to Berlin. Included in the game are three scenarios.&#10;&#10;The first scenario is historical, which finds the German forces out of position. Their armies will likely be shattered on the first turn, but the victory conditions are tough on the Soviets&ndash; they must do at least as well as historically.&#10;&#10;Scenario two has the historic forces, but allows the Germans to implement Operation Sleigh-ride, a sane pull-back of the main defense line along the Vistula out of range of the opening Russian barrage (an operation historically nixed by Hitler) that at least allows for a more orderly flight.&#10;&#10;Scenario three combines Sleigh-ride with reinforcements from other fronts. It assumes that Hitler has had an incapacitating stroke in late November or early December, and the new Nazi leadership is sufficiently uncertain of its position that it defers in military matters to Guderian. The Ardennes Offensive is cancelled, as are the attempts to relieve Budapest, as well as substantial forces are evacuated from the Courland pocket. This increases German strength on the main eastern front by approximately 50% and doubles German tank strength, which, when combined with Sleigh-ride gives the Germans some serious fighting strength.&#10; Scenarios one and two can be completed in 8-12 hours and scenario three in 12-16 hours, depending on your individual playing style.&#10;&#10;Red Storm is the opposite of 1941 East Front Games: The Soviets have assembled a massive force and will rip gaping holes in the German lines through blitzkrieg-style attacks. The German player must somehow piece together a desperate defense only to have it repeatedly blown apart by the enemy. But time is the enemy of both players in this game. The Soviets need to accomplish their victory by the end of the last turn, satisfying the historical timeline, or they lose the game, and the Germans must delay the Soviet assault on Berlin long enough to prevent the Soviet win.&#10;&#10;The rules for Red Storm Over the Reich are moderate in complexity but feature enough chrome for both sides to recreate this desperate campaign. Special rules include: the creation of Kampfgruppe divisions (or not), naval evacuations, panzerfausts, Volksturm divisions, Leaders, Soviet Logistical Constraint, Hitler mandated attacks and more!&#10;&#10;Included with each game are two maps each 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo;, two sheets of counters (456 total), rules, set-up charts, tables, dice and game box.&#10;&#10;",

Frederick's gamble nearly destroyed Prussia, but a few stunning victories over numerically superior forces, many delaying actions, British gold, and the timely death of Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia saved Prussia and ensured Frederick's place in history as a great general.&#10;&#10;Prussia's Defiant Stand recreates the fierce struggle for mastery of Central Europe. Using the well-proven, card-driven action system the game showcases the importance of maneuver, fortresses, sieges, supply, and the potentially costly option of winter campaigning. The countries of Prussia, Austria, France, Russia, and Sweden are represented with units for leaders and artillery, heavy and light infantry, cavalry, Cossacks, and fortresses.&#10;&#10;Players will have difficult choices in managing their cards as some can be used for &quot;commands&quot; to move units, or used to modify combat odds.  The game mechanics reflect the period's focus on maneuver for position and a &quot;Frictions of War&quot; table beautifully models the indecisiveness of many allied leaders.  This explains more than anything how the small nation of Prussia was able to withstand the combined weight of the most powerful states of the day.  Frederick himself attributed Prussia's survival more to the timidity of allied commanders than to his own actions.&#10;&#10;This game is available now at www.worthingtongames.com&#10;&#10;",

New game mechanics support a simulation which must encompass planes with very different flight capabilities and firepower, while still keeping the flow of the combat simple as it is in the WW1 series. The innovations to maneuver cards and to the fire deck system provide all the needed historical accuracy with no headaches to the players!&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Dawn of War&rdquo; is the first set in the new series of Wings of War games, which will allow you to re-create dogfights, bombing missions, escorts, and endless other aerial combat situations set in World War Two. Including fighter planes from the first years (1939-1941) of the war, but also used later in the conflict, &ldquo;Dawn of War&rdquo; provides the foundation for a new, exciting evolution of the Wings of War system. Pilot a Spitfire, a Messerschmitt, a Hurricane, a Wildcat, a Zero... Up to 6 planes can fly with the contents of this set, for scenarios with 2 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Part of the Wings of War series&#10;&#10;Re-Implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Wings of War: WW2 Deluxe set&#10;     Wings of War: WW2 Airplane Packs&#10;     Wings of Glory: WW2 Starter Set&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Take on the role of a colonial power seeking fame, glory, and riches in the New World.  As you proceed through three ages, you can launch expeditions of discovery, colonize regions, expand your merchant fleet, build capitol buildings that give your nation distinct advantages, develop your economy, and, if necessary, declare war.&#10;&#10;Though originally published for 5 players, the game is playable by 6 with the original components and board configuration with addition of a set of figures in another color.  This was originally offered as an &quot;expansion&quot; and an incentive to pre-order the game. A 6 player expansion is also in the Glenn Drover's Empires: Builder Expansion, along with new capital buildings and National Advantage tiles.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with Age of Discovery.&#10;&#10;",

The Halls of Montezuma is a Card Driven Game, allowing players the opportunity to recreate the various events and actions in Mexico from 1846 to 1848. The historical cast of characters is here, from Doniphan to Arista, Scott to Santa Anna. Even Lee, Jackson, Beauregard and Grant make appearances.&#10;&#10;Strategy card play allows you to move your forces, make events happen, activate the fleet, secure control of your lines of communication, and even invade Mexico with General Scott.&#10;&#10;The outcome is never a foregone conclusion. Victory comes from driving Mexico's political will down to zero; but each battle's outcome is in doubt - a few troops performing superbly can defeat many troops performing poorly. Mexico can achieve a quick sudden-death victory before the U.S. has declared war and can bring its force to bear.&#10;&#10;Will Santa Anna arrive early and retake Tejas?&#10;&#10;Can General Scott take Mexico City?&#10;&#10;Play The Halls of Montezuma and find out!&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rules booklet&#10;     Deck of 110 Strategy &amp; Action cards&#10;     One 22x34 mapsheet&#10;     Player aid cards&#10;     Quick Start card&#10;     Two 5/8-inch counter sheets &#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS Michael Welker &amp; David Fox&#10;DEVELOPER William Cooper&#10;COUNTER ART Rodger B.

        "name": "Won by the Sword",
        "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Situation:&#10;&#10;The war raged across Germany from 1618 to 1630 with the Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor retaining the upperhand. Then the tide of war changed when King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, the &quot;Lion of the North,&quot; revitalized the cause of the Protestant princes of Germany. Bankrolled by France, the Swedes pushed their advantage towards the Emperor's most valuable ally, Maximilian of Bavaria. Though Catholic, France sought to keep the power of the Habsburgs in check by financially supporting the Swedish King.&#10;&#10;From 1632 to 1648, Bavaria and the surrounding area became a crucial battlefront to knocking Bavaria out of the war. The Swedes enjoyed success until fate removed their King and their over-extended forces could not hold onto their gains. After the Swedes suffered a sharp defeat at N&ouml;rdlingen in 1634, France was forced to play a more active role or lose all she had paid for. A series of seesaw campaigns ensued as the French Arm&eacute;e d'Allemagne secured crossings of the Rhine and pushed the war back into the heart of Bavaria. The area became the proving ground of the greatest generals of the age - Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Mercy, de Werth. Neither side possessed a clear superiority of forces so it was a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, march, counter-march, siege, and surprise attacks. After several years, a combined French-Swedish campaign finally broke the back of the Bavarians in 1646 and Maximilian made a separate peace. It did not last long; after a year he reluctantly rejoined the Imperial cause. Repeating the winning combination of 1646, the French-Swedish army ended Maximilian's enterprise at Zusmarshausen in 1648.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Game:&#10;&#10;Won by the Sword is the first game in Ben Hull's Great Campaigns of the Thirty Years War series. It is a two-player game of operational warfare in the 17th Century. Armies maneuver on a point to point map of Southern Germany based on the road network available at the time. Each game is centered around a major battle or full campaign season. A Turn is a month divided into a variable number of impulses. Each army has a hand of Campaign Cards that control the amount of activity it may perform, the supplies it must expend, and a special action. Each impulse features one card play per army. Forces are concealed off map so players are faced with limited knowledge of the enemy. The major activities are maneuver, foraging, besieging fortifications, and an occasional battle. Won by the Sword is a low-complexity game with emphasis on the players maneuvering their forces, but many decisions await. The low rules complexity allows each player, rather than being encumbered with rules, to focus on choices regarding how to manage his campaign.&#10;&#10;Battle Games:&#10;&#10;    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634&#10;    Tuttlingen 1643&#10;    Freiburg 1644&#10;    Mergentheim 1645&#10;    Alerheim 1645&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Full Campaigns:&#10;&#10;    1632 - The Lion of the North Goes South - Gustav Adolf's Campaign against Bavaria&#10;    1634 - Swedes are pushed out of the South&#10;    1638 - Weimar's Triumph - Duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar leads his German corps in French service to turn the tide of the war in the South&#10;    1644 - French battle to secure the Breisgau and Baden, Bavarians defend masterfully&#10;    1645 - Struggle for W&uuml;rttemburg - French and Bavrians fight a seesaw battle for control of W&uuml;rttemburg and N&ouml;rdlingen area&#10;    1646 - Turenne's Triumph - French and Swedes launch a joint campaign to bring Bavaria to her knees&#10;    1648 - The Bitter End - Zusmarshausen, again a combined French - Swedish force strikes into the heart of a resurgent Bavaria&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 5 to 7 days per Turn &#10;MAP SCALE: Point to Point&#10;UNIT SCALE: &#10;&#10;    Infantry Regiments = 800-1000 men&#10;    Cavalry Regiments = 400-500 men&#10;    Detachments = 200-300 men&#10;    Artillery Units = 8-10 guns&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;    One 34&quot;x22&quot; map&#10;    Four countersheets&#10;    One deck of 55 cards&#10;    One Rules Booklet&#10;    One Campaign Booklet&#10;    One 8.5&quot;x11&quot; Battle Board&#10;    Two 8.5&quot;x11&quot; Player Force Cards&#10;    Two 11&quot;x17&quot; Player Aid Cards&#10;    One 10-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ben Hull&#10;DEVELOPER: Stephen Brasseur&#10;MAP ART: Knut Gr&uuml;nitz&#10;COUNTER &amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch, Charlie Kibler, and Rodger B.
