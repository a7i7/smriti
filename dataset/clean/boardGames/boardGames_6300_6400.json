Prepare to find yourself on the other side of the barricade&hellip; Waves on waves of Goblins try to conquer the city of the humans, through debatable strategies, inconsistent plains and brainless &quot;Epic Death&quot;.&#10;&#10;Goblins is a not collectible card game that melds the bases of the board game with those of the card game.&#10;&#10;Raze the town to the ground and loot everything you can find on your way to leading a mob of stupid Goblins! Other Goblin commanders will collaborate on this task as well. Unfortunately, the idea of collaboration among Goblins is a little bit ambiguous. Dealing with useless subordinates and treacherous allies, the enemy will be the last of your problems.&#10;&#10;Players must destroy the Town and conquer as many Land Cards as possible. Land Cards will award the owner Victory Points. The player with the highest amount of Victory Points wins the match.&#10;&#10;To reach their objective players can rely on Goblin commanders, the alter ego of each player on the battleground; each of these has unique and particular ability to make every game different from the other.&#10;&#10;Unlikely Machines, fearless Goblin heroes and a lot of Action Card make the game always unpredictable.&#10;&#10;The innovative game system is based on &quot; Goblins flipping&quot;. Every choice you make will cause Goblin flip to determine its life or its death. Every Goblin is represented by a disk with two faces: every disk shows a Goblin face on a side and a Goblin skull on the other side.&#10;&#10;The game is exciting every moment also when it isn&rsquo;t your turn. No player will ever be too strong or too weak and the game strategy will change turn after turn suiting better possible the situation.&#10;&#10;Through the system of the exhilarating &quot;Epic Deaths &quot;, your Goblins can commit mass suicide in eccentric ways. The &ldquo;Epic Death&rdquo; can confuse every enemy and allows you to beat him for the dismay. No player is ever out of the game.&#10;&#10;Let the fight for stupidity begin!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes in order to rid yourself of cards and win the game.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of cards, and players take turns revealing one card at a time in separate piles. If two face-up cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the totem in the center of the table. The faster player then gives his face-up cards to his unfortunate adversary. To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the totem by mistake. Whoops! Mess up like this, and you must take the face-up cards of all opponents. Other cards force all players to grab for the totem at once or otherwise change game play.&#10;&#10;Jungle Speed: Rabbids adds a few twists to the basic Jungle Speed game, starting with a &quot;Raving Rabbids&quot; character that sits atop the token. If a player grabs this Rabbid &ndash; even when someone grabs the totem by mistake &ndash; she can give a card from her face-down stack to the player of her choice. Other cards have players race to create rabbit ears on their head or grab the Rabbid without knocking over the totem. Another special card forces everyone but the active player to close their eyes, while the active player moves the totem to some point on the table within reach of everyone; the other players (with eyes still closed) then race to find the totem first using only their hands. Don't gouge your neighbor too much!&#10;&#10;",

Basically this game is a duel, but the rules introduce also other ways to win - dimplomacy, intrigues and using military force. At once up to 5 sides - factions - can play.&#10;&#10;The plot of the game is settled in the historical reality of the 17th century, Poland's heyday, the times of the gentry, covering Europe and Asia. The designers also referred to the Polish historical and contemporary prose, like Henryk Sienkiewicz (Nobel prize winner) and Jacek Komuda.&#10;&#10;In 2009 Ku&#197;&#186;nia Gier became the publisher of the game. This new publisher reprinted the basic decks designed by Wydawnictwo Imperium and added a new starter deck of Osmanowie (the Ottoman Empire - this faction was introduced by the Casus Belli expansion in boosters). Ku&#197;&#186;nia Gier released their first own expansion in 2009 and further two in 2010. The line is constantly expanded with new products.&#10;&#10;Veto CCG has now seasons of the game (each season starts with releasing a set of sarter decks and contains next three expansions), which is connected with rotation of legal cards in the organized tournament system. So far Veto has had three full seasons: basic season (Veto 2ed, Charakternicy, Casus Belli, Ogniem i Mieczem), Warcho&#197;&#130;y i Pijanice (eng. &quot;Dipsos and Troublemakers&quot;, inlcuding Ogniem i Mieczem (partly), Do szabel, R&#196;&#153;baj&#197;&#130;owie, Krwi) and Szpiedzy i Dyplomaci (&quot;Spies and Dimplomats&quot;, including W niewoli, Spiskowcy, Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo). The current season is called Czarty i Upiory (&quot;Devils and Ghosts&quot;) and will introduce a supernatural element to the otherwise historical game.&#10;&#10;In July 2014 Historical Games Factory became the new publisher of the game.&#10;&#10;In Veto 2ed. there are 5 factions - decks (in the first edition there were only 4):&#10;&#10;- Awanturnicy&#10;- Dworscy&#10;- Radziwi&#197;&#130;&#197;&#130;owie&#10;- Wi&#197;&#155;niowieccy&#10;- Osmanowie (added by the Casus Belli expansion and fully present in the game until Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo, now illegal in most organized tournaments)&#10;&#10;SGK Veto 2ed. has also several expansions with brand new cards:&#10;&#10;Basic season:&#10;- Veto 2ed.&#10;- Charakternicy&#10;- Casus Belli&#10;- Ogniem i Mieczem&#10;&#10;Warcho&#197;&#130;y i Pijanice:&#10;- Do szabel&#10;- R&#196;&#153;baj&#197;&#130;owie&#10;- Krwi&#10;&#10;Szpiedzy i Dyplomaci:&#10;- W niewoli&#10;- Spiskowcy&#10;- Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo&#10;&#10;Czarty i Upiory:&#10;- Cmentarzysko&#10;- Danse Macabre&#10;- Malleus Maleficarum&#10;&#10;Potop:&#10;- Initium Calamitatis Regni&#10;&#10;",

Both players have only four pieces &ndash; chick, giraffe, elephant and lion &ndash; and they're trying to either catch the opponent's lion or move their own lion to the other side.

(Interestingly, in Xiangqi and Tamerlane Chess, the elephant moves precisely two spaces diagonally.)&#10;     The chick is directly analogous to the pawn/soldier of Shogi, and is promoted to a full-grown chicken, equivalent to the gold general in Shogi.&#10;     The lion is analogous to a king, except that he can win essentially by promoting, as long as it doesn't leave him in check.&#10;     Even on this 3&times;4 board, you are still able to drop in pieces that you captured from your opponent!&#10;     Unlike in Shogi, you can drop a chick for mate or have two chicks in a column.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

One player takes the role of the Doctor in all his regenerations, and his opponent assumes control of his arch enemy, The Master.&#10;&#10;At his disposal, the Doctor has a roster of companions from his past to help struggle against the renegade Timelord, featuring Rose Tyler, Romana, Adric, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, etc. His equipment includes, amongst others, his Sonic Screwdriver, K-9, jelly babies', and the Hand of Omega.&#10;&#10;The Master has a wide selection of villainous temporal marauders to choose from: Zygons, Ood, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, Robots of Death, Omega, The Valeyard, Sutekh, and The Rani, etc. He even has the meddlesome option of starting an Interstellar War - much like he did between the Draconians and the Earth Empire in Space War. His deck also features such interesting devices as the Laser Screwdriver, Tissue Compression Eliminator, and a Raston Warrior Robot.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. The Twelve Doctors is played using a 3-column time-line system, representing the battle for Gallifrey, Earth present and future, and Earth past. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with companions EX-TER-MI-NATED! frequently, and marauders being dropped into black holes, or destroyed by the well-placed use of Venusian Aikido.&#10;&#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, The Master has 3 planets that he can atomise during the course of each game: Telos, Metebelis III, and Skaro. This is in addition to the damage he may wreak upon Earth or Logopolis, etc, through cardplay. Destroying a planet has long-term consequences for the player, as well as short-term benefits. The Doctor, on the other hand, has the Journal of Impossible Things to use, but if he does so, makes the game easier for The Master to win.&#10;&#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has three values: power, cost, and disrupt. Both player's decks are also a measure of the time they have remaining to thwart each other.&#10;&#10;The Twelve Doctors lineage can be traced back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech CCG, and Iliad.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Whoever cannot draw a card has lost.&#10;     The Master wins if he disrupts more cards than the Doctor has left in his deck.&#10;     The Master wins if Gallifrey's power is reduced to zero.&#10;     The Master wins if Earth's power is reduced to zero (past and future).&#10;     The Master wins if all 11 incarnations of the Doctor are regenerated/destroyed.&#10;     The Master wins if 5 tokens are placed upon the Wirrn.&#10;     The Doctor wins if all 6 incarnations of the Master are regenerated/destroyed.&#10;     The Doctor wins if 5 tokens are placed upon Lucy Saxon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Whoever gets 5 Key to Time cards in play first wins (expansion victory condition).&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The estimated gameplay time is 15 &ndash; 30 minutes.&#10;Participants play the roles of the eponymous kingpins &ndash; mafia bosses. The objective of the game is to defeat the enemy mafia, led by the opponent.&#10;&#10;In Kingpin, players choose between three different crime syndicates: the Italian Mafia, the Russian Mob, and the Yakuza. Each organization has different pieces, changing the style of each game. The Yakuza prefers quiet assassinations, the Russian Mob overcomes its opponents with sheer firepower, and the Mafia specializes in swift drive-by shootings. The game &quot;neo noir&quot; theme borrows heavily from cult gangster movies and graphic novels, such as the works of Quentin Tarantino or Frank Miller.&#10;&#10;Three important features of the game are: a two-sided game board featuring two different maps, three victory conditions available for the players, and the lack of randomness during play. The authors describe it as a fast-paced game of nerves, somewhere between a Mexican standoff and a game of chess where the rooks and bishops run around with Tommy-guns.&#10;&#10;Because of the suggestive theme, the publisher considered this title unsuitable for children.&#10;&#10;The game contains the following components:&#10;&#10;- double-sided board,&#10;- 24 gangster tiles,&#10;- 3 action tokens,&#10;- 12 fire tokens,&#10;- game rules.&#10;&#10;",

In the span of only four minutes the war in the Pacific was changed forever. The chance convergence of the Enterprise and Yorktown Strike Groups between 10:22 and 10:26 AM on June 4th led to the devastation of the Japanese flattops and sparked the infernos which would engulf the Japanese Empire.&#10;&#10;Like its predecessor, The Hell of Stalingrad, Midway drops you right into the seat of the action. You make the strategic decisions necessary to first locate the enemy fleet and then destroy it! Scramble your fighters and organize your Strike Groups for their deadly missions. Will they destroy the enemy and make it back? Your squadrons must contend not just with the enemy's anti-aircraft fire and fight vicious engagements with the enemy's CAP, but also navigate the wide and empty expanses of the ocean. Do the survivors have enough fuel for the return trip to your fleet? Or will they too be lost forever to the misfortunes of war?&#10;&#10;The Fires of Midway explores in separate scenarios the four major carrier battles of 1942: Coral Sea, Midway Island, Eastern Solomons, and Santa Cruz. Also included is a campaign game linking them all together in which players must husband their resources not knowing which of these battles, if any, will yield the decisive result and turn the tide of war in their favor like the historical battle of Midway did.&#10;&#10;The Coral Sea can be played in as little as 1 hr and up to 2.5 hrs for the Midway Battle.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     200 playing cards&#10;     1 sheets of counters&#10;     1 large deck of 18 Carrier Cards &#10;     3 Play Mats&#10;     A 16 Page color Flight Manual (Core Rules) &#10;     A 24 Page Operations Manual (Advanced Rules)&#10;     Dice (2 different colors, D-6)&#10;     Box&#10;&#10;&#10;",

During their reign, two daughters of the House of Gonzaga married Holy Roman Emperors. In Gonzaga, players must get into the expansionist spirit of the times and build fiefdoms across Europe to stake a claim on harbors and cities, while also trying to complete secret missions. The game lasts 7-12 rounds, and players are competing in some of six regions in Europe. (The number of regions and the specific regions vary based on the number of players and the scenario tile drawn at the start of the game.)&#10;&#10;A round starts with each player drawing a fief card from their individual deck; each fief card depicts one of twelve fiefs: plastic components comprising multiple hexagonal loops with castles on some of these loops. Each player then secretly chooses both a region card and an action card, then reveals them simultaneously. Part of the fief (but not all of it) must lie in the chosen region, and the action card determines whether a player must play the fief on one or more harbors, on one or more cities, on open land, or on both harbors and cities. With this last action &ndash; the alliance card &ndash; a player can alternatively place one or two of six individual rings on the board, even on spaces that another player has already claimed with a fief. You score points for covering cities and harbors, for connecting at least three harbors in a sea, and for setting aside your fief as a donation to the church. The cards you play are set aside for the next turn, thereby forcing you to switch regions and actions as you place fiefs.&#10;&#10;The game ends either after twelve rounds or after a trigger point based on the cities and harbors not covered. The player with the most connected fiefs, including the individual rings, scores a bonus, then players reveal their hidden objectives and score based on the number of target cities they covered.&#10;&#10;",

When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game; conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.

To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.&#10;&#10;The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.&#10;&#10;So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your &quot;half of all pesos in the middle&quot; is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions.&#10;&#10;These different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar. It's shorter and lighter than many similar games, as well.&#10;&#10;",

Each marker has a number ranging from zero to five which represents the number of nobles that the player is placing in that area.  Most actions in the game require a player to remove a noble cube from an area in order to perform an action in that area.  Players also have income-generating estates in the different areas of Poland, and these holdings may determine which areas a player is most eager to defend.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players may raise private armies and use them to strike at the five nations that threaten the different areas of Poland.  If a player is successful enough at attacking an enemy nation, then that nation may not have the resources to attack Poland that turn.  Later, a roll of four die will determine which enemy nations receive reinforcements, and then enemy nations will take their turn attacking Poland.  A successful enemy invasion of Polish territory may result in players losing one or more estates in that region.&#10;&#10;&#10;Bo&#197;&#188;e Igrzysko - Dzieje Rzeczpospolitej Szlacheckiej.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nierz&#196;&#133;dem Polska stoi&quot; -  nie&#197;&#186;le kto&#197;&#155; powiedzia&#197;&#130;;&#10;Lecz drugi odpowiedzia&#197;&#130;, &#197;&#188;e nierz&#196;&#133;dem zginie.&#10;Pan B&oacute;g nas ma jak b&#197;&#130;azn&oacute;w.

        "name": "Granada",
        "description": "Granada &ndash; many artisans, traders and entire families have settled at the foot of the Sierra Nevada because the Palace of Alhambra promises all people work, contracts and above all prosperity.&#10;(From the publisher's blurb.)&#10;&#10;Granada is new member of the Alhambra family with a more challenging character: in this standalone game the players develop the city of Granada next to Sierra Nevada, where the famous Alhambra stands, by buying building tiles to construct the city which will earn the most victory points. Building tiles now have two sides and there are new building types for which the value is set during the game.&#10;&#10;Link to Trailer http://www.queen-games.de/index.php?id=2537----2&#10;&#10;Play Differences from Alhambra&#10;Alhambra advanced. Play is the same: buy a building tile, take money or remodel. If you buy a tile for the exact amount, you can take another action, same as in Alhambra. The differences: new building types, building values are dynamic, two-sided tiles, and moats instead of walls.&#10;&#10;There are 9 building types in Granada. Unlike Alhambra, the buildings do not have a set value. Instead, building value is determined by the count of that type of building in all players' cities times a multiplier. As in Alhambra, there are 3 scoring rounds during which each building type is examined and points awarded for the player with the majority of that type of building. In the first scoring round, A, only the player with the most tiles of a particular building type scores for that building type (1 times the total count). In the second scoring round, B, the top 2 players score (2 times the total count and 1 times the total count respectively), and in the final round, the top 3 score (3x, 2x, and 1x the total count of that building type). Scoring for a &quot;Beginners Game&quot; is a little different.&#10;&#10;There are no ties in Granada: points are never divided like in Alhambra. In the case of two players having the same number of tiles of a particular type in their cities, the player with the highest valued tile of that type wins, and the other player takes next place. So, in Granada, it pays to buy the more expensive buildings.&#10;&#10;For example: When the A round-scoring card is turned up, Cindy has 2 Schools, Diana has 2, Tim has 1, Tina and Bailey each have 0, for a total of 5 Schools currently in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Diana's is a 7. So, in round A, Cindy would score 1 x 5 = 5 points.&#10;&#10;When the B round-scoring card is turned up, the count for Schools is: Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina and Bailey 0 each for a total of 6 Schools. So, Diana scores 2 x 6 = 12 points and Cindy scores 1 x 6 = 6 points.&#10;&#10;In the final round, the School count is Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina 2, Bailey 0 for a total of 8 Schools in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Tina's is a 4. So, Diana scores 3 x 8 = 24 points, Cindy score 2 x 8 = 16 points and Tina score 1 x 8 = 8 points.&#10;&#10;Another difference in Granada is that the tiles are two-sided: on one side an even-numbered building of some type, on the other a different, odd-numbered building valued exactly one higher. The configuration of the buildings on both sides is identical in terms of moat placement or lack thereof on each side. When purchasing a building, a player can immediately place the building, as is, into her city or may flip it to the other side and place it in her supply for later placement during a remodel action.&#10;&#10;The Building Market is initially filled with tiles even-side up. The next time the market is filled, the odd side will be placed up, then even, then odd, etc. A handy toggle feature is provided on the board near the Building Market to facilitate this.&#10;&#10;The last difference between Alhambra and Granada, moats instead of walls, is really just a difference in artwork. As in Alhambra, during each scoring round, each player scores points for her longest continuous moat, instead of wall, surrounding her city. The rules are the same regarding tile placement: must be able to trace an unbroken path back to the city's center, moat can touch moat, etc. In games I've played, players have often commented that it seems to be harder to build with the moat tiles of Granada than with the wall tiles of Alhambra. Just one more way to make Granada an advanced version of Alhambra?&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

All of the forum posts, and linked items are being moved to the individual game entries, with anything sufficiently generic being linked to the Summoner Wars Master Set. All content will be maintained.&#10;&#10;Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game.  Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.  These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens.   But most notoriously, they summon their great race&rsquo;s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.  A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.&#10;&#10;Each Starter Set of Summoner Wars contains 2 complete, battle-ready Factions, ready to jump you and an opponent into the thick of the War for Itharia.  Each Faction is a unique race or civilization with its own secret goals, be it wild-eyed Elves bent on revenge, or blood-crazed Goblins who merely want to set the world ablaze.  Starter Sets also include everything you will need to play, including a Battle Mat, Wound counters, dice, and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;But the war doesn&rsquo;t end there!  Summoner Wars is fully expandable with entirely new faction decks such as the hideous Undead of the Fallen Kingdom, or the righteous and knightly Human Vanguards.  In addition, each Faction will have its own expansions, adding new warriors, summoners, and abilities to allow for a never-ending mix of combat options and surprises.  Expansions will also include Mercenary units - warriors who care nothing for politics and will fight for any side that can afford them!&#10;&#10;Summoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games.  By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing.  During the game, players summon and move their various warriors about the battlefield using their unique powers and abilities to wreak havoc on the enemy lines.  In the course of a game each side will inflict terrible casualties upon the other in their brutal quest for victory.&#10;&#10;Note: This entry in the BGG database is used to consolidate questions and discussion regarding the Summoner Wars series; it does not correspond to a particular box or deck of the Summoner Wars game.

        "description": "The players are builders in Ancient Egypt, competing to get the most fame building different monuments requested by the Pharaoh (the Sphinx, the Obelisk, the Temple, and the Pyramid).&#10;&#10;The game lasts 5 turns. In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.&#10;&#10;In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &quot;pawns&quot; are placed, since &quot;workers&quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).&#10;&#10;When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).&#10;&#10;After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards.

The first card played each round must be face down and does not have to follow suit. When all cards and meeples have been played for the round points are awarded for cards claimed.&#10;&#10;The different types of cards score in different ways:&#10;People cards - add up their printed values and multiply with the number of people cards. Then remove cards from game.&#10;Animal cards - compare the number of animals to the reference card for points. Keep cards in front of you. Animals of the same type claimed in previous rounds are also counted.&#10;Building cards - are placed facedown under the chest token until the end of the game. Points are awarded for sets of colours.&#10;Colour-mismatched cards can be discarded for 10 points each or add to a collection of animals/buildings.&#10;Dragon/fairy cards - score 10 points each and are removed from game.&#10;&#10;",

Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance. Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;        Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Aware of the resounding defeat that the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered the previous day at the hands of the Hitler Youth, the 7th prepares a Fortress around Bretteville, Norrey and Putot. The soldiers of The Regina Rifles and The Royal Winnipeg Rifles, still under-strength from their D-Day losses, wait their turn for the inevitable encounter with the Grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division.

Show that you have the courage, the right tactics and the necessary pinch of luck to become the chief physician .....&#10;&#10;You work as veterinarians in a nutty pet clinic.

To gather therapy points you have to deal with the strange therapies in the nutty pet clinic.&#10;&#10;Every therapy card is worth at least one therapy point. In order to cure your animal patients it requires a lot of therapy cards. Therapy cards are uncovered one after the other and placed in a row. Whoever thinks that enough therapy cards are displayed places his doctor figure below the last uncovered therapy card, since as soon as a second therapy card of the same kind is uncovered, chaos breaks out in the nutty pet clinic, ending this phase of the game immediately. Whoever has placed his doctor figure in time receives one therapy point for every uncovered therapy card up to his doctors figure, the others are left empty-handed.&#10;&#10;To gather a larger amount of therapy points, the players have to use the special functions of the clinic rooms on the gameboard.

During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space. But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place. The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins. Some later versions of this game come with dozens of different variants to keep the game interesting.&#10;&#10;Tante Tarantel (Aunt Tarantula) scoots round her web, gobbling up your insects as they try to escape. The web is a spiral, you roll the die and move Auntie, then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood, if she runs into a bug or bugs, they go back to her larder. But as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track, and each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up, also adding a number to the die roll. So Auntie runs around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but most of the time, bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs push others into Aunty's path to certain death!&#10;&#10;Slightly confusing when you start, this is actually a really simple game, easily as good as any D&amp;F game. The original set had wooden pawns for the bugs, but D&amp;F issued a series of neat rubber bugs, which do add to the games' style.&#10;&#10;",

As with the standard version of this game, one can win a military victory, either as Sauron and the Shadow Armies if he conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds, or with similar conditions when playing as Fellowship and Free People. The game may also be won by the Free People by completing the quest of the Ringbearer and trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Hidden movement prevents Sauron's awareness of the real intention of his enemies and keeps him looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring. The Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Limited and different choices are offered each turn through the roll of action dice which dictate the type of actions may be performed.  The choices range from personal character actions to political and military decisions through which to develop your winning strategies.&#10;&#10;The War of the Ring Collector's Edition brings all that was in the base game and introduces factions, new characters and new events from the expansion, including Galadriel, the Balrog, the Ents, Dunlendings, Siege Towers, Catapults, Corsairs, and more. It is a complete game with updates to the original game rules and incorporates the expansion rules and cards to allow for new strategies to play out.  This increases both the offensive options of the Shadow Forces and defensive options of the Free Peoples.  This all-in-one version of the game is deeper, more comprehensive, and offers both more, and more difficult, choices of what path to pursue to victory, and where to spend one&rsquo;s resources. The additional armies and characters of this version also enrich the theme and make it more true to the entire Tolkien saga of the Ring War.&#10;&#10;",

Each die is covered with six kinds of Egyptian archeological treasures, the artifacts of Pharaoh Teubernus: a gold lamp, a gold coin, a scarab beetle, a lapis lazuli vase, a piece of gold and jade jewelry, and a hippo statuette.&#10;&#10;A player can collect any treasure tile that matches the symbols he or she has rolled. For strategic reasons, a player might be better off rerolling some or all of his or her dice to try to match a particular shape and pattern of tile. Players can roll the dice up to three times in all per turn. &#10;Players can rotate treasure tiles in any direction when placing them on their excavation site grids, but they may not move the tiles once they are laid down. Tiles cannot overlap one another or hang beyond the edges of a board. &#10;The first player to cover his or her excavation site board completely with treasure tiles wins the game.&#10;&#10;In an easier version of the game, players are allowed to shift their treasure tiles around after placing them down, which makes it less difficult for kids to pick and use additional tiles to cover the board.&#10;&#10;",

One word is up/down and the other is left/right, and they share a vowel or consonant. Whoever makes a certain number of word pairs first, wins. Pairpoints is a variation that includes a more elaborate scoring scheme (1 point for non-pattern-matching words, 2 points for matching words, 5 points for finishing first).&#10;&#10;The large, ivory-like tiles show capital letters in four designs: solid, outline, lines and dots. The different patterns function like different suits of cards. As there are four suits, each containing a complete alphabet, there are a total of 104 tiles. Just as in a deck of cards, each tile is unique (e.g., the G of solids or the H of dots). This adds an interesting new dimension to play with (although the games in the rules only ask that a word consist of same-pattern letters).&#10;&#10;The instructions emphasize the educational value of the tile set: a fun way for children to develop memory and cognitive skills while learning alphabetical order, word construction, vowels, vocabulary, rhyming, and more.&#10;&#10;",

Feeding on you and your people and spreading the deadly MV1 viral infection. Welcome to The Zombie State: Diplomacy of the Dead.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;You are the world leader of a group of nations.  Each turn zombies feed and randomly spread throughout your territory, quickly reducing your population and increasing the number of zombies. At the beginning of the game you have no technologies or military that are effective against the viral threat on a worldwide scale.  Each turn you must maximize the use of resources to draft and use military, test technologies, and then strategically use these successfully tested technologies.  As the game progresses, outbreaks and the spread of zombies makes the game more difficult through a loss of population, resources, and freedom to act.  However, if you have been an effective leader you will have developed effective technologies that you may use to try and eliminate the threat from your territory completely. Otherwise leaders will find the game ends with the total conversion of their population into the walking dead.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(from the designer and GMT Games website:)&#10;&#10;Unconditional Surrender! World War 2 in Europe (USE) is a strategic level game covering the World War II European Theater. Players make the political decisions and control the military forces of the three major factions that struggled for European dominance and survival.&#10;&#10;With its emphasis on force projection and decision making, players remain focused on the big picture of managing their front lines and political opportunities. Through simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the strategic action without a myriad of complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.&#10;&#10;As one gamer put it, &quot;It is a delight to be spending my limited brain power on making (or agonizing over) operational decisions that are as dependent upon guts as they are gray matter. This game is not a series of arithmetic exercises, and the only variable in these algorithms is nerve.&quot;&#10;&#10;Though the focus is on the big picture, Unconditional Surrender! still delivers historical detail. Each country has an historical army level order of battle, and its relative economic strength and national will to fight are effectively and simply modeled. Also represented are such World War II events as airdrops, Free Forces, jets, naval evacuation, partisans, radar, railroad artillery guns, and ULTRA; all neatly woven into the game's core mechanics for ease of play&#10;&#10;The game has many scenarios ranging from quick playing individual campaigns to longer ones covering up to the entire war.&#10;&#10;Design Highlights&#10;&#10;     Scale: army, fleet, or air wing level units; 30-60 miles per hex; monthly turns &#10;     Players: 2-4&#10;     Playing Time: 30 minutes to 50 hours, depending on the scenario&#10;     Low On-Map Counter Density: The number of counters on the map is relatively low.&#10;     Simple Stacking: No more than one air, ground, convoy, or warship unit per hex.&#10;     No Factors on Counters: There are no combat or movement factors on counters.&#10;     Single Combat System: One combat resolution sequence and Combat Results Table covers all types of combat, yet the results differ for air/naval, ground, or strategic combat. &#10;     Integrated Movement/Combat System: Units move and fight in a combined activation. &#10;     &quot;Use it or Lose it&quot; Economic System: Simple math with minimal record keeping&#10;     Historical or Variable Entry: Units and events can enter play using an historical or variable time line. &#10;     Variable Politics: Most countries&rsquo; belligerence and faction alliance is not predetermined.&#10;     Solitaire Friendly: Though not designed with solitaire rules, the mechanics easily allow one player to play the game.&#10;     PBEM Capable: The game can be played using PBEM software, but its mechanics require frequent exchanges.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:    Monthly Turns&#10;MAP SCALE:     30 to 40 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Army, Fleet or Wing&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Salvatore Vasta&#10;DEVELOPER: Mark Dey&#10;MAP ART: Salvatore Vasta &amp; Mark Simonitch&#10;COUNTER ART: Charlie Kibler&#10;&#10;",
