Those who survive the finale win the game!&#10;&#10;It won't be easy. After every round of player turns, the NPC killer, Otis, stalks the closest targets around the board, attacking whenever he gets the chance. Unarmed players PANIC, are injured and forced to run away. Those lucky enough to have found protection are able to fight Otis with a dice roll. Better  weapons mean higher value dice and a greater chance of success. Beat Otis and he disappears form the board until re-emerging from the woods on his next turn.&#10;&#10;Be warned, as the body count rises, Otis gains strength, moves faster and becomes more deadly. Just when you think you're safe, you may find him waiting right in front of you!&#10;&#10;If that's not bad enough, players must draw Cabin Cards which have a wide variety of game changing effects, both positive and negative. They contain Plot Twists, Cameos, weather changes, special Otis cards, clever Campers, helpful Weapons and Items, and fate tempting &quot;foolin' around&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;The Counselors won't give up so easily. In addition to their own inherent talents, Survival Cards grant the players unique abilities and tactics to help elude or confront the killer.&#10;&#10;Who, if anyone, will survive?&#10;&#10;",

If the diggers manage to find the gold hidden under one of the goal cards, then the diggers share the loot found there; if the gold can't be reached before the deck runs out, the saboteurs profit instead. After three rounds, the player with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;This version of Saboteur includes the base game plus additional role cards (the boss, profiteers, geologists), new action cards (steal gold, change your role), and new tunnel cards featuring doors, ladders and bridges. What's more, the gold seekers can now be divided into teams &mdash; blue vs. green &mdash; and only those on the team that finds the gold score anything &mdash; assuming that anyone finds the gold at all, of course...&#10;&#10;",

Water immediately floods into the liner's compartments and the ship is listing to starboard in a worrying way. There is no hope about the outcome. On board, there is widespread panic.&#10;&#10;Alone, or co-operating with other crew members, you must show presence of mind and do the right thing to save as many passengers as possible. Time is short...&#10;&#10;The card game SOS Titanic uses a mechanism similar to Patience, with the cards representing passengers who must be arranged on the decks, then placed in the lifeboats in a particular order. As one of the crew members, you and your teammates need to move and arrange these passengers as quickly as you can. Each section of the Titanic holds a pile of cards of which only the first is available.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player draws a few cards from the main deck and tries to move passengers out of the sinking ship onto the lifeboats. Failing to move at least one passenger or needing to reshuffle the main deck might cause one section of the ship to sink, thus reducing the number of piles available as well as the hopes of those still on board. Players can also use action cards to step in at fateful times when things otherwise seem lost. The game ends when the ship has sunk completely or when all remaining passengers have been saved.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has control over three caravans. In the beginning, each caravan consists of three cards that are spread out vertically so that the top part of each card is visible; each card stands for a caravan member with different abilities.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player performs only one action, choosing one of the cards on top of the three families and executing one action shown on that card. Then the card is put at the back of its caravan. To use the same caravan member again, a player must first use all the other cards on top of that caravan row.&#10;&#10;These actions can influence the player's stock of spice, gold and mules. To keep track of that stock, each player has his own board with wooden markers that are moved accordingly. Actions can also bring new members to the caravans and can enable the player to fulfill one of four delivery request cards from the middle of the table. Finally, there are actions that mix things up a bit, such as by getting rid of a caravan member or even influencing other players' caravans.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has earned 25 points by collecting character cards and fulfilling delivery request cards.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism of Kashgar could be called &quot;open deck-building&quot;. The game plays quickly with little downtime. After having learned the different actions of the cards, players can start trying out different strategies and combinations of caravan members, caravan sizes, etc.&#10;&#10;",

Devices start simple with just two components (one source and one component), but devices with three, four or more components will become possible &mdash; as soon as the players assemble a device to let it be possible. Because of the modular mix-and-match nature of the components, the available action spaces vary widely from one game to the next, providing great replayability: each game players will create devices never seen before!&#10;&#10;",

Each has special powers and affects the stack (stak) in different ways, making it more tactical than a simple rock-paper-scissors exercise.&#10;&#10;The game functions by giving each player a stack of cards as well as a hand.  Each turn, players take a new card from the shared draw pile and may add a face-up card to the stack, trash a card from the stack or from their hand.  When a card is played, it will have &quot;entry effect&quot; that may operate on the stack ordering of the player or opponent.&#10;&#10;Once all playing/trashing is finished for a turn, the player may attack the card on top of an opponent's stack with the top card of their own.  The battle itself is quite simple and just a matter of comparing power, although assuming your bot survives its first battle, it can go on to attack the newly revealed card underneath.  The real tactical consideration goes into the pre-attack stack manipulation phase.&#10;&#10;There is an open turn structure which allows players to carry out actions in any order and any number of times. This means they can react to the often unpredictable results of long entry effect chains, or to cards that their opponents play defensively during your turn.&#10;&#10;The game is also customisable: you can adjust the complexity or game length by adding more Staks for each player or by changing basic game mechanics.&#10;&#10;",

Two to four players begin the game by choosing an ability-granting Role Card and starting in the United States. Players roll a die to initiate the zombie threat, represented by horde tokens of strengths 1 through 4 placed in zones around the board. Special &quot;grey zones&quot; represent lack of intel by featuring face-down tokens with zombie hordes of unknown strengths. Throughout the game, players travel to different zones and battle the zombie hordes in those locations by rolling dice and adding effects of Combat Cards.&#10;&#10;The game features a die-based combat system. Humans always roll a six-sided die, while the hordes are represented by either a six-, eight-, ten-, or twelve-sided die depending on their strength. Humans may modify their role or add additional effects by playing Combat Cards, which consist of reusable Weapons (including Lobos, slang for &quot;Lobotomizers&quot;) and one-shot Tactics (like Booby Traps or Redeployment). Every time a human wins a battle, the zombie horde strength decreases by one level, while victories for zombies cause players to discard Combat Cards. At the end of each turn, humans draw a Threat Escalation card to reveal how the zombie threat has grown.&#10;&#10;Though players start the game working together against the zombies, when a player loses all his Combat cards, he becomes one of the undead. Player-zombies can manipulate the hordes on the board to attack other humans and to escalate the zombie threat.&#10;&#10;The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds based on the number of players (six rounds for four players, seven for three, and eight for two). At the end of the game, if more than ten total zombie hordes of strength 3 or 4 still remain on the map, the humans lose (and any zombie players win).

This boxed set represents the fictitious 15th Anniversary World Championship Edition of Romance of the Nine Empires, and (to slip into the movie storyline for a second) it holds the decks used by the top-placing characters for each faction that made it to the quarterfinals at the 2012 World Championships at Gen Con Indy.&#10;&#10;So there's 3 levels of reality at play here:&#10;&#10;&#10;     the CCG game called Romance of the Nine Empires, pictured in the movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate, which is played by the characters at Gen Con Indy 2012 and is 15 years old;&#10;     the fantasy world of Countermay, which is pictured in the CCG game and whose history is shaped by the players of the CCG game;&#10;     the real card game Romance of the Nine Empires, edited by AEG in 2013, which comes in a boxed set and is inspired by (and presented as) the fictitious CCG.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?&#10;&#10;BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.&#10;&#10;If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who'll get his shot off first? Play continues until one team meets its winning condition &ndash; and death won't necessarily keep you from winning as long as your teammates pull through!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Something Different is a card game that started out with a simple idea: A game in which the rules change as you play. What it evolved into is a fantastic party game in which players get to know each other and engage in hilarious challenges.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a deck of 100 cards. Each player starts with a hand of seven cards and is attempting to empty his hand to win. Next to the main deck, three cards are turned face up, each with a different rule. Each turn you play a card on one of these piles from your hand, changing the current rules in play. If you break a rule at any time, you draw a card. Sounds simple enough, but it gets better. The basic rules tell you which color cards you can play or what suit they need to be, but other cards may restrict what you can do physically, such as making you keep one hand on the table or making you talk like a pirate.&#10;&#10;The other notable mechanism in the game includes personal trivia, duels, and mini events called &quot;switch-a-roos&quot;. When trivia rules are in play, you get to test another player's knowledge of you. If they answer a question wrong, they draw a card &mdash; but at least they learned something about you! Duels are just as they sound &mdash; thumb wars, staring contests and more &mdash; but while you duel someone, play continues. The winner of a duel brags, the loser draws more cards. Switch-a-roos change the playing field, causing people to swap hands, trade seats, or reverse the order of play.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In the trick-taking card game ebbes, players need to keep on their toes each round as how they're going to score (or lose!) points might not be determined until the round is well underway.&#10;&#10;The deck in ebbes contains five colors of cards, and with three, four or five players, you use cards 1-6, 1-8 or 1-10. (Thus, each player is always dealt 10 cards.) In addition to the deck, you play with five number-designation cards (numbered 1-5), five color-designation cards that match the card colors, and a player aide board.&#10;&#10;Game play follows the pattern of traditional trick-taking games. The lead player for a trick plays one card, and the other players must follow suit if possible, while throwing any other card if they can't. The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless one or more trump cards were played, in which case the highest trump card wins the trick &mdash; but at the start of the round, trump is undetermined! To back up a step, at the start of the round, the first player reveals the top number-designation card; the numeral on that card helps determine trump as well as which cards earn or cost players points. If the number-designation card shows &quot;7&quot;, for example, then the color of the first 7 played determines the trump color for the round; use a color-designation card to mark the trump color on the player aide. What's more:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The second 7 determines which color is worth positive points; each card of this color is worth 1 point at the round's end.&#10;    The third 7 determines which the &quot;ebbes&quot; color &mdash; &quot;ebbes&quot; meaning &quot;something&quot; in Palatine; at round's end, the player(s) who don't have the most or fewest cards of this color each earn 3 points.&#10;    The fourth 7 determines which color is worth negative points; each card of this color is worth -1 point at the round's end.&#10;&#10;&#10;After four colors have been determined, the fifth color is automatically the &quot;nix&quot; color. Whoever has the most of these cards chooses the start player for the next round - after cards have been dealt for that round. At the start of the new round, reveal a new number-designation card. After all of the number-designation cards have been played &mdash; that is, after the fifth round &mdash; the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Two variants are included with ebbes. The first variant extends the game (and probably lengthens the &quot;determining&quot; time) by adding more cards to the deck. In the second variant, players take turns placing a color-designation card on the number-designation card of their choice, and those five particular cards determine the colors for trump, positive points, etc. as each of them is played. The game's website gives rules for a third variant in which each player discards one card at the start of the round, and the player in last place gets to look at these cards; whoever takes the final trick takes these cards prior to scoring.&#10;&#10;",

The core of the game consists of 3D landscapes that you build with large wooden blocks, after which you try to maneuver a large wooden pawn (&quot;the trapper&quot;) over this course.&#10;&#10;In competitive play, you want to be the first to reach the mountain summit on the score track (&quot;the route map&quot;), and to do so you must master several challenges. Each challenge consists of a parcours built out of the wooden blocks according to the challenge card you draw randomly from three piles: A - C, from easy to difficult. After having built the landscape course, you have to push, pull, lift, slide or swing the &quot;trapper&quot; from the start to the end block. This trapper has a metal eye on top, and you move it with a wooden rod with a hook at its end. Some challenges require an intermediate string between rod and pawn, while others require both hands to simultaneously move pawn and grizzly bear, the bear being another wooden piece. A third kind of piece to be moved is provisions, which you &quot;kick&quot; with the trapper.&#10;&#10;When you master the challenge, the next player decides whether to change to the next parcours or try to master the same one again. Depending on the difficulty of the challenge, your piece can move 2-4 steps toward the summit. If you lose track, fall down, or lose your provisions, you have lost this challenge and must move backward! The game includes other details &ndash; e.g., owls and squirrel tokens for managing your skills and special actions &ndash; but this is more or less the whole game.&#10;&#10;",

Each card also has six edges, and these edges connect adjacent cards in the hex-shaped playing area.&#10;&#10;The cards in the playing area start face down, with each player controlling a card(their Home) on a corner of this area. Each player has two transport ships in the center of his Home card and a cruiser on an edge. Cruisers are used to patrol sectors of space and destroy opposing transports, while transports let you activate sectors that you enter.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player adds a card to the Impulse from his hand, then (optionally) performs an action for a tech in his playing area, then (optionally) performs all the actions in the Impulse, then draws two cards and adds them to his hand. The Impulse is a line of cards shared by all players that changes turn by turn as players add cards to it and as cards fall off once it reaches maximum size. Thus, players need to feed the Impulse with actions that benefit them more than opponents, but that's easier said than done.&#10;&#10;When you perform actions &ndash; whether from moving transports to them or using the Impulse &ndash; you can boost them by having minerals of the same color or lots of transports. Each action has a single numeral on it, e.g., &quot;Command [1] ship for one jump&quot; or &quot;Build [1] cruiser at home&quot;; when you boost an action, you increase that numeral.&#10;&#10;Players score points by destroying enemy ships (one point per ship), by controlling edge spaces on the central card (one point per edge), and by taking other actions via cards.

        "description": "In The Builders: Middle Ages, the cards represent buildings or workers. Players score points (and gain money) by completing the construction of buildings, while placing a worker on a construction site costs money. Each building has four characteristics (carpentry, masonry, architecture, tilery) rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 10 ecu and an apprentice. Five workers and five buildings are placed face-up on the table, with the others set aside in separate decks. On a turn, you can take three free actions, then pay 5 ecu for each additional action. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Open a site - Take one of the five buildings, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.&#10;    Recruit a worker - Take one of the five workers, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.&#10;    Assign a worker to a building - Pay the cost of the worker (as he won't work for free!), then place him on a building; when the building's needs are met, you earn the points and coins indicated, then flip the building over. The workers return to your pool of available labor.&#10;    Get money - Forgo one, two or three actions to earn 1, 3 or 6 ecu.&#10;&#10;&#10;Some completed buildings join your labor pool as they can be used to complete other buildings. As soon as a player reaches 17 points, players finish the round so that everyone has the same number of turns, then you tally points, with each completed card having a point value and each 10 ecu being worth 1 point. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, you and your opponents are vying to employ the best talent while putting on the most magnificent show each month. While touring the country by train, you will have the opportunity to perform while adding talent to your show through hiring the performers stranded in cities by defunct circuses. Just remember to keep an eye on your wages, because your talent definitely will.&#10;&#10;Through clever card hand management, you control the movement of your train around the American northeast, making strategic business decisions about talent, performances and payroll in this fast-paced strategy game. Each turn represents one week of real time, and after six months, the circus season closes for the year and the game ends with one player declared as having The Greatest Show on Earth.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Sara Gruen&rsquo;s novel, Water for Elephants, Circus Train Second Edition includes thematic elements such as improving your show&rsquo;s reputation by picking up alcohol for your talent and staff (legally, in Canada), the high costs of supplying big cats and elephants, and the ability to &ldquo;red light&rdquo; (firing by throwing off the train) disgruntled talent or talent that has simply become too expensive to maintain. These elements are blended into the game&rsquo;s mechanics, keeping it all simple while adding layers of depth and strategy.&#10;&#10;What's New in 2nd Edition:&#10;&#10;This new edition combines the first edition with its first expansion.

        "name": "Last Chance for Victory",
        "description": "(from MMP website:)&#10;&#10;Last Chance for Victory is the next entry in The Gamers&rsquo; Line of Battle series (LoB) which simulates the Battle of Gettysburg. It is the second game in the series, following the well received None But Heroes about the Battle of Antietam.&#10;&#10;The story of Gettysburg is well known or, I should say, the popular rendition of the battle is well known and has certainly been simulated multiple times.&#10;&#10;As is usually the case with stripped down, accepted versions of complex events, this narrative misses much flavor and a deeper understanding of what went on. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;auto-tour&rsquo; version of a much more involved event.&#10;&#10;Many things are simply not brought out, or put into proper context, in the affirmed version of the battle:&#10;&#10;1)     Lee arrived on the field and tried to get his footing when Ewell (on his own initiative) ordered Rodes and Early to attack. Lee wasted no time in ordering Hill to attack with Heth and Pender to support Ewell&rsquo;s Corps. In the commonly held view, Lee arrived and simply dithered while events unfolded outside his control.&#10;&#10;2)    There were several opportunities that afternoon and evening to advance and take Cemetery and/or Culp&rsquo;s Hills. These were missed&hellip; but not, as commonly assumed, because one or more leaders were staring at their navels confused or indecisive. What happened and why?&#10;&#10;3)    Ewell made a clear headed decision his men were in no condition to take the hill that evening. He was the commander on the spot. Since then historians and armchair generals everywhere have questioned that decision, the game allows you to see who was right. Ewell was of the opinion that he could only do it if 3rd Corps supported him. That support was ordered by Lee (using 3rd Corps&rsquo; artillery) but was not implemented by the army&rsquo;s chief of artillery. Would that have allowed the attack to work? What was the relative condition of the Union defenders and the potential attacking troops anyway?&#10;&#10;4)    There never was any sort of &lsquo;dawn attack&rsquo; order, but there were orders to attack much earlier on the second day than actually occurred. The game allows you to find out what went wrong (so you can draw your own conclusions as to who to blame).&#10;&#10;5)    By evening of the 2nd day, the fate of Cemetery Ridge rested in the hands of a handful of formed Union regiments (including the human sacrifice of the 1st Minnisota). Confederate victory was very, very close&mdash;teetering in the balance much more than normally assumed. There was a reason Lee said that if Dorsey Pender remained in command for another 30 minutes, the Confederates would have won the battle. See just how tough the Union job was and how close to the edge they got. What would have been the result of that 2nd day&rsquo;s attack had it launched just a few hours earlier or even at the same time, but with the coordinated use of Anderson&rsquo;s and Pender&rsquo;s divisions?&#10;&#10;6)    Everyone assumes Pickett&rsquo;s Charge was a forlorn, desperate, throw of the dice, but what was the condition of many of the Union units manning that ridge? Was this attack a complete reworking of the Confederate battle plan out of blind frustration or was it a continuation of the plan from both earlier days? What was the earlier, theoretically coordinated, plan the attack was ad libbed from?&#10;&#10;7)    As a whole, the popular version of the battle pretty much assumes a Union victory unless multiple stars aligned for the Confederates. If this is so, did the Army of the Potomac have to merely put out a &lsquo;fair-to-middl&rsquo;in&rsquo; effort or did they have to fight tooth and nail to gain victory? If the latter, just how close of a run was it? Doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;assuming they will win&rdquo; take away well earned credit they had for finally overcoming a determined and usually successful foe?&#10;&#10;Last Chance for Victory attempts to allow players to find their own answers to these questions and points as well as many others. The added depth and nuance makes for a very different and, in my opinion, more accurate rendition of the battle than you&rsquo;ve ever seen before.&#10;&#10;Aside from showing the history in a way that will be both entertaining but make you thirst for more and better reading on the topic, multiple variations are provided to explore the battle. Sure, there are the usual &ldquo;extra troops&rdquo; variants, but more importantly, options that allow players to tweak the various historical behavior &lsquo;knobs&rsquo; I assigned. If you think my &lsquo;setting&rsquo; for Howard (to pull a name out of a hat) are all wet, you can change him to be better (or worse) so you can see how your version &lsquo;plays.&rsquo; Likewise, a number of rules simulate activities that were pretty much out of the player&rsquo;s hands (such as Buford&rsquo;s need to screen the town yet keep his losses very low), these can be &lsquo;turned off&rsquo; as desired to see what effect they really have on the battle. There is a matrix of the various &lsquo;control&rsquo; rules and the possible &lsquo;settings&rsquo; for each one that players can use before starting if they disagree with my decisions. The results of your choices might surprise you and spur your understanding of the battle to new levels.&#10;&#10;As with None But Heroes, Last Chance for Victory is designed to bring all of this and much more to your table in the most historically accurate and informational jam-packed game possible. Like any LoB game, it was designed with twin goals: the most insight possible and a game with maximum playability.&#10;&#10;Enhancing the already well received and streamlined Line of Battle rules, Last Chance for Victory comes with the v2.0 series rules. These rules incorporate the refinements and suggestions of hundreds of real players which make this smooth system even faster to play. Make no mistake, this is the only regimental level Gettysburg game that can be played to completion at a respectable clip&mdash;yet it is a large game. A pair of reasonably fast players could play the campaign game to completion at a convention like ConsimExpo. I&rsquo;ve completed campaign games with three players in a week of rather relaxed play time.&#10;&#10;Scenarios abound of various sizes. The campaign uses a 4-map &lsquo;box&rsquo; layout, but the game comes with two additional maps, one covering just the 1st Day&rsquo;s fighting and the other the 2nd and 3rd Day&rsquo;s. The big game scenarios can be played on one or both of those maps and, with those two linked together, it is possible to play the entire battle on 2 maps.&#10;&#10;It replaces This Hallowed Ground from the RSS-series.&#10;&#10;",

Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&#10;&#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&#10;- earn 2 coins&#10;- take 2 temporary workers&#10;- jump ahead in turn order&#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&#10;&#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;",

The adventurers collect equipment, interact and utilize their environment, fight monsters, and immerse themselves in the rich narrative elements.&#10;&#10;The complete story is broken down into different scenarios that represent a self-contained game. All of these scenarios contain chapters, each with its own narration and specifics. The objective of the game is to progress through the tale and face the endgame at the finale of each scenario.&#10;&#10;The main goal behind Machina Arcana is to provide players with a chilling game that can never be played the same way, mechanisms that enable varying strategies and approaches, and an extensive framework that combines everything smoothly. The game scales by default; there is no need for special conditions based on the player count. As the story progresses, so does your gear. But beware!

New Zealand and Australia were the first to issue the challenge, but soon after Scotland, South Africa, and the United States joined in. Then Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, and even Brazil intervened. England proudly refused to be forced into this dispute and proposed a worldwide racing championship be held in the Suffolk countryside in order to establish who were the world's supreme sheep farmers. Thus, the sheep race became an incredible and fascinating reality...&#10;&#10;In The Sheep Race, players must place bets on three races, with six sheep participating in each race. Each sheep starts with a number of &quot;breath&quot; cubes (in three colors) on it, along with numbers for three speeds of movement: trot, walk, and gallop.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he rolls the two dice &ndash; one a normal d6 and the other having values 0-0-0-1-2-3 &ndash; then moves the sheep in the appropriate lane, with a 7 or 8 moving the sheep in the outer two lanes and a 9 moving the lazy sheep at the back of the pack. When you move a sheep, you choose one of the three types of movement, advance the sheep the indicated number of spaces, and remove the appropriate breath cubes required &ndash; or you make the sheep rest so that it recovers two blue breath cubes.&#10;&#10;If a sheep hits the &quot;end zone&quot; &ndash; the final five spaces of a lane &ndash; with no cubes on it, then the sheep is exhausted and can't move or rest again. The race ends when three sheep reach the finish line or when all the sheep are exhausted. The first three positions pay off for those who bet on them, even if one or more of those positions contains an exhausted sheep.&#10;&#10;Players place three bets in the first two races (two secret and one visible) and two bets in the final race (both secret). Whoever collects the most in bets wins!&#10;&#10;With the advanced rules, players choose which sheep to move each time and the game lasts only one race, with players betting on the final order of all the sheep. Sheep sometimes get blocked and can move again only when passed by the flock leader.&#10;&#10;",

The game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic, tactical card battles, with the armies in this set particularly focused towards cavalry and ranged combat.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn. Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Elves and the Lizardmen. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Elf faction is based around strong cavalry units and archers, but has a relatively weak infantry. The Lizardmen army is the most flexible Lords of War army released so far and is best used to disrupt and counter enemy attack strategies.&#10;&#10;Elves versus Lizardmen is compatible with Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.&#10;&#10;",

If when laying out the cards in the grid, the dealer reveals the back of a bonus round card when at least ten cards are on the table, everyone prepares for the bonus round. The dealer reveals this card, which shows two card elements such as upraised arm and goggles, and everyone races to yell out how many cards in the grid feature these two elements. Whoever yells out the correct answer first receives the bonus round card, which is worth 2 points; whoever yells out the wrong answer takes a -2 point penalty card.

A stack of 36 tiles &ndash; with tiles arranged by decades: the six from 2030 on the bottom, then the five from 2020, and so on to the five from 1970 &ndash; is set up during the playing area.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top tile from the stack, then everyone resolves the symbol highlighted on the tile:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Energy &ndash; for a positive value, earn money; for a negative value, lose money or increase your pollution&#10;    Ecology &ndash; remove or add discs to your pollution track&#10;    Capital &ndash; earn money for each capital symbol on the tiles you own&#10;    Research &ndash; advance one research marker one space for each research symbol on tiles you own&#10;    Prosperity &ndash; score points for each prosperity symbol on tiles you own, but only if your pollution isn't maxed out&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has done this, the active player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take money.&#10;    Remove one pollution marker.&#10;    Move forward one space on one research track.&#10;    Buy a tile, with the amount owed being based on whether the tile is energy or ecology and the level of your corresponding research marker. If you buy a tile of the same level, the cost is &euro;100; if the tile is of a higher level, you pay &euro;100, plus &euro;100 for each level; and if the tile is lower, you pay a flat &euro;50.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players have limited space for tiles on their individual boards, especially since the tiles and spaces are color-coded, but players can cover existing tiles, if desired, losing any benefits (or penalties) in the process. Some parts of the individual board are off-limits to new infrastructure until you first provide transport; toll roads, highways and even train systems have drawbacks of their own, but ideally you'll be able to build your way past those trouble spots without causing too much pollution.&#10;&#10;When the final tile is drawn, that player finishes his turn, then everyone scores: twice for their energy and ecology levels, one for capital (with money being converted into prosperity points), once for research on both tracks (with points for those researching the most), and once for prosperity. Whoever tallies the most prosperity points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Players take the role of robots that awaken after an upgrade to find their three laws replaced with nonsensical directives such as &quot;Explore Breathing&quot; or &quot;Improvise Science&quot;. Players race to complete objectives based on these directives, the first player to complete all three directives wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game opens with players drafting directives, providing them with a partial knowledge of each others' objectives. Each turn the ship encounters an obstacle, such as a meteor or enemy ship. Once that's been revealed the (relatively helpless) human crew make a quick reaction. Then the bulk of the turn is spent by the players choosing actions for their robots to take in service to their directives, before finally the event is resolved if it has not been neutralized in some way. The game ends once a player completes all three directives or the ship has encountered ten events.&#10;&#10;The actions are general (move right, move left, turn on the machine in this room) and the directives might specify interactions with any part of the game (events, items, crew, machines, other robots). The wellbeing of the ship or its crew has no special place in the victory conditions, the state of the ship at the end of a game where a robot has to &quot;Empower Technology&quot; (repair at least two damaged machines) might differ from one in which a robot is trying to &quot;Improvise War&quot; (fire a living crewman and hit an enemy ship).&#10;&#10;",

The price for this effort would be a memorial on the main square of the town, eternal glory, and the satisfaction from a job well done.&#10;&#10;Years passed before the candidates finally reached the city. The mayor had never been happier, but he didn't know which of the entrepreneurs would be most suitable for the position, so he decided to give each of them a chance to prove that he was the long-awaited entrepreneur. Each of the candidates received five helpers who were admittedly not very bright, but who were certainly loyal and obedient. They have three years to prove their craftsmanship and skill, and after this time, the mayor will decide which candidate most deserves the honorable position.&#10;&#10;In Craftsmen, players try to gain appreciation points by building production buildings, creating connections between these buildings, producing raw materials and consumption goods, or buying them outright. They can also gain points by sending produced goods to the farthest parts of the world. In the end, whoever has the most appreciation points wins.&#10;&#10;",

As they tell their story, they play a card, and if they can link multiple cards from their hand together, they receive a bonus of some sort usable later in the defeat of the Great Old One (or his ascension if the player turns out to be a cultist).  If something is mentioned and another player has a card matching what is mentioned, he takes over the story and uses his cards at that point.&#10;&#10;The objective is to tell a great story and then reach the climactic fight between the investigators and the Great Old One which is told in story-format as well.&#10;&#10;Cthulhu's Vault is co-designed by Richard Launius and Jim Dietz.

        "name": "Three Kingdoms Redux",
        "description": "The Han Dynasty, founded in 206 BC, ruled the central plains and much of modern day China for nearly four hundred years. However, by late second century, court politics and poor governance has left it in rapid decline. The government was dominated by corrupt eunuchs and officials who levied heavy taxes on the peasants, resulting in public discontent. This culminated in the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao in 184 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling (168-189 AD).&#10;&#10;Although the Yellow Turban Rebellion was eventually put down, many surviving followers went on to become bandits and continued to create problems for the government. The Han army was unable to control the bandits and Emperor Ling granted direct administrative power over provinces and command of regional military to local lords. Many feudal lords took the opportunity to sever ties with the Han government and ruled independently. The more ambitious lords annexed neighboring territories to expand their power bases. This led to the emergence of the three power blocs of Wei, Wu and Shu, and ushered in the Three Kingdoms period.&#10;&#10;Three Kingdoms Redux is a board game that seeks to recreate the tripartite between the states of Wei, Wu and Shu. You assume the role of one of the three lords &ndash; Cao Cao leading Cao Wei, Sun Jian leading Eastern Wu or Liu Bei leading Shu Han. Players start the game from asymmetrical positions, reflecting the manpower advantages Wei enjoyed in the early part of the period. The weaker states of Wu and Shu protect themselves by forming an alliance. As a feudal lord, you manage the different aspects of running a state whilst guarding your borders against both rebellious border tribes and external enemies. Managing each aspect well earns victory points for your state. But beware, for the balance of power shifts constantly during the game. Understand and take advantage of the power shifts, and you will fulfill your grand ambition of re-unifying China!&#10;&#10;In more detail, Three Kingdoms Redux is played over a number of rounds, up to a maximum of twelve. Players bid for various actions with their general tokens. The highest bidder of each action space obtains the right to carry out the actions.&#10;&#10;These actions allow players to improve your state&rsquo;s domestic development, gain military strength, construct state enhancements, increase popularity with your people, improve relationships with border tribes and gain promotion for the lord, to the next higher rank.&#10;&#10;The actions available to each player are: &#10;&#10;     develop your state&rsquo;s farm or marketplace, &#10;     recruit or train army units, &#10;     produce weapons, &#10;     trade resources, &#10;     construct state enhancements,  &#10;     control the Han emperor, &#10;     demand tributes from your vassals, &#10;     win support from your people, &#10;     import technology, &#10;     improve your relationship with your border tribe, or &#10;     wage battle against other states to expand your borders.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",
