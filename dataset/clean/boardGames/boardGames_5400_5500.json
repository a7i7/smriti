        "description": "Darjeeling has two main board areas.  The first is an array of squares representing one, two or three half-crates of tea in four different varieties (colors).  Each player has a marker which moves about in the array, picking up tea at the rate of one square per turn.  There are simple rules governing movement in this array and the players compete for the desirable squares.&#10;&#10;Eventually, several times per game, each player has enough squares of a single color to fit them together so that the half-crates all make whole crates.  Now he can make a tea shipment.  This pays off in victory points in three different ways.  First, there is a &quot;demand&quot; award of up to 6 VP depending on how long it has been since anyone shipped this variety.  Second, if the shipment was of at least four crates, there is a flat bonus of 1 VP per crate.&#10;&#10;Third and most pivotally, there are VP that will be awarded at the beginning of the player's next and subsequent turns.  Each tea shipment is represented with cubes of the player's color (not the tea variety color) on a sort of barge.  The new shipment of tea is always placed, in the other of the two main board areas, at the top of a column of all the recent shipments (the number of total shipments varying with the number of players in the game), so that as more shipments are made, the old shipments drift farther down the column and eventually out of play.  At the beginning of your turn, you look to see where your shipments are in this column, and they pay out VP with better multipliers the higher they still are in the column.  This constitutes the driving force of the game, as nobody else wants to see your shipment at the top of the column for several turns in a row.  Players thus have an incentive to make a shipment even if they haven't yet assembled a large number of crates.&#10;&#10;It's a race to 100 points.  A runaway leader can easily take over if the rest of the table is not vigilant, so the best games of Darjeeling are those among vigilant players.&#10;&#10;",

It is felt that with their combined skills and variety of individual experience, they will be able to solve the problems presented. The players try to reconstruct the crime by asking, guessing and fiddling about.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=======&#10;&#10;How would it be if we formed a Club? What is today ? Tuesday? We will call it The Tuesday Night Club. It is to meet every week, and each member in turn has to propound a problem. Some mystery of which they have personal knowledge, and to which, of course, they know the answer. Let me see, how many are we? One, two, three, four, five. We ought really to be six... (Joyce Lempri&eacute;re)&#10;&#10;From this conversation in Agatha Christie&rsquo;s book &lsquo;The Tuesday Club Murders&rsquo;, a series of great detective stories come up, where perceptive characters rival Miss Marple, who teachs them a real lesson of shrewdness, explaining with talent and with all kind of misteries, no matter how strange or complicated they may be.&#10;&#10;This game is exactly that: a narrative game based on the classic detective stories. A group of five players cooperate and compete to solve a mistery proposed by a sixth player, known as the host, trying to emulate Sherlock Holmes himself, from Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s books. Host and players find themselves entwined in a complicated game of cat and mouse, where the first one propose a mysterious enigma and the others must solve it by racking their brains. For a length of an hour, as that is the time limit to solve the mistery, an intense (intellectual) battle is fought, where the host challenges the rest of the members of the Tuesday Club to find a solution that almost never is near or within reach. The armchair detectives will have to use in a creative way the clich&eacute;s with which their dramatic characters have been defined, and they will have to make the appropriate questions in order to find the solution.&#10;&#10;Therefore, this is a game that puts the perceptiveness, intuition, and above all the logical and deductive intelligence of the participants to test. The constant interactivity among the players, the creation of intelligent questions with shrewdness, wit and creativity, and the dynamism of the intrigue make &lsquo;El Club de los Martes&rsquo; a perfect game to spend an hour of fun with family or friends.&#10;&#10;El Club de los Martes is many games in one.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=======&#10;&#10;A narrative game of deduction and logic. All players are armchair detectives meeting every Tuesday to engage on some crime solving. A host presents the case and in turns each player can ask questions and use his or her special abilities to gather more information. Asking questions and gathering information cost money -every player starts the game with 15 pounds - paid to a common pool. Proposing a solution is very expensive and other players may benefit economically from you failures. Only one player may win, but the solution relies on the information gathered by the whole group with certain cooperatives aspects. If no detective solves the crime after one hour, nobody wins. The player with the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; token has the advantage because she starts every round; but if that player passes, she loses the token that goes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Based in novel &quot;The Tuesday Club Murders&quot; by Agatha Christie.&#10;&#10;Rules one are available in Spanish language.&#10;&#10;",

Once two dancers meet in the heat of the night they can be made into couples and the better the match the more players score. If only two of the four visible qualities match then the dancers have a one-night-stand which is not a very long term fun and is thus worth only one point. With three matching qualities the dancers actually like one another, start dating and that is worth four points. If all the four visible qualities match then the dancers get the &quot;happily ever after&quot; the one true love we all search for and thus it is worth full 5 points.&#10;&#10;Each dancer also has a secret quality that can and will alter the basic score. For example if a guy has a large... &quot;personality&quot; then the player gets two extra points unless the other dancer is drunk, because if she is she wouldn't notice the difference. Girl's beautiful roommate on the other hand only has a function in the one-night-stands and the fun the couple would have means now triple fun and thus the player gets triple points. There are 12 different secret qualities in the game ranging from heart-broken to those who still live with their mom.&#10;&#10;Occasionally the game gets spiced up by one of the three special charachters in the game.

During a turn a player uses the Alethiometer spindle: the spinning action reveals the two actions the player is allowed to choose from. A typical move involves playing or drawing Lyra cards, played in sets to collect Item tiles from the board (representing Lyra and Pan's actions and investigations) or placing Symbol tokens that will later let a player draw valuable Truth tokens (representing the interpretation of the Alethiometer).

When the yard deck runs out, the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

During stock rounds, shares in the various railroading companies are bought &amp; sold by players and are tracked on the stock market mat. During operating rounds, the player/directors of those railroading companies are allowed to build track &amp; place station markers on the map, and then may buy trains from which to earn capital from running those trains along routes on the map. The capital earned may be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained by the company for future expansion.&#10;&#10;The game ends at a pre-determined point, whereupon the player with the most worth,(cash on hand &amp; share certificate value) wins.&#10;&#10;As with many games in this series, there are similarities within the rules, but many feature slight differences, and it is these that give each individual 18xx game its character.&#10;&#10;1848 features an interesting array of differences described above. These include how private companies are purchased, the inclusion of The Bank Of England as a public company that extends loans and administers railroads that are in receivership, dealing with different track gauges between states and 'The Ghan' special train.&#10;&#10;",

The battlefield is a cityscape (poster map) with building models integral to the game's strategy and gameplay. The game uses dice pools of custom dice that are used for both attacking and taking actions, leading to an ebb and flow between monster and unit turns. The goal for both players is to eliminate the monster on the opposing side.&#10;&#10;Monsterpocalypse launched as a CMG in Fall 2008 with the 'Rise' block which consisted of a base set ('Rise') and two expansion sets ('I Chomp NY' and 'All Your Base'), both of which were released in 2009. The second block was released in Fall 2009 with the base set ('Now') and an expansion set ('Big in Japan') in 2010. The last expansion for the 'Now' block has still not been released as of 2015.&#10;&#10;Each set contains large-scale monsters, as well as smaller support units and interactive buildings. Figures were sold in semi-randomized starter packs and randomized booster packs, with limited figures available only through promotional events.&#10;&#10;In 2010 Privateer Press released the Monsterpocalypse 2 Player Battle Box, a semi-randomised set which contained everything 2 players needed to dive right into the game, including two full factions and a complete set of buildings (all from Set 1 'Rise'). In 2011 they also released Monsterpocalypse Dangerous Monster Zone or Monsterpocalypse DMZ for short. These worked as expansion packs for the 2 Player Battle Box, each containing completely fixed, faction specific sets of Set 2 'I Chomp NY' and 3 'All Your Base' miniatures. By buying the DMZs for the factions you got in your  initial battle box you would have 2 complete factions and a full set of buildings from the 'Rise' block, making Monsterpocalypse  much more accessible for newer players in a more non-collectible format.&#10;&#10;",

Once the cards have been shuffled, the scorekeeper deals 3 cards face down to each player, along with an equal number of white dice, called a stash. The scorekeeper places the remaining cards face down off to one side of the table to form a deck.&#10;&#10;The scorekeeper begins the game by rolling two dice (1 black &amp; 1 white) in the center of the table. If no one scores, play rotates clockwise to the next player who rolls two dice. Any two die, including the black die can be rolled (see below). Before each roll players examine their cards to see what dice combinations will be needed to match a card in their hand.&#10;&#10;Two white dice from your stash, or. &#10;One die from your stash, and one (previously rolled) die from the table, or&#10;Two (previously rolled) dice from the table.&#10;&#10;Player&rsquo;s take turns rolling until someone shouts STRUT! indicating a player believes they have won the round. A round is won when you match a card in your hand with a dice combination on the table. Let&rsquo;s say you have a 4 of a Kind (card) in your hand. There are 8 dice on the table 1,3,4,6 and four 5&rsquo;s: 5, 5, 5. You quickly shout Strut! believing your dice combination (four 5&rsquo;s) matches the card (4 of a Kind) in your hand, thus winning the round. But have you? You have if one of your 5&rsquo;s is the black die. The black die must always be part of the score.&#10;&#10;Keeping score is very simple. All dice on the table are scored. The black die counts face value [1]=1 point, [2]= 2 points [3]=3 points, etc. White dice count 1 point each. In the example above, you scored a total of 12 points (5 points for the black die and 7 points for the white dice.)&#10;&#10;After each round the winner&rsquo;s points are totaled by the scorekeeper. After the scorekeeper has recorded the points, the winner discards his/her winning card, placing it &ldquo;face up&rdquo; under the deck. If the winner&rsquo;s accumulated score totals less than 30 points then he/she must draw one new card from the deck. If the winner has accumulated 30 or more points, no card is drawn allowing that player to begin ridding his/her hand of cards in an attempt to win the game. (Re-Action cards are an exception to the &ldquo;30 points&rdquo; rule.) All other players keep their cards. Dice on the table are evenly redistributed. Note: As you will see as the game progresses, tactics and strategies become a big part of each round.&#10;&#10;The winner begins the next round by rolling 1 black and 1 white die. Play continues until someone shouts Strut! The first player to accumulate 30 or more points with no cards remaining in their hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Black Rooster&#10;&#10;If an opponent throws the Black Rooster card down on your winning card, it spells disaster! You must turn in all the cards in your hand, and draw 3 replacements. Plus, you lose all your accumulated points.&#10;&#10;",

Numerous scenarios are included to play out various smaller battles in Normandy. It is intended for two players or player teams.&#10;&#10;The game uses a unique sequence of play and a system of fire combat throughout the airdrop and beach assault phases with company-level breakdown units, then a more traditional odds-type combat approach throughout the rest of the game. Initial beach defense deployments at start and daily air support and defense allocations, hidden to the opposing player; create a level of uncertainty that makes for a tense, challenging duel.&#10;&#10;The game combines a detailed, extensively researched order of battle with relatively fast-playing game mechanics to make it not only the largest representation of the Normandy campaign available to date, but a manageable one that is meant to be played, not shelved. Scenarios include &lsquo;Bloody Omaha&rsquo;, &lsquo;Operation Epsom&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cobra&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Fight for Cherbourg&rsquo; and more.&#10;&#10;A future expansion will extend the play area south, to include the Mortain and Falaise scenarios, and extend the campaign to late August and the 3rd Army breakout.&#10;&#10;Game Equipment: &#10;&#10;     One Rule Book &#10;     One Scenario Book &#10;     Five (5) 22x34&rdquo; full color Maps &#10;     Nine (9) full color counter sheets &#10;     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Allied Air Allocation Log (laminated) &#10;     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Axis AAA Allocation Log (laminated) &#10;     11x17&rdquo; Turn Record Track &#10;     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Terrain Effects Chart (x2) &#10;     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Repl/Recon/Weather chart (x2) &#10;     8-1/2x11&rdquo; German Record Track &#10;     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Allied Record Track &#10;     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Combat Results Table (x2) &#10;     Dice - 3d6 and 1d10 &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Germany's 17th Army and 1st Panzer Army steamrolled over all opposition until they reached the mountains. There the Russians slowed and then stopped the Germans at the outskirts of Novorossisk, on the road to Tuapse and along the Terek River. This infuriated Hitler who then took over personal command of Army Group A and poured replacements and reinforcements into the area that were badly needed at Stalingrad. Eventually 27 Axis divisions were fighting south of the Don.&#10;&#10;The Axis forces include 2 mountain divisions, 2 light (j&auml;ger) divisions, an SS motorized division (Wiking), and 3 panzer divisions -- two of which had three tank battalions while many on the east front have only one. The German army is accompanied by 1 Slovakian and 7 Romanian divisions.&#10;&#10;The ranks of the Soviet army in the Caucasus is filled with Armenians, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Cossacks and Turkoman who have questionable loyalty.

The designer has added new pieces and scenarios to this edition of the game.&#10;&#10;This 2-player game recreates General Patton's attempt to seize the key city of Metz and to get across the Moselle River before the retreating Germans can form an effective defense.  The U.S. forces comprised of three divisions of the 20th Corps had just completed an epic pursuit across France after the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead.  The exhausted Allied forces were at the end of their supply line and has barely enough resources left for one last push. If they had been able to get across the Moselle River, they would have compromised the entire German Westwall defenses. This would have enabled Patton to make an attempt at crossing the Rhine before the end of 1944 and might have ended the war months earlier.  The defending German forces, four divisions of the 82nd Corps of the German 1st Army, were a combination of hastily collected and organized units, including fresh units from the German interior and remnants of units that Patton had been pursuing across France. The battle, which began on 7 September 1944 and lasted for about a week, was a singular opportunity that could have gone either way.

Complete a burrow of a particular color that is longer than the current shortest burrow in that color, and the gopher living there moves into the new one; it stays there until it gets lured away again by an even bigger burrow! There is one less gopher of each color than there are players, so not everyone will be able to host all three gopher types at once.&#10;&#10;Every once in a while the tour bus will arrive, and the tourists will be most excited to see the types of gophers promised to them by their tour schedule.

Th&#30;rough exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.&#10;&#10;&#31;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. Th&#31;e game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!&#10;&#10;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw.

Gentlemen of the Imperial court, ordinary clerks and functionaries by day, went out at night to meet their secret lovers in furtive trysts. Writing by the light of the moon, each tried to craft the finest and most moving poetry in the form of the Tanka, a short verse composed of only five lines. The best poems evoked the scene, the season, and represented the depth of the courtier's knowledge of the fashionable themes at court. By far, the most successful such lover was a fictional one named Hikaru Genji, the Shining Prince. Genji was, for the ladies of the court, the symbol of the perfect lover. For the men of the court, he was the perfect example to emulate. &#10;In GENJI, players take the roles of courtiers out to woo fair princesses. Players score points for writing the finest poetry, or winning the most hearts. But beware: other courtiers will be waiting in the wings to steal those hearts away! Take your brush in hand, and set out on the night streets of Kyoto. The romance of the height of the Heian Period awaits you in GENJI.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.zmangames.com/cardgames/genji.htm&#10;&#10;From BoardgameNews.com:&#10;&#10;&quot;Players in Genji try to learn from the historical figure of Genji and woo the ladies of the Imperial Court with their poetry. Twelve ladies, each bearing a symbol of one of the four seasons as well as one of three fashions &ndash; melancholy, nature, romance &ndash; are laid out in a circle, with a fashion card chosen at random to show players what type of poetry is in style.&#10;&#10;&quot;In each of the four seasons, each player will travel from his &ldquo;home&rdquo; &ndash; a lady chosen at the start of the game that bears his marker &ndash; around the circle in either direction. A player moves 1-3 spaces each turn, then either studies new material (discards poetry cards and draws new ones) or woos the lady he is currently visiting. If he has no rivals who have previously presented her with poems, he can present her with a poem on one or two cards. &ldquo;Each poem card has the top or the bottom of a classic Tanka poem (5 lines, 5,7,5,7,7 syllables each, respectively),&rdquo; says Kirk. &ldquo;A poem can be considered either a top, a bottom, or a match of the two cards.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&quot;If another player has already presented a poem, then he can either complete the poem (assuming only a single card was played) or challenge it (by playing a poem card that increases the beauty of the poem, thus revealing the other player for the poser he is). In the latter case, you discard your contribution and the matching half, then add the remaining half poem to your hand to be used later. &#10;...&#10;&quot;The round ends once a player returns home and makes a final study or woo action. Players then score points if they have the most poems on the board for that season, have presented the most beautiful poem of the season, or pitched woo at the home of another player.

In fact, he showed affection and appreciation to each son in descending order of their birth.  Over time, this greatly displeased his younger sons to the point of confrontation.  Being respectful to their father, the younger two sons did not accuse their father directly, but merely asked the question:  &quot;What more can I do to earn your respect?&quot;  At first the father was outraged that his younger sons would question his fidelity, but then he realized their defiance presented an opportunity.&#10;&#10;His land had been plagued by prankster Dragon that ate his crops, scared away his workers and generally caused chaos throughout his land.  He decided to put his younger sons to the test of ridding his land of this Dragon.  The sons agreed, but pleaded:  &quot;Should our older brothers be denied this opportunity to prove their devotion to you?&quot;  Knowing full well his sons' intent, Wei Fu agreed to send all five sons on the quest.  However, his older sons, fearful for their safety, begged for a reprieve.  Acquiescing, Wei Fu decided to ease the burden by declaring:  &quot;The Dragon is the quest!  However, I would still appreciate any son who brings me the finest examples of the Five Elements of Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal, which provide the very foundation of our world.&quot;  With this alternative quest, he would assign the easier tasks to his older sons&mdash;or so he thought.&#10;&#10;Weilong or &quot;Powerful Dragon&quot; is a simple dice game based loosely on the dice game One-O-Five and the Chinese card game Shou Ba Yi.  Each player represents the role of one of Wei Fu's sons on their quest to collect the Five Elements or capture the Dragon.  Each player rolls their dice and sets aside those dice showing their target number (Element).  The objective is to roll all five dice of the target number before any other player.  Target numbers are determined by drawing cards (Son Cards).   The Son Cards also have unique abilities for the players.&#10;&#10;Once a player has set aside all five dice of the target number or captured the Dragon (by collecting the dice 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), the remaining players add up the total of the dice they have collected along with the penalty number at the bottom of the card and track those points.  Your goal is have the lowest point total each round and for the game.  The Son cards are then passed to the left and the next round begins (5 Player Game).  The winner is the player who has the least amount of points after 5 rounds.&#10;&#10;",

Now The Boss is coming for an impromptu inspection, so you must race against your opponent to be the first to retrieve your Monkey and return it to your Loading Bay, before The Boss arrives!&#10;&#10;Monkey Dash is a two player strategy game, in which players spend action points to move their Supervisor and Monkey, and to manipulate the Banana Crates to build a pathway across the board.&#10;&#10;The game requires you to employ a wide range of tactics, constantly modify your plans to balance offensive and defensive play, based upon the actions of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Two variants ship with the game: Pure Skill, removes all luck from the game, and Advanced, introduces a new banana skin playing piece, adding a new twist to the game.&#10;&#10;Monkey Dash launched at the UK Games Expo 2009, where it received the public vote for Best New Strategy Game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Whoowasit?, players must find the magical ring that was stolen from the wise king by the evil wizard. Playing against a running clock, players move their playing pieces through the various rooms on the game board to uncover clues to who stole the precious gem. Along the way, talking animals help players solve the mystery of the stolen item with the help of a treasure chest that randomly supplies clues on behalf of the animals. Whenever players meet animals, they must feed them so the animals &mdash; that can only be understood by children &mdash; can provide the clues that advance gameplay. The clues supplied by the electronic treasure chest ensure that no two games are alike. All players must work together to find the stolen ring, and they win or lose as a group, depending on whether they can master an assigned task.&#10;&#10;Whoowasit? is the third electronic game by Reiner Knizia published by Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH.&#10;&#10;",

The green branches are made lighter for extra spring when the frogs land -- and when time is up. The lily pad-shaped catapults work really well -- so well, in fact, they'll fly too if you don't hold them down with a finger.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(from MMP's website :)&#10;&#10;Battle Above the Clouds is the 8th game in the award-winning Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (GCACW) series. This is the first game covering a western theater campaign and will serve as the core area for a series of maps covering the entire corridor from Nashville, Tennessee to Atlanta, Georgia. The game includes both the Chickamauga campaign of August/September, 1863 and the Chattanooga campaign of October/November of the same year.&#10;&#10;Battle Above the Clouds uses the same GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that were first published in MMP's Skirmisher magazine and Grant Takes Command. The game scale remains unchanged for the western campaigns, although two new terrain types (hills and ridges) have been added to properly represent the rugged terrain that dominates the Chattanooga area.&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;Battle Above the Clouds includes a wide variety of engagements in the Basic Game scenarios. The seven actions include two introductory scenarios, a cavalry raid, a fighting withdrawal, a series of operational maneuvers through mountainous terrain, and two large battles:&#10;    -McLemore&rsquo;s Cove (4 turns, September 10-13, 1863)&#10;    -Crossing Chickamauga Creek (1 turn, September 18, 1863)&#10;    -The Battle of Chickamauga (3 turns, September 18-20, 1863)&#10;    -Wheeler&rsquo;s Raid (8 turns, September 29-October 6, 1863)&#10;    -Opening the Cracker Line (1 turn, October 28, 1863)&#10;    -Lookout Mountain &amp; Missionary Ridge (2 turns, November 24-25, 1863)&#10;    -Ringgold Gap (2 turns, November 26-27, 1863)&#10;&#10;The two Advanced Game scenarios cover both major periods of campaigning in the region:&#10;    -The Chickamauga Campaign (32 turns, August 29- September 29, 1863)&#10;    -The Siege of Chattanooga (40 turns, October 28-December 6, 1863)&#10;&#10;The Advanced Game rule set has also been standardized so players will be able to quickly move to new campaigns in the series.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2000 yards / 1.15 mile&#10;Unit: Regiment to Division&#10;&#10;Battle Above the Clouds contains:&#10;    -GCACW Series Rules Booklet (approx 24 pgs)&#10;    -BATC Specific Rules Booklet (approx 48 pgs including scenarios/designer notes)&#10;    -Two 22&quot;x32&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;    -A full-color 11&quot;x17&quot; Off-Map Display&#10;    -Two full-color Force Displays&#10;    -Three Countersheets&#10;    -Two 4-page color Charts and Tables&#10;    -Two 6-sided Dice&#10;&#10;",

But that's not all: like all the best strategy games, players need to think several moves ahead in order both to maximize their scores and to frustrate their opponents.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of seven cards, all with different words on.  You play a card which is  placed next to cards in play to create compound words or phrases - as read down, or left to right.  The scores are the sum of the two cards - or more cards if in play.  You then draw a replacement card, keeping seven in hand.  The game ends when one player has played out their hand, or no player can play.  All remaining cards in hand are then deducted from the scores.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The tulip, a flower native to central Asia, created quite a ruckus upon reaching the shores of Europe in the mid-1500s. When a virus attacks a tulip, the resulting colour patterns can be stunning, but the same virus weakens the tulip and makes reproduction a challenge. These rare tulips have always been quite expensive, even to this day. Many associate Tulipmania with these rare, high-priced tulips, but scholars report that this first bubble market, where buyers pay far more than something is physically worth because of the resale value, actually stemmed from the common tulip market over December 1636 and January 1637.&#10;&#10;The Dutch, well-known for their trading prowess, were the centre of the tulip trade. During this time, the bubonic plague was killing off 1 out of every 7 people per year, so the common man saw little reason not to invest foolishly with a chance of making a substantial profit. These conditions created a situation where the prices of tulips skyrocketed by the day, until the prices hit a point that could not be sustained. The wily investors knew when to sell off, so those who profited most are those who sold just as the market started to turn sour.&#10;&#10;You are playing one of those wily investors. You have a network of buyers and colleagues, all of whom are also trying to become wealthy. Your goal is to make smart investments, artificially raise prices, fleece your network at the best time, and then make your escape from Tulipmania with the most money.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    JKLM Online (Real-Time and Turn-Based)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Omega Centauri",
        "description": "Two millennia ago, a loose federation of planets combined to form the Galactic Empire. From that small beginning, the Empire ruthlessly expanded, enslaving or exiling all races that were a threat to their dominion. Recently, the Empire has suffered revolts from conquered races, and on the barren galactic rim, the exiled races gather their forces to strike at the weakened Empire. As the Empire's might and influence wane, a new era is dawning. Which new race will ascend to power?&#10;&#10;Omega Centauri is a game of galactic empire building for 2 to 4 players. The play map is made up of sector tiles, and at the beginning of the game the majority of the map is Empire-controlled resource sectors. A variety of map layouts are included and the size of the map depends on the number of players. During each round of play, you have the opportunity to perform three of five possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Assemble (place your fleets into sectors with shipyards)&#10;     Build (build monuments, construct shipyards, and erect planetary defenses)&#10;     Move (move fleets into a sector or out of a sector)&#10;     Politics (gain resources or increase your fleet capacity)&#10;     Research (select an available technology)&#10;&#10;&#10;In the base game, players take turns each round selecting and executing one action at a time until each player has taken three actions, then a new round begins. The base game offers a compelling mix of strategic planning and tactical play, as players must balance their long term goals for development and for technology acquisition with the need to take advantage of the opportunities that arise during action selection.  The base game provides a streamlined 4x experience that can be completed in about an hour.&#10;&#10;The advanced game differs from the base game in several important respects. First, the advanced game introduces improved technologies, racial powers, and other elements to provide a more complex and flavorful gaming experience. It also requires players to select all three of their actions (and the order that they will be performed in) at the start of every round. Thus, to succeed, you must carefully plan your turn, anticipate your opponents' actions, and more successfully execute your overall strategy. Reserve Fleet Actions are added, giving an important boost and a use for spare fleets, through these (and spending valuable resources) players can take an extra action. Finally, through the Politics Action, the full game allows players to select goals that award victory points at the end of the game based upon how well the player has carried out a specific agenda. The full game provides an epic 4x experience in around two hours with variable powers, advanced technologies, and numerous paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, you will be compelled to make important decisions regarding how to advance your civilization: Will you focus on obtaining technological or cultural superiority, or will you build an invincible armada to crush those who stand in your way? The winner of the game will be the player who has accumulated the most victory points at the end of the final round of play. Omega Centauri offers players many routes to victory, and you can accumulate victory points (VPs) by wresting control of sectors of space from the Empire (or from other players), by improving your infrastructure and planetary defenses, or by expanding your cultural influence. The player with the most VPs at the end of the final round is deemed to have ascended and established the new dominant Empire in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;",

Panzer Grenadier: Elsenborn Ridge covers the fierce fighting on the &quot;north shoulder&quot; of the Battle of the Bulge between the American First Army and the German Sixth SS Panzer Army and Fifth Panzer Army. The heroic stand at St. Vith by 7th Armored Division, the &quot;panzer graveyard&quot; of Krinkelt, the destruction of 1st SS Panzer Division &mdash; it's all here, and more.&#10;&#10;Elsenborn Ridge is a stand-alone game in the Panzer Grenadier series: You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the 35 scenarios. These include fierce tank battles and infantry actions, including the failed drive of Jochen Peiper's battle group toward the Meuse River, 3rd Armored Division's destruction of 2nd SS Panzer Division, the American stand along Elsenborn Ridge and the collapse of the 106th Infantry Division.&#10;&#10;Pieces include American paratroopers, German Tiger II tanks, American P47 fighter-bombers, German &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; rocket launchers, and much more. Both German regular army and Waffen SS troops are present. There are four semi-rigid mapboards, created by artist Guy Riessen.&#10;&#10;The 2015 printing of Elsenborn Ridge sports a new cover, and includes the Panzer Grenadier Fourth Edition rules.&#10;&#10;",
