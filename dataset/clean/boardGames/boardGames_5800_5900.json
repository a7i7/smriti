Lovecraft's mythos.&#10;In this game, the players attempt to close all the gates to the other dimensions that have opened in Arkham city and thus preventing the Old One from entering our world. Players need to banish monsters and collect items in order to seal the eight gates before time on the doom-tracker runs out and the Great Old One awakens.&#10;&#10;The gameplay follows three steps in a fixed order: bringing new creatures in the game, the player actions and drawing an event card.&#10;The game can be won by succesfully by completing different goals: find out the active Great Old One, seal all eight gates and send a player with the right combination of items to the Great Old One to banish him.&#10;Losing the game cane be done in three different ways: the doom track runs out, the players fail to reveal the Great Old One in time or the players all go insane.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Step back to early 20th Century New England. Here, the horrible &quot;Great Old Ones&quot; mysterious inhabitants of a dark, unfathomable void-seek entry into our world. One of their imprisoned overlords gathers them, just as his worldly servants open portals throughout Arkham for the coming onslaught. Only Salem's master witch, Robert Craven, holds the key to safeguarding mankind. He plans to gather a team of intrepid scholars to find the hidden portals and close them with powerful magic seals. The noble witch's elite team must battle the threat of madness, duel the dark servants, tackle mystical challenges, and face their ultimate nemesis: an unidentified Great Old One with an unknown and incalculable strength.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Witch of Salem,&quot; you step into the terrifying world of renowned storyteller Wolfgang Hohlbein, a mythos inspired by the tales of H. P. Lovecraft. You play one of the witch's scholarly allies.

A player keeps the dice from their previous turn and may, if desired, add or subtract a die from these to accelerate or slow on their current turn.  Any or all dice used in the previous turn may be left at their current values or rerolled.  Once the roll is complete the player chooses a direction of travel, either straight or one hex side (60 degrees) to the left or right, and if the complete distance cannot be travelled the boat incurs damage.  Too much damage will sink your powerboat and penalise you for the next race.  The buoys change positions for each successive race and, after three races, players add up their points to determine the winner.  A scoring variant for two players is included in the rules.&#10;&#10;",

If you can't move, your opponent moves again immediately, moving the tower matching the color of the space occupied by the stymied tower.&#10;&#10;As the game unfolds, your towers will be promoted to &quot;Sumos&quot; and have the ability to push your opponent's pieces backwards, earning you extra turns.

Players take command of an army of the period, represented by their headquarters, and control their attached units, their men and equipment. The purpose is to re-create all the relevant factors of war at the operational level in the pre-industrial age.&#10;The game is played as a sequence of &ldquo;game turns&rdquo;, each made up of several actions performed by the forces of all sides present on the game board. The diverse scenarios that can be played have a limited number of game turns, once finished players check which side has won. Many of these scenarios can be played by just 2 players.

It was a complex war that involved diverse interests and troops from many nations. Great Britain sent her troops to defend Portugal, within the context of the European Coalitions against France.  In Spain proper the war, which presented certain aspects of a civil war, saw an uneasy alliance of reformists and traditionalists under the name of &quot;Patriots&quot; facing the puppet King Jose I Bonaparte and the occupation army; composed mainly of French but also of Italians, Neapolitans, Poles, Germans, Swiss, Dutch and even Spaniards (known as &quot;Juramentados&quot;).&#10;&#10;Spaniards, British and Portuguese form the Allied side while France and her allies and satellites form the Imperial side. A player (or team) control each side. The game allows to play the war beginning on July 1808 to April 1814, or on several later dates - November 1808,  May 1809, January 1810, January 1811 or February 1812.

And this truly has to be an honorable man.&#10;&#10;Basically this game is all about resource management and conflict, but unlike other games in this category you won't necessarily win, if you conquer the most areas. Your main goal is to earn enough honor, which can be achieved in different ways. There are two kinds of honor. 'Daimyo-Honor' is the victory condition and can be directly gained by holding provinces, and indirectly by transforming 'Samurai-Honor' at a set rate. 'Samurai-Honor' is gained by winning a defensive or offensive battle. It can be transformed into 'Daimyo-Honor' with a tea ceremony.&#10;&#10;The first Daimyo who earns 50 points of honor wins the game. If this goal is not reached within 12 turns, the Daimyo with the most honor at that point wins the game.&#10;&#10;What needs special mentioning is the turn mechanism of the game, which is really cleverly-devised: depending on the number of players, different 'offices' are in the game that get assigned to the players. In a 4-player game these offices are:&#10;&#10;Daimyo: The active player. For clarification: in game terms, every player is a Daimyo, but only the active player acts as Daimyo. The Daimyo, as active player can restock his resources, attack a province and play special tiles. Most importantly, he assigns the other offices to his opponents.&#10;&#10;Samurai: The general. He will lead the attack in the Daimyo's name. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful attack.&#10;&#10;Bushi: the poor guy who is attacked by the Daimyo. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful defense.&#10;&#10;Sensei: He gives council to the Daimyo. Tricky position, because his council can do the Daimyo harm or good. He can cancel an attack, spy on other players, use Ronin to destabilize a province, and suggest to the Daimyo how hard to punish his Samurai    when he loses a battle.&#10;&#10;The battles are resolved by a system that depends on the number of troops and a rock-paper-scissors element. The opponents have the possibility to improve their odds by investing some of their resources.&#10;&#10;The tricky part of the game is that most of your actions depend at least partly on the goodwill of one of your opponents. For instance the Daimyo depends on the Samurai to win, but the Samurai will only do this, if he sees enough gain for himself. This makes the game very interactive, with much discussion and haggling at the table.&#10;&#10;",

Bombers unleash a downpour of destruction on the Finnish capital of Helsinki. In the David and Goliath struggle that follows, the Russians &#10;swarm across the border and push back the Finns in victory after victory. The future appears grim for Finnish independence.&#10;&#10;Nowhere is the danger greater than in the central sector, where a Russian breakthrough would threaten the strongpoints of the Mannerheim Line. Newly assigned to the sector, the Finnish Colonel Paavo Talvela  surveys the terrain and chooses the place to make a stand: a lake called Tolvaj&auml;rvi.  The weary and demoralized Finnish ski troops have mere hours to recover a semblance of order before the Russian juggernaut smashes into them yet again. Over the next five days, the world watches in awe as the Finns manage to halt the Russian advance through sheer heroic determination.  Then, miraculously, the Finns launch a successful counterattack...&#10;&#10;Red Winter is a two player historical game which simulates the unusual battle at Tolvaj&auml;rvi at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns.  Players assume the roles of the Russian and Finnish commanders, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Russian heavy machine gun companies, mortars, tanks, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes many tried-and-true &quot;classic&quot; wargame mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, attrition losses from sub-zero weather conditions, and more.  The design focuses foremost on playability, with low counter  density, concise rules, and sleek, simple mechanics that combine to allow each player the luxury of completing his turn in about five minutes.  This means the full 40 turn campaign game is playable in a single afternoon.  The large 5/8 inch counters and oversized hexes further increase playability.

        "description": "This new version of Destruction of Army Group Center is a thorough redesign, by Ty Bomba, of the game originally published by old-SPI in the early 1970s (in S&amp;T#36). The campaign under examination is &ldquo;Operation Bagration,&rdquo; the Red Army&rsquo;s summer offensive of 1944 during which they destroyed more German manpower and equipment than had been lost at Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;Without question a one-sided affair in terms of which side is &lsquo;shaping the battlefield&rsquo; and &lsquo;controlling the tempo,&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve managed to make things more interesting for both players by broadening the map to cover not only Byelorussia, but all of the Baltic Republics as well as the northwest Ukraine. That expansion gives both players more interesting options and strategies in terms of how to pursue victory.&#10; Each hex on the 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map equals 16 miles (26 kilometers). Each of the nine game turns equals one week, from IV June through IV August. Units of maneuver are corps (and static &ldquo;fortified localities&rdquo;) for the Germans and armies for the Soviets. The latter&rsquo;s great airpower advantage is represented in the form of 10 &ldquo;air armies.&rdquo; There are 176 large-size unit-counters included, most done in NATO-style, but also with iconic markers. The system is an adaptation of the one used in issue number three&rsquo;s Bulge, which means two experienced players can finish a match in about three to four hours.&#10;&#10;The historical scenario provides exact set ups for both sides, but there are also free-deployment options. The &ldquo;Bold Stroke&rdquo; scenario allows the Soviet player to try the approach the Germans were expecting: putting the weight of the offensive in the western Pripyat Marsh and driving straight for Koenigsberg. Other options allow the investigation of such historical &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; as the failure of the Western Allies&rsquo; D-Day landing or no July bomb plot against Hitler.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Pocket at Falaise is a game on the final phase of the Allied campaign in Normandy. After the failure of Hitler&rsquo;s counterattack in early August to halt the Allied breakout from Normandy, the German 7th and 5th Panzer Armies found themselves on the verge of being pocketed by converging American and British pincers. On the evening of August 16th the Germans began to pull back behind the Orne and Dives rivers, hoping to regroup for a defense of the Seine, even as the Allies attempted to close the trap on some twentyfive German divisions. Ultimately, about half the German forces in the pocket escaped, leaving almost all their heavy equipment behind. It was a major Allied victory, but not a war-winning one.&#10;&#10;At the end of the Gulf War in '91, cable TV news was full of horrific photos from the &quot;Highway of Death,&quot; the route back to Iraq from Kuwait that seemed, almost literally, to be &quot;paved&quot; with burnt-out vehicles. Those who study WWII remember similar destruction... on the road out of the Falaise Pocket... where 25 German divisions raced for survival, while the Allied armies aimed to turn Hitler's delayed counterattack on Normandy from failure to war-ending disaster. In one sense, neither side succeeded. But the devastation was something unprecedented.&#10;&#10;Now, you have a chance to do better. The Pocket at Falaise puts each player in the difficult position of trying to overcome the obstacles, both human and mechanical, tactical and operational, that interfered with success in 1944. Award-winning designer Ted Racier explains:&#10;&#10;The story of the Falaise battle is that of two German armies trying to escape a trap set for them by their own high command, and of the Allied armies trying to close the trap, despite the hesitations and divisions of their own higher commanders.&#10;&#10;While we may think of the Allies as having overwhelming forces, at the actual point of contact, there were relatively weak units trying to &quot;plug the leak&quot; against overwhelming numbers of intensely motivated Germans. The situation means that the &quot;retreating&quot; Germans are actually forced to do a lot of attacking, while the &quot;advancing&quot; allies found themselves in a desperate defense. The Pocket at Falaise uses a chit-pull activation system to capture some of the chaotic and uncoordinated efforts. Players are forced to juggle to make the best out of an increasingly difficult situation, and a combat scale that straddles &quot;tactical&quot; and &quot;operational,&quot; aiming to capture the best of both without adding a lot of fiddly rules. A complete set of solitaire rules for the game completes the package.&#10;&#10;Eisenhower called it, &quot;The Great Killing Ground.&quot; What the Germans called it cannot be printed.

As the Spanish player you will need to determine where you will build your siege gun redoubts and will then have to protect your soldiers from raiding British units to finish the works in time to mount an effective bombardment. As the British player, you have far fewer forces, but armed with special raiding rules, your Regulars, Tories and Indian allies must harass and erode Spanish morale, while delaying the construction of Spanish siege works for as long as possible in the hope of keeping your three forts intact to face the coming coup de main.&#10;&#10;The game begins with Don Bernardo de Galvez&rsquo;s army of 5,000 having just landed on the mainland. How many forces actually are present is decided in a special phase during the initial set-up wherein that portion of the Spanish army that sailed from Havana must run the gauntlet of the Red Cliffs Fort guns. Hence, the starting forces for Spain are likely to be different for each game played as units and leaders are eliminated or delayed in their arrival. Once these forces are ashore, the Spanish player faces some hard choices. Does he send forces to take out the Red Cliffs Fort, to protect his turn 7 Spanish and French reinforcements from having to run the same gauntlet, or does the Spanish player immediately begin construction of the siege works, to achieve the longest possible bombardment before the coup de main?&#10;&#10;The British player is outnumbered, but must employ his small forces in aggressive and often risky raids to slow down siege construction, wear down Spanish morale and worry the Spanish lines of supply. Getting a small force into one of two Spanish stockades can be devastating for the Spanish. Thus, though numerically superior, the Spanish player has much to do and protect, and will often be spread thin by a well-conceived series of raids. Giving the Spanish too many siege turns to bombard your three forts and/or permitting the Spanish to launch the coup de main with high army morale is likely to spell disaster for the British player.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player either moves one frog from one lilypad to an adjacent one (removing the bridge after doing so, except for the bridge to a player's home, which can never be removed) or places one bridge on the board to connect two lilypads. If a frog lands on an occupied space (other than a player's home), the frog already on that space must jump away in a direction of the active player's choosing, removing the bridge used; if that frog lands next to another, then the process repeats. If a frog cannot jump away when encroached upon due to a lack of bridges, then the initial jump is illegal and the active player must take another action.&#10;&#10;Each player has four action cards that can be used once each game to place two bridges, jump without needing a bridge, remove an additional bridge, or take an extra jump. Get all your frogs into the other players' homes, with at least one frog in each location, and you win.&#10;&#10;",

Start with a hand of ... 4? On your turn, either sail (start a voyage if you're not on one, or continue the current voyage) or market (if you're not on a voyage).To sail further, play a card with the ship moving to the right -- #wheels adds to distance of voyage. May play out of your hand, or from your score pile (play face down; counts as 3 wheels). OR, explore: rotate last card clockwise, draw cards from deck (2 x distance sailed, hand limit 12). After exploring, must sail home; cards played count 2xwheels -- home when you've played at least the distance of the voyage. Upon arriving home, draw bonus cards (hand limit still applies):&#10;- if voyage was longest distance of all current voyages, 1 card.&#10;- if voyage was 7 wheels, 1 card; 8 wheels, 2; 9+ wheels, 3.&#10;&#10;If Marketing, add cards from hand to display; max 12 cards on display. Sort by type of goods. OR, sell cards already on display: sell all possible. Rarest good (looking at all markets on table) worth 1 coin per card. Most popular worth 1 coin/2 cards. All others are common, and worth 1 coin/3 cards. If tied for rarest/popular, goods become common. Sold goods are flipped over to represent coins (added to your score pile) or discarded.&#10;&#10;Game ends immediately if, after the first time through the draw deck, all players are at home at the same time; or the 2nd time through the draw deck.

Players are planning cathedral layout and overseeing work at the construction site in tandem, in the same time trying to gain advantage over the opposite player.&#10;&#10;The temple is built by laying square tiles adjacent to the board or already built tiles. Tiles form the plan of the cathedral. These tiles, distinguished by four colors, represent different elements of the cathedral. The pool of tiles available to players is random. Later, the players place pawns on the tiles &ndash; these pawns are the teams of builders: foremen, masons and carpenters, who will make the design a reality.&#10;&#10;The players strive to achieve two goals: to lay their cathedral tiles so as to create the largest possible areas representing a single color, and to have more pawns in these areas than their opponent.&#10;&#10;Every tile bears also one special action that could be played instead of adding a tile to the cathedral. Using these actions player may move pawns from tile to tile, promote them (increasing their value) or manipulate the tiles. Execution of specific order excludes the tile from being used as part of cathedral, so choice between expanding the edifice and making some action is strategic. Planning and optimal use of available resources is important, as both participants share the same selection of tiles. Thus, tiles and actions shown on them not used by the player in her or his turn become immediately available to his opponent.&#10;&#10;Some tiles trigger movement of a special King pawn, which moves along the scoring track. Every few moves, the King pawn comes to a space indicating a royal visit to the cathedral. During each royal visit, the progress of work is assessed and Victory Points are assigned to the players. The number of VPs each player is awarded depends on the size and number of the areas controlled by their pawns at the moment of scoring. The more areas the player controls, and the bigger these are, the greater the reward for the player. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has claimed more Victory Points.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Nothing Gained But Glory",
        "description": "Nothing Gained But Glory will be the fifth volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series. It features several pivotal battles in Baltic region of the late 17th century - a period where rulers struggled to centralize power in their realms and to introduce permanent standing armies instead of expensive mercenary forces. It shows the highly trained and well led army of Sweden struggling to defend its massive gains from the Thirty Years War and the Northern Wars of 1655-1661 against the forces of Denmark and Brandenburg, reinforced by contingents from Austria, the United Provinces, M&uuml;nster, Hesse-Kassel and Poland.&#10;&#10;The personalities in the game include the great Swedish warrior king Carl XI, Brandenburg&acute;s Frederick William (the Great Elector), and King Christian V of Denmark-Norway. Never before have so many monarchs been in one M&amp;P box!&#10;&#10;Nearly all the scenarios in this module are smaller than the typical Musket &amp; Pike scenarios, and thus take less time and space to play. For the same reasons it is a great introductory game to the series.&#10;&#10;The Historical Background&#10;&#10;The Scanian War was prompted by the Franco-Dutch War of 1672-1678. Sweden had allied with France against several European countries, and was eventually forced to fulfill her treaty obligations to France by invading Brandenburg. This invasion was an attempt to force Brandenburg to withdraw from the fighting against France, but the invasion was conducted without the usual energy and force of previous Swedish offensives. When the Brandenburg Army returned home much faster than anticipated the Swedes started to withdraw, but were caught by the Brandenburgers and defeated at the battle of Fehrbellin on June 28th 1675. The previously &quot;unbeatable&quot; Swedish Army had lost a battle, and this key event soon persuaded others to join the war.&#10;&#10;Most notable of these was Denmark, which saw its chance to regain the Scanian lands lost in the Northern Wars. (Scania is the southern tip of Sweden, just across the Oeresund, the Sound, from Denmark.) After mopping up the Swedish possessions of Wismar and Bremen, the Danish Army landed in Scania on June 29, 1676. Danish King Christian V led 15,000 troops against a defending Swedish Army of 5,000 men that were spread out over the province. Initially the operation was a great success. Large parts of the local peasantry sided with Denmark and the outnumbered Swedish troops were in bad shape. Town after town fell into the hands of the Danes and the Swedes had to retreat north to Sweden proper. After a month only the fortified town of Malm&ouml; remained under Swedish control. At sea the situation wasn&acute;t any better for the Swedes, as their navy lost several battles against the combined Danish- Dutch Navy, and left the command of the sea in the hands of the allies.&#10;&#10;Two factors helped to save Sweden from ruin: the splendid courage of their young king who resolutely and successfully kept the Danish invaders at bay, and the diplomatic activity of Louis XIV, the French king.&#10;&#10;The first ray of light for the Swedish cause came with the battle of Halmstad in August 1675 when the king succeeded in outmaneuvering and destroying a small Danish force sent north to take Halmstad and link up with the forces operating out from Norway. As the Swedish Army slowly grew larger it became possible to meet the Danish main army head on, and the Swedes were victorious at the battles of Lund in December 1676 and Landskrona in June 1677. These battles caused the fighting to stalemate on the Scanian front, as the Danish could supply and reinforce their coastal fortresses by sea, but didn&acute;t dare venture inland to meet the Swedish Army in a field battle again.&#10;&#10;The focus of the war therefore shifted to the German front once again, where the Brandenburg Army was slowly conquering the Swedish fortresses and fortified cities one by one. The Danish Army sent an expeditionary force to the island of R&uuml;gen and captured it, but lost it again in January 1678 after a winter of horrid attrition, when the Swedes returned to the island once more and defeated them in the battle of Warksow. Later in 1678 the Allies would take R&uuml;gen once more, and eventually all the Swedish possessions in Germany were lost.&#10;&#10;Events in Western Europe would once again have far reaching effects on the Baltic as the end of the Franco-Dutch war in 1678 gave France the power to force an end to the Scanian War and dictate the peace treaties of Fontainebleau. These treaties restored almost all the Swedish possessions lost during the war, and so the end result was truly &ldquo;Nothing Gained but Glory.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The 7 battles included in Nothing Gained but Glory are:&#10;&#10;Nyborg, November 14, 1659 - (While not part of the Scanian War, this bonus battle from the Northern War of 1655-1660 features many of the same participants.) The Swedes had occupied the Danish island of F&uuml;nen, but following the landings of two Allied forces and their subsequent combination the Swedes had to fight to win time for an evacuation from the island. With no more room to retreat and the port town of Nyborg&acute;s fortifications in a sorry state, the 7,000 strong Swedish Army positioned itself in good defensive terrain between a lake and a forest. While command difficulties in the 11,000 strong Allied Army almost cost them the battle, the Allies eventually prevailed, forcing the Swedish Army to flee to Nyborg, where it surrendered the next day.&#10;&#10;Fehrbellin, June 28, 1675 - Returning from fighting against France to face the Swedish invasion, the highly mobile Brandenburg Army of 5,600 cavalry and 13 guns faced a retreating Swedish Army of 7,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 7 guns outside the town of Fehrbellin. A poor deployment of the Swedish Army combined with aggressive handling of the Brandenburg cavalry forced the Swedes from the field. Although the losses in the battle were about equal, the Swedish Army was severely reduced by the subsequent pursuit, raiding peasant guerilla, desertion, and starvation. While only of minor importance militarily, the victory had an enormous psychological impact: the Swedes, long considered &quot;unbeatable&quot;, had been bested. With the myth of Swedish invincibility broken, Denmark decided the time was right to settle its scores with Sweden and entered the war. Frederick William henceforth was known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot; and the army that he and Derfflinger had led to victory became the core of the future famous Prussian Army.&#10;&#10;Halmstad, August 17, 1676 - After the initial great successes for the Danish forces following the landings in Scania in late June 1676, a small Danish force of 3,500 men under Jacob Duncan was detached from the main army and ordered to advance north to take the town of Halmstad and if possible link up with the Norwegian forces under General Gyldenl&oslash;ve. Sensing the possibility of destroying the unsupported Danish detachment, the Swedish king reacted and by heavy force marching succeeded in cutting off Duncan from his line of communications, forcing him to fight his way back. Duncan moved against the Swedes, but then went on the defensive. The Swedes took the initiative, collapsed both of the Danish flanks, and then overwhelmed the center, forcing the army to surrender. This battle ended the Danish plans of linking up with the Norwegians, and provided a much-needed boost to Swedish morale.&#10;&#10;Lund, December 4, 1676 - This was the bloodiest battle in the history of Scandinavia, with almost 9,000 killed (out of 12,000 Danes and 8,000 Swedes) after an intense day-long battle fought in the chilling cold of the Scandinavian winter. After a cross-river standoff that lasted for a month, the Swedes attacked when the river froze. The Swedes initially had the advantage, and their right wing (along with the king) routed the Danish left and pursued it off the field. The rest of the Swedish Army was then outnumbered, and just as they were about to succumb, the king and part of his wing showed up in the Danish rear, saving the battle for the Swedes.&#10;&#10;Malm&ouml;, June 25-26, 1677 - Malm&ouml;, the regional capital of Scania, was the only major town that didn&acute;t fall during the 1676 Danish offensive, and had been a thorn in the Danish side ever since. In June 1677 the Danes decided to take the town by besieging it.&#10;When news arrived that the Swedish Navy had set sail to break the blockade of the town and that the Swedish Army was moving to relieve the town, the Danes decided to force the issue and storm the town, even though the siege hadn&acute;t progressed very far. On the Swedish side, the town commander Fabian Fersen prepared his 2,300 strong garrison well, and they fought with desperate courage as they knew it was victory or death. While the Danes were able to scale the wall and break into the city, a determined Swedish counterattack destroyed them before they could open the gates for more Danish troops.&#10;(This is a medium sized battle on a half map with various special rules to reflect the many special circumstances of storming a fortified town at night.)&#10;&#10;Landskrona, July 14, 1677 - After the defeat of the Danish Army at Malm&ouml;, the Swedish king decided the time was right to attack them before they could be reinforced by their German and Austrian allies. He thus moved his 10,000 regulars and 4,000 peasant militia towards the Danish Army located at Landskrona. However, the Danes had received their reinforcements that replenished their numbers to 14,000, and the Danish king felt confident about fighting a field battle. This was a hard-fought battle which saw both armies experimenting with combined arms wings and the personal involvement of the monarchs of both armies.&#10;&#10;Warksow, January 18, 1678 - As the war had reached a stalemate on the Scanian front the Danish forces invaded the island of R&uuml;gen in the fall of 1677. They quickly conquered most of the island except for a small Swedish fortified bridgehead. As supplies ran low and attrition ravaged the army, large parts of the Danish expedition were withdrawn from the island, leaving just under 5,000 men. This allowed the Swedes to transfer 3,500 men from their field army in Germany to the remaining bridgehead in early January 1678 and try to take back the island. The armies met at Warksow, where a Swedish cannonade killed the commander of the Danish Army, paralyzing it. Most of the Danish expeditionary force was captured during the battle or in the aftermath as the Swedes quickly cleared R&uuml;gen.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;1 series rulebook&#10;1 playbook&#10;3 countersheets&#10;2 2.5 map sheets, 2 of which are backprinted&#10;1 10-sided die&#10;3 Player Aid Cards&#10;&#10;",

This will be the first game in the series Sengoku Jidai, which will cover battles in 16th century Japan. The system is designed so players can finish a game in an evening, and has simple but dynamic mechanics.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player takes the role of a commander in chief. Each army consists of various clans, and the players have to choose an action for each of their clans. Each clan is represented by 1 to 3 units. The units have various abilities, summarized by the 4 factors: &eacute;lan, mass, fire and the presence of a leader. Elan represents factors such as the unit's mobility, and its boldness in attack, and is also used to reflect the advantage that cavalry can have over infantry when attacking. The unit's mass represents its staying power, such as its ability to resist a cavalry charge or a rout.&#10;&#10;A unit's abilities are tied to the value of its four factors and the current mode of the clan that it belongs to. A clan can be placed in one of four modes: Attack, Defense, Move, and Rally. The owning clan's mode will affect a unit's ability to move or engage in combat.&#10;&#10;A game turn consists of alternating phases where a player can activate his units. The order in which activations will occur is tied to a chit pull system.&#10;&#10;The game system requires each player to plan carefully how to win. They must maneuver to gain numerical superiority, deploy in terrain that takes advantage of their clan's mode, and try to surprise his opponent by attacking troops that are not prepared.&#10;&#10;The system also places the players under the same historical limitations as the actual Japanese leaders. Japanese generals of this time prearranged their battle plans and coordinated their armies with a precise system of semaphore flags and sound signals.&#10;&#10;The game includes 2 scenarios: one depicting the historical battle, and a &quot;what if?&quot; hypothetical scenario. In the historical scenario, Takeda's army is divided in two contingents. One of the contingents is taken by surprise by Uesugi's army, and has to fight a holding action until the rest of the army can come to its aid.&#10;The hypothetical scenario explores what could have happened several days before the historical battle.&#10;&#10;In Kawanakajima 1561 a hex represents about 250 meters and a strength point corresponds to around 100 men.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&#10;     1 map A1 (84cm*60cm)&#10;     228 game counters (88 5/8inch, 140 1/2inch)&#10;     one rule book with scenarios&#10;     Game play aids&#10;     Cardboard jacket&#10;     4 dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Finally, after four months of fierce battle, the Red Army will win the great prize of this campaign, Riga, and pocket the enemy in the Courland region of Latvia.&#10;&#10;Baltic Gap allows players to explore this interesting campaign from a variety of historical and hypothetical vantage points. Long campaign games can be enjoyed by up to five players. Several short scenarios are also provided, and these work best with a single player per side.&#10;&#10;Baltic Gap is the 11th game in the award winning Operational Combat System (&ldquo;OCS&rdquo;). It stays true to the ground breaking earlier games in the system that allow players a deeper glimpse into why the skills and behaviors of the two sides were so very different. Here in 1944, we find a much more developed Russian army (much more advanced than the one shown in the 2007 CSR Award winning game Case Blue) facing a still potent German Wehrmacht.

The French edition is produced by Filosofia.&#10;&#10;As with Power Grid, the object of M&eacute;gawatts is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;It differs from Power Grid by the maps included. Where Power Grid has the USA/Germany maps, the French version by Filosofia has the Qu&eacute;bec/France maps.&#10;&#10;The Qu&eacute;bec map uses minor rules change that makes a bigger use of the renewable power plants to represent the regional reality of hydro-electricity.&#10;&#10;The ruleset includes the basic game, as in Power Grid plus the minor rule changes for the two maps included.&#10;&#10; Re-Implements: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Power Grid&#10;     Funkenschlag&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Power Grid: France/Italy&#10;     Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe&#10;     Atolla Modulis (fan expansion for Funkenschlag)&#10;     Power Grid: The New Power Plant Cards&#10;     Power Grid: China/Korea&#10;     Power Grid: Flux Generator&#10;&#10;&#10;The expansions Power Grid: France/Italy, Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe and Power Grid: China/Korea include new double-sided game boards.

Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android&rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she&rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you&rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons.&#10;&#10;During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties.&#10;&#10;The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed. At that point, victory points are awarded based on the aforementioned sectors. The player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

STAVKA planned an offensive during the summer of 1944 to coincide with the Normandy landings. The objective was to force Finland out of the war. Towards this end, the Soviets amassed two ground armies, one air army, and an impressive amount of artillery. Confident after a series of victories against the Germans, the Red Army attacked in Karelia on 9 June 44. The attack began with an overwhelming artillery barrage (second only to the Oder crossings in intensity). Finnish lines were pushed back and then breached&mdash;the race for Viipuri/Vyborg was on. The capture of this city would open the road to Helsinki.&#10;&#10;The game features a unique &ldquo;Boss Point&rdquo; System which precludes either player from knowing how long the game will last. For the Russian player, this represents the gun to his head of an unhappy dictator who will gladly send you to a Gulag forever if you fail in your goals. For the Finns, you know that you are understrength and that the Russians will destroy you if given enough time, but you need to hang on for dear life in order to be in the best possible position when the Boss&rsquo; patience runs out.&#10;&#10;Players will find two very different armies to command. The Russians are the proverbial 500 lb gorilla, but one that takes time to prepare big operations and isn&rsquo;t fleet of foot enough to do small scale attacks.&#10;&#10;The Finns have splendid artillery and are designed for a mobile defense which, if done right, will leave the Russians flailing in the air. You have three defensive lines to use and an innovative &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; unit feature that allows your thin ranks to try to hang on to them.&#10;&#10;Please note, this is not the Winter War of 1939! This is a well developed late war Russian army, not the hapless troops of the opening years of the war.

Players can fund distributors across the country, but if they don&rsquo;t supply distributors with vehicles to sell, they go bankrupt, taking your investment with them.  Alternatively, players can drop the prices on their cars to move their market share, or even temporarily improve sales rates at the cost of research.

The goal is to capture the opponents' pieces and to move your own pieces to the opponents' starting rows.&#10;&#10;Players have nine towers in three heights and three shapes (squared, hexagonal and triangular prisms). To set up the game, players lay out the game boards, then take turns placing towers one by one on the starting edges of their game boards, five towers on one board and four on the other.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must move one tower one space forward, either straight or diagonally; the player can choose freely which tower to move on which game board, but moving on one board precludes movement on the other, so choose wisely! A tower can capture another tower by moving onto its space, but only in the right circumstances. If the two towers are the same height, the capturing tower must have more sides than the one being captured; if their heights differ, the capturing tower must be one level taller than the tower being captured. The exception is the smallest triangular tower, which can capture the opponent's tallest hexagonal tower. A tower can also move sideways when capturing, but not when merely moving on the game board; thus, even after a tower reaches the opponent's back row, it might still be at risk of capture (or possibly the one doing the capturing).&#10;&#10;If no captures are possible on a game board, that board is frozen and players can no longer move their pieces on it. As soon as two boards are frozen, the game ends. Players score five points for each tower they've captured and three points for each of their own towers that has reached an opponent's starting edge.
