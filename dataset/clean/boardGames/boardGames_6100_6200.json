The miasmic shockwave of pure otherworldly magic spread outward from a point somewhere in the middle east, and in a few short hours plunged the entire globe into chaos. In those terrible moments, human civilization changed forever. &#10;&#10;Magic infused their very bones, manifested in their children, came unbidden to the fingertips of their women, and plagued their countryside in uncontrolled bursts of power. Ordinary beasts of the wilderness were turned by these bursts into fanciful creatures of legend. Entire tribes of humans from all corners of the world were altered by the flood of uncontrolled magic, changing before the very eyes of their friends and neighbors into elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, centaurs, and even minotaurs. Creatures that normally existed between our reality and others were shunted into this one, leaving ghosts, faeries, and other magical creatures stranded in our world in ways they were never intended to be. Even remnants of the Old World, gods of the ancients and their ken, were awakened from their immortal slumber through this great cataclysm to trouble mankind once more.&#10;&#10;The world had changed forever.&#10;&#10;The year is now 37BCE and the middle-east sits at the center of a vast struggle to control humanity&rsquo;s fate. Three powerful nations have harnessed the power unleashed by the day of chaos, and they struggle to claim dominance over the known world. Their arcane legions are now yours to control.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;If you ever wondered what happened to the guys from WizKids just take a look at this game and you will know what they have been doing with the downtime after WizKids closed their doors.&#10;&#10;Players each field &quot;bases&quot; of variable sizes (Sortie/small and Formation/large) with individual figures inserted into starting positions on the base. The goal is to control victory point areas and inflict losses on the opponent. Movement and battle resolution are conducted through a unique formation management mechanic that allows players to move figures around on the unit bases to increase either movement/melee/ranged combat at the cost of losing capabilities in the other areas.&#10;&#10;Currently wrapping up play-testing as of May 2009. Arcane Legions will be available in September of 2009. Initially, look for 3 different factions (Egyptians, Romans, and Han Dynasty).&#10;&#10;Figures are highly detailed true 25mm made from PVC 105. Common figures are unpainted with colored tempo prints on banners and shields, while all the uncommon, rare and Commander figures (Booster Pack contents) are fully pre-painted. The game is designed to use both types. There are 9 different unpainted common figures for each faction and at least 20 different fully painted premium figures for each faction. If you buy a legion bundle of a faction you receive around 70 prepainted figures, whereas buying one of each army pack gets you about 54 unpainted figures.&#10;&#10;With more than 110 figures, the Starter Pack includes small armies for all three factions and enough formation bases, sortie bases and base cards for a complete two player game.  The Army Packs contain 40 common soldiers.  The Cavalry Packs contain 15 mounted figures.  The Booster Packs contain 5-10 (depending on the size) Leader / special figures and their associated base cards, plus five additional formation base cards for use with figures from the Army and Cavalry Packs.&#10;&#10;All Arcane Legions products (with the exception of the Starter) can be purchased faction specific.&#10;&#10;",

In the board game Opera, the players bring Opera to the public. In Venice, Vienna, Berlin, London, Paris and Milan great Opera houses arise. Opera leads the players through the periods of Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. The epic music of six famous composers H&auml;ndel, Monteverdi, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi will bring the public to their Opera houses.&#10;&#10;Clever budgeting is essential to gain control and be the master of your own success. Each round the players determine their budget level to influence the order of play and to activate the characters in the game. The players build new Opera Houses, scout for new Operas of popular composers and try to earn some money. Sometimes they choose to cash in at the Palazzo where the Signora pays them well, but in the long term music are one of the key fundamentals to build your empire. The elegant Maestro brings the performance of an Opera to a higher level and the Critico can make or break a composer. Do not overvalue the three counting rounds with progressively growing value, because a well timed appearance of the Esperto might just bring you the victory in Opera. Ducats and capacity are key elements to facilitate the growth of your empire and influence, but in the end wealth is just an instrument to attain higher ends.&#10;&#10;In Opera the players must plan well. Introducing an Intermezzo from time to time might be helpful to seize the initiative on a decisive moment in the game. Opera takes place over 9 rounds of play, divided in 3 episodes. Each episode consists of three playing rounds and a counting round. The player with the highest number of victory points after the third and last counting round will be the victor.&#10;&#10;Opera has been succesfully launched on October 21st, 2009. Complete rules are available in the English, Dutch and German language.

Each Pocket Battles game will feature two armies from a particular era or genre (yes, fantasy and sci-fi, we are looking at you).&#10;&#10;The basic rules of the game are fairly simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).&#10;&#10;On you turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one existing token on your unit, it would cost you two additional tokens to activate; if you had three tokens on the unit, it would cost you four additional tokens, and so on).&#10;&#10;After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row).

It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).&#10;&#10;Yomi is the Japanese word for &ldquo;reading&rdquo;, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.&#10;&#10;Champion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; right almost every time, no matter the game.&#10;&#10;The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems &quot;just random,&quot; you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do. Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Yomi (second edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In their quest for power (points), players build Ziggurats (permanent outposts), wells, make sacrifices to gods and try to get along with nobles of Assur - the capital of Assyria. The game is a light-weight eurogame, built around the short-term rapid point gains vs long-term investments dilemma. General flow of play is as follows:&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Players get resources for expansion and decide on play order&#10;&#10;In this phase, players pick cards with resources that enable expansion on the board. In general he/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.&#10;&#10;Players begin to form strings and/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Players spend money/camels on various investments.&#10;&#10;A player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles. After each era comes the flood: the board is partially cleaned up, but players also capitalize on their investments from phase 3. Each round, players also score points for huts (those built on fertile land between the two rivers bring more points) and ziggurat tiles.&#10;&#10;In comparison to other games from Ystari's series - Assyria is lighter than Caylus, Olympos, Ys or Sylla (in terms of complexity, available choices - represented by numerous tiles, cards, icons, cards etc. that need to be remembered and can be combined during play), but heavier than Yspahan, Mykerinos or Metropolis.&#10;&#10;",

Everywhere the Inmun Gun (the North Korean Army) was in full retreat toward the Chinese border, closely pursued by the victorious Allies.&#10;&#10;Chinese intervention in the war had been considered and dismissed as a bluff by the UN Command. Thus, the UN forces were badly overextended when the bluff materialized as a force of thirty divisions, having infiltrated into the Korean mountains.&#10;&#10;UN forces were sent reeling back to the 38th Parallel in confusion, attempting to reestablish a front line. The Communists followed relentlessly, infiltrating deep into UN positions.

Ground scale is 10 miles per hex and turns are weekly. Weather plays a predominant role, influencing movement and combat options for both sides. Yalu, like no other game, effectively shows the differences in the opposing sides' Rules of Engagement - the two sides simply feel and play differently.&#10;&#10;This is the second edition of Yalu; the first was published in GDW's Conflict Games line in 1977.

Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.&#10;&#10;The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.&#10;&#10;A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple. Adults may tire from repeats of The Adventurers, but kids will get lots of thrills.&#10;&#10;",

Players will try to define the key issue in the states. Will McCain dominate the national security debate, or can Obama play on people's fears over the economy? As the campaign manager of a national presidential campaign, you will either identify the road to the White House, or the road to irrelevance.&#10;&#10;User review: The object of the game (and it is a game, not a simulation) is to lead your candidate, John McCain or Barack Obama, to victory by getting 270 electoral votes. Twenty battleground states are up for grabs in this game of cardplay.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of forty five Campaign Strategy cards; only fifteen can be used in the game. (The rules suggest a selected fifteen cards for novices.) Each player also has a deck of ten battleground state tiles. Each player will select two of their states to put into play. (again, the rules make a suggestion for novices.)&#10;In turn, a player either plays a card from one's own hand and follows the instructions on it or draws a card if fewer than five are already held.&#10;&#10;To win a state, a player must get complete support from the state's voters in the issue which has more support of the people. Each state also has two key demographics. A shift in which demographic takes precidence also may affect the effect of a player's cards.&#10;&#10;Some cards require players to go &quot;negative.&quot; These cards require the opponent to roll a die and the result may give the opponent an unintended benefit.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player wins a state, the electoral votes are added to that candidate's tally. A state is brought into play by the winning manager and chance card is put into effect.&#10;&#10;The game is over when one manager scores 270 electoral votes. That player is the winner. A tie, resulting in winner, is possible.&#10;&#10;",

The game will come with a 93 card Rogues and Warriors Deck, a bunch of 6 sided dice, coin tokens, debt and loan tokens and rules for at least 7 games! Some of the games use dice. Some of the games use cards from the Rogues and Warriors Deck, and some of the games use dice and cards.&#10;&#10;This card deck was developed as a stand-alone game as well as a possible replacement to the gambling component in Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 90 cards. The deck is broken down into three colors (rust, green, and blue) with 6 different symbols. The card faces feature 1 Knight, 2 Ladys, 3 Bards, 4 Merchants, and 5 Rogues per card symbol. There is a die symbol on each card with a number of pips equal to the number of cards of its type and a set of symbols on the right that denote character superiority in certain game variations. Some games with this deck involve 6 D6 dice (not included).&#10;&#10;There are five base games included and are as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rogues and Warriors - Similar to two card poker, each player is dealt two cards. You compare these two cards to the symbols on the right to determine how powerful your hand is.&#10;     Threes - Uses all dice, no cards. &#10;     Jack of All Trades - Uses 5 dice and only the Rogue and Warrior cards. The theme is putting your workers to work and using the cards and dice to complete jobs.&#10;     Den of Thieves - No dice.

The map encompasses the entire theater of war from the English Channel to the Swiss Border. The game system used is a streamlined derivative of the 1914, Twilight in the East system, modified to speed play, with care not to lose focus on those aspects of warfare that made the opening stages of WWI so unique. This game system, in conjunction with the accurate map, allows the German advance to be conducted along historical routes with the eminent &ldquo;Open Flank&rdquo; present (instead of units strung out from map edge to map edge). The Allied player has an opportunity to recreate a &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; type victory or to stop the Germans earlier. Likewise, the German player has a chance to change history and defeat the Allies&rsquo; armies in 1914.&#10;&#10;The Grand Campaign scenario covers the period from the fall of Liege on August 16th to exhaustion at Ypres in mid-November. Two shorter scenarios, The Battle for Lorraine (a learning scenario) and From the Marne to Stalemate are also provided.&#10;&#10;1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a playable &ldquo;Monster Game&rdquo; designed with the expressed goal that the majority of the game can be completed by four dedicated players in one five-day long Expo. The 24-page rules booklet is concise, well written and organized. The game is exciting and gives wonderful insights into one of the most important campaigns of the twentieth century. The result is that 1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a game that the &ldquo;WW1 enthusiast&rdquo; must have and that a gaming connoisseur will enjoy.&#10;&#10;Time Scale: Game turns vary between two and four days in length.&#10;Map Scale: Eight kilometers per hex.&#10;Unit Scale: Division/Brigade.&#10;Number of Players: one to many (well suited for four players).&#10;&#10;Game Designer: Michael Resch&#10;Research and Design Assistance: Rian van Meeteren&#10;Developed by: Dick Vohlers&#10;Map Design Assistance: S.

The one with the most points after 7 rounds of questions is the winner!&#10;&#10;Gambit categories include: Business &amp; Economy; Art &amp; Literature; Geography &amp; Nature; History &amp; Government; Pop Culture; Science; Sports &amp; Leisure; and Wild Card. The set of questions in Gambit 7 were designed to be culturally appropriate for each specific language version.&#10;&#10;While Gambit 7 can be played with as few as 3 players, the more friends and family you gather, the more fun and excitement you will experience! With more than 7 players, simply split into teams of 2 or 3 and work together to answer the questions and decide how to bet.&#10;&#10;A german mini edition was published in 2008 for promotional use under the name &quot;Gambit 7 Das mini Spiel&quot;. It contains 7 cards and a ruleset printed on a seperate card.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In the near future, nanofacturing techniques will allow incredible new materials to be built atom by atom. But they can only be built in the zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions in space. Various private and government enterprises race to establish a buckytube mechanosynthesis factory on a suitable carbonaceous asteroid. To do so, they accumulate tanks of water in orbiting fuel depots, to be used as rocket propellant. Also needed are remote-controlled robonauts to do the grunt work.&#10;&#10;The key to success is water in LEO (low Earth orbit). At first, water will be expensively supported out of the deep gravity well of Earth. But for a third the fuel and energy, water can be supplied from Luna, the moons of Mars, or other nearby hydrated objects.  Extracting resources at the work site is called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Whoever develops ISRU technology able to glean water from space rather than Earth will gain the strategic high ground to make money through exoglobalization.&#10;&#10;In High Frontier, players are Earth governments which are racing to put together a functioning space program to extract resources and colonize the other planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system.  Players use water in LEO as currency to bid on space-related patents for thrusters, refineries, and robotics.  Putting together a functional craft is not easy, as the heavier the craft becomes, the less maneuverable it is and the more fuel (also water in LEO) the craft will require, so players have to balance useful heavy parts with lighter, less functional parts.  Victory points are awarded for successful mineral extractions, and for being the first to reach key technologies and exploration points in the solar system.&#10;&#10;Now in its second edition.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In ancient times long gone by, when the veil between the world of the humans and the realm of magic was thinner, allmighty wizards battled each other in epic duels to determine who was the master of sorcery and arcane wisdom. Armed with a Spellbook and with the aid of the enchanted Element-Stones, the sorcerers summoned fantastic Creatures and magical Spells. A wizard who had no more pages left in his Spellbook would eventually have lost the magical battle of wits.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent&rsquo;s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). Is a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy&rsquo;s capital.&#10;&#10;Set in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.&#10;&#10;Rather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor.&#10;&#10;Rather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is &quot;burned.&quot; If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws. Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents. Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage. This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards. You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:&#10;&#10;* 1 Rulebook&#10;    * 220 Cards representing 4 factions&#10;    * 4 Capital Boards&#10;    * 35 Resource Tokens&#10;    * 60 Damage Tokens&#10;    * 4 Burning Tokens&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Battle Pack Expansion Cycles:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        &#10;1) The Corruption Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Skavenblight Threat&#10;    Path of the Zealot&#10;    Tooth and Claw&#10;    The Deathmaster's Dance&#10;    The Warpstone Chronicles&#10;    Arcane Fire&#10;&#10;&#10;2) The Enemy Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Burning of Derricksburg&#10;    The Fall of Karak Grimaz&#10;    The Silent Forge&#10;    Redemption of a Mage&#10;    The Fourth Waystone&#10;    Bleeding Sun&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;3) The Morrslieb Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Omens of Ruin&#10;    The Chaos Moon&#10;    The Twin Tailed Comet&#10;    Signs in the Stars&#10;    The Eclipse of Hope&#10;    Fiery Dawn&#10;&#10;&#10;4) The Capital Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Inevitable City&#10;    Realm of the Phoenix King&#10;    The Iron Rock&#10;    Karaz-a-Karak&#10;    City of Winter&#10;    The Imperial Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;5) The Bloodquest Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Rising Dawn&#10;    Fragments of Power&#10;    The Accursed Dead&#10;    Vessel of the Winds&#10;    Portent of Doom&#10;    Shield of the Gods&#10;&#10;&#10;6) The Eternal War Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Days of Blood&#10;    Oaths of Vengeance&#10;    Battle for the Old World&#10;    Glory of Days Past&#10;    The Ruinous Hordes&#10;    Faith and Steel          &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;7) Deluxe Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Assault on Ulthuan&#10;    March of the Damned&#10;    Legends&#10;    Cataclysm&#10;    Hidden Kingdoms&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",
