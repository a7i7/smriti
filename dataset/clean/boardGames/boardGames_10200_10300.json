If they end their movement in a space with a ghost, they fight that ghost by rolling a fight die. If they roll the matching symbol, they remove the ghost from the game board.

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)&#10;&#10;Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.&#10;&#10;Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.&#10;&#10;Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America.

(You can imagine an overhead chop, rather than a sweep around him.) Each fighter also keeps track of his wrath using the Wrath Track. Wrath can be spent to make actions, and is usually accrued when fighters are wounded &ndash; injury cards, which are received when combatants are damaged, affect wrath in this way.&#10;&#10;Wrath also has an effect on who goes first, because the angrier fighters are, the more chance there is they will act first! Each turn, fighters put in a number of initiative cards equal to their wrath (each player has a unique design of initiative card), then the top initiative card is turned over, dictating who will act. After that player has made an action, the next initiative card is turned over, and so on and so forth.&#10;&#10;",

Be it at the brothel or at the market, men such as the Pope or the Emperor can be seen hard at work at any time of the day. Even the most miserable miser, though, would be well advised to also strive to get hold of enough precious stones and wine to make sufficient donations towards the Lord's cathedrals. After all, it is through pious generosity that a poor soul can gain the all-important letters of indulgence and be pardoned for a life of greed and lust. When all is said done, what matters is to have sinned just enough to have achieved all goals and gotten away with it, while others took the fall.&#10;&#10;In more detail, to win, players have to end the game with their &quot;poor souls&quot; closer to heaven's gate than their opponents. Alas, throughout the game these poor souls pretty much exclusively move in the opposite direction, i.e., towards Hell. Only at the very end of the game might players climb back towards heaven, depending on the letters of indulgence that they managed to collect up to that point.&#10;&#10;The accumulation of these letters of indulgence is each player's primary goal. To this end, they take on the roles of different people: the Pope, the Emperor, the Merchant, or the Little Sinner. Each round, these roles in turn grant them access to different special actions. On their turn, players buy or sell goods on the market, visit the brothel to benefit from personal connections, or secretly donate money and goods to the church. Meanwhile, the construction of the game's three cathedrals proceeds. As soon as a cathedral is fully erected, the church will hand out the all-important letters of indulgence. However, only those who have donated the most in either of three categories will actually receive anything.&#10;&#10;Many perks that can be used during the game require the players to &quot;sin&quot;. Sins are tracked by means of a tally stick and will move the player's poor soul closer to hell. The player who strikes the right balance and picks the right roles at the right time will be able to collect the most valuable letters of indulgence and might stand chance at winning the game.

They praise their king Balor, who reigns from his fortifications in the north with an iron fist. Old paths and ruins spread over the island's face, which will be called Ireland many generations from now. But new tribes arrive at the island striving for permanent presence. Who will control &Eacute;rin's fate over the next centuries to come?&#10;&#10;Each player in The Arrival represents a tribe leader who tries to gain predominance over the mythical island of &Eacute;rin while pushing back the demon-like Fomori. But the players are facing a dilemma, for spreading too quickly means becoming more and more corrupt and strengthening the Fomori in their power...&#10;&#10;Over 4-6 rounds, the players determine their resources by means of a unique game mechanism, which will be used later on profitably. During a first phase (Earning Phase), players draw four cards, each showing three sections of different resources. Two of these sections are gradually blocked by the player, thus leaving one section. The resources shown on this section are the ones the player gets. During this phase, they have to decide which section is the best one; while the upper section of the cards offers many resources, it also results in unwanted Corruption Points. The middle and the lower sections offer fewer resources, but also less Corruption.&#10;&#10;After that, the Action Phase takes place and the players must use their resources wisely while having the choice from different kinds of actions in order to get Fame Points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a certain number of rounds have been played or somebody reaches the corruption limit.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the one with the highest amount of Fame Points or the one with the fewest Corruption Points. This depends on the scene of the board at the end: Do the tribes (players) control more locations on &Eacute;rin than the Fomori do &mdash; or is it the other way around?&#10;&#10;",

Negotiate, bluff, forge alliances, threaten your rivals &mdash; use every tool at your disposal to spread your influence, establish supremacy, and claim the ultimate prize: the Iron Throne!&#10;&#10;In more detail, each turn centers around the resolution of an encounter between two players. These encounters can result in hostilities, startling conquests, and the spread of influence, or they can result in the formation of temporary alliances. And though only two players in any encounter will be the &quot;active&quot; players, your friends might offer you their support &mdash; or turn around and offer it to someone else.&#10;&#10;The encounters of The Iron Throne resolve quickly, but they are full of opportunities for cunning strategy, devious intrigues, and brokered alliances. Each features a challenger and a defender, and after these players assign characters to resolve the encounter on the behalf of their Houses, other players may offer their support to either side. In this way, an encounter that starts as a contest between the Lannisters and the Starks may escalate and draw in the support of the Tyrells or other Houses.&#10;&#10;However, there's more to the encounters of The Iron Throne than this initial jostling for power, even with all the alliances and betrayals it can entail. There are still schemes within schemes, and the bluffs, negotiations, and hidden information that color these encounters as the active players discuss the House cards they intend to play. Of course, there's a very good chance that one or both of them may be lying, but they can offer and even agree to a truce. Or they can bid cards from their hands, hoping to win hostilities with the higher total power.&#10;&#10;In the event of a truce, the active players discuss what they may give each other in order to maintain the peace. In the event of hostilities, however, one side will win, and the other will suffer. You might seize influence or take hostages, or you may even have your characters put to the sword.&#10;&#10;Win enough of these encounters, though &mdash; and find the right ones to lose &mdash; and you might find yourself in position to seize the Iron Throne. The goal of the game is to spread five of your influence to your opponents' House cards and take the crown for yourself.&#10;&#10;",

One of those is designated the secret subject and one player becomes the &quot;Gooseberry&quot;.  The Gooseberry does not know which of the sixteen subjects is the secret and the other players do not know who is the Gooseberry.  The goal of the Gooseberry is to remain hidden and figure out the secret subject while all the other players are trying to keep the secret hidden and find the Gooseberry.&#10;&#10;A code card is dealt to each player, with one player receiving the Gooseberry card that has no code. Players use the code to identify the correct subject word. Everyone prepares in their mind a ONE WORD clue related to the secret subject.  The challenge is to choose a clue that shows other players that you know the secret subject but is not so obvious that it reveals the secret to the Gooseberry.  When all players have prepared their clue and are ready, each player, in clockwise order and without hesitation, says out loud the clue they have prepared.&#10;&#10;Players may now discuss, question and accuse each other.  When ready everyone votes on who they think is the Gooseberry. The Gooseberry wins if either they are not correctly identified or if they can guess the correct subject word.&#10;&#10;The rules are currently only available in English. But the cards are universal (no language) and due to the low complexity of the game it's easy to play in any language.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, they get the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your die (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of his city on future turns.

Between them, there is a row of eight gift cards. Each player holds five hand cards and three &ldquo;bo(h)nus cards&rdquo; with secret objectives. Playing the bean duel, you have the option of planting more than one type of bean in the same field, but when you plant a different bean than the one you&rsquo;ve planted before, it has to have the next highest number than the one before. When harvesting your beans, it&rsquo;s the beanometer of the last card you&rsquo;ve planted that counts.&#10;At the start of each turn, the active player plants two beans from their hand and turns over bean cards as usual. Instead of trading, however, they offer their opponent one bean as a gift by pushing this bean type&rsquo;s gift card in their direction. The other player can accept the gift or decline it, but if they don&rsquo;t take it, they have to offer a gift in return. You are allowed to bluff, but it may cost you if your bluff is called! Important: Only the first player to accept a gift actually receives the bean card in question. After this exchange, plant all beans you have received and turned over, then draw new cards.&#10;&ldquo;Bo(h)nus&rdquo; cards can be fulfilled at any time when the required combination of beans printed on the card can be found in any bean field.

What the crew finds instead is something they never expected: a dangerous parasitic organism has somehow made its way into the ship and inside the body of one of the crew members!&#10;&#10;Just as the bio-organism contamination alarm goes off, one of the crew members seizes the chaotic moment and sabotages the freighter's engines. The ship, its crew, and the parasitic organism are all on a collision course with planet Earth, where further contamination of the world's population awaits.&#10;&#10;Which of the crew are dedicated company personnel wanting the alien organism to reach Earth? Which are just crew wanting to identify the infected crew member? Most importantly, which member of the crew is infected?! Join the crew of Burke's Gambit on a wild space adventure with hidden affiliations and a hidden infected player.&#10;&#10;In Burke's Gambit, players take on specific roles of Captain, Marine, Comms Officer and more as they take turns and roll a die. The possibilities of the die include damaging another player, healing themselves, looking at a crew affiliation card, or even scanning a player's diagnostic card. But if you roll an engine power up, you hasten the ship's arrival to Earth. When Burke's Gambit reaches Earth, a vote must be held to eject someone from the airlock (assuming anyone's left)!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Spaghetti is a dexterity game in which players compete to pull out as many valuable spaghetti noodles as possible. There are 27 noodles on the plate that vary in colors, length and points:&#10;&#10;&#10;    10 natural = 1 vp &#10;    8 tomato = 2 vp&#10;    6 spinach = 3 vp&#10;    3 sepia = 4 vp&#10;&#10;&#10;A player has only twenty seconds to collect the best pieces, but eating spaghetti requires great care. If anything falls off the plate and stains the table, the player's turn ends immediately. A player can use only one hand and can touch only one noodle at a time at one point. If pulling a noodle causes a meatball to start rolling off the plate, the player can drop the noodle to try to catch the meatball. At the moment the meatball is grabbed, it cannot be touching any noodles on the plate. These skillfully caught meatballs are worth one point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the plate is empty, with no pasta and no meatballs, and whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;There are two additional difficulty levels: Spaghetti Difficili and Spaghetti Superiori.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Spaghetti Difficili differs from the basic game in the number of meatballs (now four) and the size of plate on which spaghetti is served (players choose a small one).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In Spaghetti Superiori, players earn extra points for fulfilling Italian recipes. There are 12 recipe tokens in total, each shows spaghetti ingredients. Players must remove those ingredients to claim the token. A player must get all of a token's ingredients during a single 20-second turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Capital",
        "description": "Warsaw is a unique city. It is said that it &quot;survived its own death&quot;, and there is truth in this. Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process. Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings. Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance. Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay. Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination. Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is. Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined. Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.&#10;&#10;In Capital, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times. Each player creates their own district of the city. At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners. After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs. During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player. Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table. All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank.&#10;     Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.&#10;&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile. Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely. As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers. A player's district can never be larger than a 3&times;4 or 4&times;3 rectangle of tiles. Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings. Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other. They also occupy an entire tile.&#10;&#10;During the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points.&#10;&#10;",
