        "description": "This game was originally published by the designer as Bin'Fa under the company name Taoist Arts, Inc. It was released a few years later as Hexagony by Avalon Hill, and then again as Bin'Fa by the designer under the company name Kenterprises. The Avalon Hill version has slightly different rules. Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.&#10;&#10;Bin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Bin&rsquo;Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.&#10;&#10;The game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.&#10;&#10;The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.&#10;&#10;Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.&#10;&#10;The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times. Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese general and student of warfare. Bin&acute;Fa is based on the precepts contained in his classic work on the subject, &quot;The Art of War,&quot; written 2,300 years ago. They provide the structural framework for the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "The Republic of Rome",
        "description": "The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history.  It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!&#10;&#10;Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to governor provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.&#10;&#10;",

Words may be formed horizontally or vertically on the grid, as in Scrabble, but as the title suggests the letters may also be stacked, so already-played words can be changed into different words by having letters stacked (up to a limit of 5 high). EXAMPLE: Change LATE to CATER and then change CATER to BELATED. Scoring is different from Scrabble; there are no prescribed letter values per tile; instead, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted and used as the score as follows: A word that is flat (no stacked tiles) scores 2 points per tile, but the words that score the most are those that have many stacked tiles, with tiles underneath the spelled word also being counted. The impact of these rules provide for scoring-per-turn increasing as the game continues.&#10;&#10;Winning Moves classic 8x8 version: &#10;http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Moves-1194-Classic-Upwords/dp/B00V82MFSY?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=upwords&amp;qid=1464366613&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1&#10;&#10;Hasbro Euro 10x10 version:&#10;http://www.amazon.com/Upwords-The-3D-Word-Building-Game/dp/B01276CYHQ?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=upwords&amp;qid=1464366613&amp;ref_=sr_ph_1&amp;sr=sr-1&#10;&#10;August 2016 will have a new Hasbro version 10x10 game available in the United States.&#10;&#10;An app for UPWORDS play is available both for iphone and android devices, by Lonely Star Software, under license from Hasbro.

The game was created by Jim Barnes who sold the game at a booth that he set up at Indy and other race track promenades in the 1970s. Mr. Barnes struck a deal with Avalon Hill and the game was changed a little by the development team at AH and published with the SI logo on the box.  On an oval track you can run up to 33 cars. Each car has its own driver card derived from the performance of the actual drivers of the featured Indy race. Ongais, Foyt, Unser, Sneva, Mears, Rutherford etc, every driver that was in the that year's Indy has a card with a color photo on one side and game racing charts on the other side.  One Card set, for an even year Indy race from 1978 through 1986, was included in the box with the other card sets offered through the AH mail order program.&#10;&#10;Each driver card has 6 tables on the back. Three of the tables for movement, you chose whether you are going to drive normally, charge or back off and then roll 2 dice, referencing the appropriate table. The result will tell you how far you can move or if you have encountered car trouble. There are 2 trouble tables that can slow you down or knock you out of the race. There is also a pit stop table which controls how many turns you must sit in the pits before re-entering the race.&#10;&#10;The game is driven on Stats and can be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;",

The players do this by Trading, Buying, and Leaping with other cards.&#10;&#10;Monad / Die 1. Million uses a deck of cards with six colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple). Half of these are called &quot;Warm&quot; colors (Red, Orange, and Yellow), and the others are &quot;Cool&quot; colors (Green, Blue, and Purple). The majority of cards has one symbol on them (known as &quot;Commons&quot;), but there is one card of each color with 2-5 colors on them (known as &quot;Bis,&quot; &quot;Tris,&quot; &quot;Quads,&quot; and &quot;Quints&quot;). At the start of the game, each player is assigned one of the six colors as their &quot;identity&quot; and is dealt six Commons and one &quot;Bonus&quot; card (which shows three pairs of colors). The Bis, Tris, Quads, and Quints are placed face up in separate piles in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player attempts to get higher numbered cards into their hand. The easiest way is by &quot;Trading.&quot; To trade, a player turns in a pair of cards with the same number of symbols but of opposite colors (one warm and one cool) and takes the top card from the stack with the next highest number of symbols. When they turn in two Quints, they gain a Monad. If the two cards turned in match one of the pairs on their bonus card, they may also draw the top card from each of the lower stacks. They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.&#10;&#10;The player can turn in more than two cards and &quot;Leap&quot; to a higher stack. This allows them to select a card with a higher number of symbols. Finally, they can &quot;Buy&quot; a card. Buying cards uses the numbers located on each card. The player turns in a number of cards which total greater than the number on the card they are after. Monads can be purchased for 80 points.&#10;&#10;A player can also draw the top card from the deck but doing so prevents them from taking any other action that turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate a given number of Monads (which varies depending on the number of players in the game) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Depending upon the number of players, each player receives 1 or 2 knights.  Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.&#10;&#10;In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.&#10;&#10;The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).&#10;&#10;The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.  There are also potential bonuses which add to the players' scores.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The premise is quite simple: jump out of airplanes and get your guys to land as close to the coast as possible. The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. &#10;The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.&#10;&#10;Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.&#10;&#10;When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!&#10;&#10;Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "BattleTech is a science fiction tactical wargame in which players maneuver giant fighting robots (&quot;BattleMechs,&quot; or &quot;'Mechs&quot;) against each other (or vehicles and/or infantry). The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). 'Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own 'Mechs from scratch. The base game (reprinted in many different editions) includes an introductory rulebook for new players; recent editions also include quick-start rules for an even faster orientation. The game is typically played on one or more mapsheets or (more recently) mounted map boards, and there are many mapsheet and &quot;hex&quot; (mounted-board) packs available for purchase or even download. Optional rules are also available for hexless play a la many miniatures games. An extensive line of pewter figurines ('Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available in the United States from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure lines in Europe.)&#10;&#10;The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of core rulebooks, the central one being Total Warfare (in print and PDF), which contains the main (tournament-legal) rules for the game. (The 2011 Catalyst reprint is up-to-date in terms of errata fixes.) TechManual (in print and PDF) contains construction rules for 'Mechs and other units. A series of three &quot;advanced rules&quot; books adds on to the standard rules: Tactical Operations (in print and PDF) covers on-planet actions over a period of hours; Strategic Operations (in print and PDF) covers in-system actions over a period of weeks; and Interstellar Operations (forthcoming; 2012?) covers system-level actions over a period of months. The final core rulebook available is A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG (in print and PDF), a revised version of the BattleTech RPG rules, which have previously gone under the names MechWarrior and Classic BattleTech RPG. A one-volume tome on the BattleTech universe was announced years ago but has no scheduled release.&#10;&#10;BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on 'Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history; map sets, including the new Hex Pack hard-mounted maps with tile overlays; sourcebooks; and pregenerated record sheets, as well as the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).&#10;&#10;As in earlier editions of BattleTech, the current generation includes an introductory box set.

Beyond Balderdash adds several new categories to the mix:  Movies (make up a plot), Dates (say what happened on it), People (say what the person did), and Initials (make up what they stand for).  The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs.&#10;&#10;The UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.  Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a &quot;Law&quot; category, where you complete the law given on the card. Beyond Balderdash is lacking that category, and features in its place a &quot;Date&quot; category, where you are given a date and must come up with the historical significance.  The Canadian and Australian versions of Absolute Balderdash also feature the Date category instead of Law.&#10;&#10;Absolute and Beyond were merged into the game Balderdash at least by 2003 (there is a 1997 edition of Beyond Balderdash still with the Dates category).

The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o MX-1, was released in Brazil.

Because the situation is forever changing, there is no single best strategy; however,players must weigh risks against gains with every decision they make and good judgment will pay off.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a mapboard showing Africa from Khartoum to Capetown and Lagos to Mombasa. The periphery of this map, showing the territory known ca. 1820, is filled-in; the center is blank. A hexagonal grid is superimposed on the map to regulate movement and to delimit territory explored. In the course of play, each player moves a token (representing his explorer) from explored hexagons to blank hexagons one at a time.; terrain, native tribes and other discoveries within the hexagons are then semi-randomly determined, with allowance made for previous discoveries in adjacent hexagons. The player interacts with the discoveries (e.g. negotiates with new natives for guides) and records them on the mapboard using wax crayons. The mapboard surface is erasable. If the explorer dies before returning to Europe to publish his discoveries, all hexagons which only he has explored will be erased and &quot;subsequent explorers will find that his discoveries were only rumors&quot;; i.e., when other players explore the erased hexagons later they will have to generate new discoveries there.&#10;&#10;When explorers do return to civilization, however, they may publish their discoveries, after which they are safe from erasure. Players may also emulate real explorers by withholding some of their discoveries since they will enjoy some advantages when moving through terrain or dealing with natives known only to them. Points are scored for discoveries as they are published and once scored will not be lost if the explorer dies or is retired by his player. A player may retire his explorer at any time and then start a new explorer in Europe.&#10;&#10;Before each trip to Africa, explorers will have to raise money to support their expedition. New explorers with no discoveries to their credit must do this by drawing chance cards for several turns until they feel their finances are adequate. Experienced explorers can accelerate this process by publishing discoveries, which allow them to draw additional chance cards.&#10;&#10;Originally published by Discovery Games and re-published by Avalon Hill as a more card-based rather than dice-based system.

During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world&rsquo;s best to the world&rsquo;s worst.&#10;&#10;Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the &quot;cool stuff&quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply and transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army.

From the rulebook&#10;&#10;&quot;Streaming through the mysterious stargates, the power-hungry Virunian forces have wracked the Milky Way for nearly 80 years in the War of Purification.  Remnants of the civilizations devastated by the Virunian Tri-Ships, banded together in a determined coalition, awaited the moment to launch their counter-stroke.  In 2519 AD, the moment had arrived: the Virunians encounter their nemesis and, retreating headlong to the source of their power, find themselves dispersed and without their potent unified command.  Coalition telepaths, sensing the Virunian confusion, direct their forces to the Nullgate, arriving just as the first helpless Virunian vessels tumble forth from the stargates.  The battle to ensue will decide the Virunian fate in the galaxy.  StarGate re-creates this climatic battle using a stylized, semi-abstract system of movement that allows combatants to conceal themselves from one another in the various planes and dimensions created by the Nullgate.  Players use cardboard playing pieces, representing units of the Virunian and Coalition forces, to maneuver and engage in combat.  Simple probability charts reveal the outcome of combat and various game functions.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.&#10;&#10;The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed Corporation player then takes their turn with both Doomtroopers and the next Corporation token is flipped.  Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).  After all Corporations have taken their turns it is the Dark Legion players turn.&#10;&#10;The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.&#10;&#10;Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.&#10;&#10;A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.

        "description": "Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.&#10;&#10;- Warhammer Quest Contents -&#10;&#10;    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard&#10;    6 Orc Warrior models&#10;    6 Orc Archer models&#10;    6 Goblin Spearmen models&#10;    6 Night Goblin Archer models&#10;    12 Skaven models&#10;    3 Minotaur models&#10;    12 Giant Spider models&#10;    12 Giant Bat models&#10;    12 Giant Rat models&#10;    12 Snotling models&#10;    10 Dungeon Doorways&#10;    32 Page Rule Book&#10;    16 Page Adventure Book&#10;    192 Page Role-play Book&#10;    1 How to Play sheet&#10;    50 Page Adventure Record Pad&#10;    19 Event Cards&#10;    23 Dungeon Cards&#10;    30 Treasure Cards&#10;    17 Blank Event Cards&#10;    15 Spell Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Cards&#10;    4 Battle-level Cards&#10;    4 Equipment Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Counters&#10;    6 Dungeon Rooms&#10;    5 Objective Rooms&#10;    7 Corridors&#10;    1 Steps&#10;    3 T-junctions&#10;    1 Corner&#10;    1 Portcullis Marker&#10;    1 Cave-in Marker&#10;    3 Pit of Despair Markers&#10;    6 Webbed Counters&#10;    15 Power Tokens&#10;    10 Luck Counters&#10;    18 Scenery Markers&#10;    6 Large Dice &amp; 12 Small Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players start from Home Port as merchants and set out on a trading voyage. By throwing the die, they sail to exotic ports like the Pearl Coast, the Jewel Coast and the Spice Islands. When they arrive at a port they pay a trading fee and draw a card which tells them what cargo they have bought. Cargoes range from codfish and coal to precious spices, pearls and diamonds,!&#10;&#10;Players might also draw a pirate card while trading. They then have to decide whether to rob other players - or continue as honest merchants. Players could also draw a warship card - in which case any pirate who attacks them or anyone else nearby will be in for a nasty shock! The top card in each player&rsquo;s pack shows whether they are merchants, pirates or warships. Since they don&rsquo;t show each other their cards - no-one really knows what they are (until someone decides to turn pirate by attacking another ship).&#10;&#10;Players who are robbed can get their revenge by calling in the Navy and chasing the pirate down before he or she can reach Home Port! Things are made even more exciting by the &lsquo;Treasure Chest&rsquo; cards which players draw every time they roll a &lsquo;one&rsquo;. They then find out whether they have landed without any wind in the doldrums, - or been blown by a hurricane to a distant port, - or have found buried treasure - or other such twists of fortune!'&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "FROM the SESSION REPORT:&#10;&#10;Each player is competing to pull off the most lucrative scams. You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.&#10;&#10;Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.&#10;&#10;You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.&#10;&#10;Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.&#10;&#10;To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.&#10;&#10;",

However, aside from the artwork and the piece names, the game only bears a superficial resemblance to either the movie or Tolkien's works.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a character from the Fellowship. The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions. Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.&#10;&#10;Die rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains. A special die tells players how many turns they will be bogged down in a mountain space once they enter it.&#10;&#10;Card and Ring management afford strategy opportunities, while the rules remain simple enough (and the game quick enough) to allow the game to be played by a wide variety of ages. Despite its divergence from the main story, the game itself offers a measure of challenge that makes it enjoyable - far more so than it would have been as a simple &quot;roll-and-move&quot; game with a strict adherence to the movie or book theme.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.  On the plus side, there's a lot of player interaction as your profession gets called upon or when you pass your cigarettes to another.&#10;&#10;Smokers Wild seems related to Drinkers Wild so it may have been originally published by Gamma Two.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Drinkers Wild&#10;    Lovers Wild&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard. The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.&#10;&#10;For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.&#10;&#10;One optional element in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a &quot;claw-marked&quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).&#10;&#10;",
