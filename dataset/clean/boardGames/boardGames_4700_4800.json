Scores aren't tallied until the end of the game, because at any time, earthquakes can occur, destroying tiles along the most-built direction leading out from the central &quot;San Andreas&quot; tile.

Simple but effective rules allow you to use your mechanized forces to blitz the enemy's front line and exploit deep into your opponent's rear. Can you as the Soviets survive the slashing Panzer attacks of Operation Barbarossa and Case Blue in 1941 and 1942? Can you as the Axis player stand against the crushing Soviet Deep Battle operations that destroyed Army Group Center in 1944? Stalin's War will test both player's operational skills to the limit.&#10;&#10;But there is more to Stalin's War than directing your forces on the map. Both sides have their own deck of 55 cards, needed to launch offensive operations, mobilize their forces, replace losses, introduce new weapons, and deal with the larger strategic context of a World at War. Card Events include combat leaders, weapons (from German Tiger Tanks to patriotic Soviet mice nibbling the electrical wiring of the panzers), the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, Manstein's Backhand Blow, Stalin's and Hitler's meddling, the Battle of the Bulge, and much more.&#10;&#10;Stalin's War allows players to combine the best of WWII operational play with the strategic depth and tactical chrome of a card driven design.

At the beginning the wind blows from the upwind buoy (North) towards the downwind gate (South).&#10;&#10;The boats have to perform 7 electrifying starting moves, exit the downwind gate and sail 3 times upwards and 3 times downwind, moving thanks to the wind, but looking out for falls, gusts and changes of wind direction.&#10;&#10;With a precise game strategy and applying the overlap rules and wind shadows&rsquo; tactics, the best player or players (it is possible to play forming crews) will be the first to cross the finishing line and win the yearned for sailing cup.&#10;&#10;To learn to sail through its simple yet ingenious rules means to get on board, to hoist the sails and maneuver the boat as for real, experiencing a series of exciting and unforgettable challenges.&#10;&#10;The alternative name listed, Velagiochiamo, was a prototype by Saverio Robberto and Domenico Troia, the authors.

An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target.&#10;&#10;Description&#10;&#10;In StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and &quot;Z-Axis&quot; connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).&#10;&#10;Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.&#10;&#10;Each turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects.&#10;&#10;Players can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms. Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck. This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use.&#10;&#10;&quot;Reimplements&quot;&#10;&#10;     StarCraft (video game)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "On Sunday, 7 December 1941, the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, was attacked by Japanese aircraft. For the next four years, Allied task forces engaged elements of the Imperial Japanese fleet throughout the ocean. Marines and army units began their program of island-hopping, wresting from the Japanese the empire that they had expanded in every direction.&#10;&#10;War in the Pacific is a multi-level simulation of the Pacific theater of operations during World War II. The game enables players to recreate the entire course of the war, form the opening Japanese attack on 7 December, 1941 to the climatic Allied assaults in the closing days of 1945. Representing some 30% of the globe, the strategic maps let players move and engage in combat on all levels: air, ground and naval. War in the Pacific is not a simple game; there are a number of rules and concepts that will, at first, be unfamiliar to a majority of players. But playing through smaller map sections and scenarios enables the player to become familiar with the mechanics of the game.&#10;&#10;This is a reprint edition which substantially expanded the original's components.  Components: 7 full size (22 x 34&quot;) strategic maps in full color, new tactical maps with nearly 338 individual islands for new ground units to fight over, 32 die-cut counter sheets, nearly 9,000 counters showing all types of units from the Pacific Theater, rule books, chart books and assorted displays and player aid charts&#10;&#10;The rules have undergone significant change with greatly increased emphasis on detail  in combat while removing the detailed logistics system that was the focus of the old game and replacing it with a command point system modeled after Victory Games' &quot;Pacific War.&quot;&#10;&#10;The order of battle is significantly more detailed. Leaders on many levels (and whose combat performance may be unpredictable), often serve to limit players' ability to affect the outcome of every battle to the Nth degree. A player's assignment of the right task force commander (for the right force at the right time), may spell the difference between a tactical victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;The ground combat system has been completely revised, substituting a step-loss system adapted from VG's &quot;Pacific War.&quot; Pitched battles on islands and atolls are now resolved, including maneuver, on expanded tactical maps in six different scales, rather than simply being abstractly represented in a single hex on the strategic maps.&#10;&#10;War in the Pacific's original air and naval systems are retained, in their essence, albeit with substantial modifications and above all added chrome in combat. Thus the game still feels like the original in those two aspects.&#10;&#10;The game comes with the grand campaign and some small introductory battle scenarios.&#10;&#10;Booklets:&#10;&#10;    Rulebook I (rule 1.0 to 25.0)&#10;    Rulebook II (rule 26.0 to 62.0)&#10;    Scenarios &amp; Campaign reinforcements&#10;    Examples of Play, Optional Rules &amp; Designer's Notes&#10;    Chartbook I&#10;    Chartbook II&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players battle to win the down by playing the strongest hand.&#10;&#10;Game play combines elements of classic playing card games to simulate the action on the field. Players must decide how best to play their cards. For instance, cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, three-of-a-kind, or five-card poker-style 'Power Hands'. Much like a football coach deciding what play to call, or the quarterback choosing his best option, players must decide whether to play strong card(s) immediately, or to hold back in hopes of using it to put together a stronger hand.&#10;&#10;Other elements of Card Football include team and player chips, game board, a score board, a referee/yard marker and dice that are used for fumble, field goal and injury situations.&#10;&#10;Card Football allows for one, two, three and four-player modes. The single-player game mode is set up so that an individual can take on 'the system' and pick up the basics of the game before challenging friends in an all-out gridiron battle. In addition, the learning curve with Card Football is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned in two to five minutes, or after a few series of downs.&#10;&#10;If it happens on the field, you'll find it in Card Football. From field goals, punts and extra points, to fumbles, interceptions and last-second heroics, you get it all in four quarters of Card Football action.&#10;&#10;",

The first volume is devoted to campaigns between Agnadello (1509) and Pavia (1525)&#10;&#10;All began after reading Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Art of War in Italy 1494-1529&rdquo;, London, 1920. Soon that period looked extremely interesting to us and nearly neglected by the wargame community.&#10;Our intent was to generate any interest, among &ldquo;aficionados&rdquo; and historians, about that ancient era, when the first applications of modern strategy in the art of war took place.&#10;&#10;This is the time of charges of cavalrymen with the finest gliding armors; of the first use of fire arms and artillery (with some effect); sieges, mercenary troops, treachery, pillaging and all that &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; that may enlighten a wargame.&#10;&#10;Those campaigns were led to bring to &ldquo;the battle&rdquo;, which was often decisive, we decided to bring in a detailed sequence of the main battle (said &ldquo;Major Battle&rdquo;). So in the game, there are three kinds of battle: Major Battle, Skirmish and Siege with the Major Battle involving different tactics played by each side.&#10;&#10;The map represents Lombardy in the XVIth century and the neighbors states. The sources for the maps were new books and old manuscripts and maps, among which a manuscript dated 1520 (!), regarding the state of the roads in the area between Lodi and Piacenza.&#10;Many books have been written about this subject and I think we have read the most important ones.&#10;&#10;We had to make a selection of all those campaigns fought in Italy during the Italian Wars. The five campaigns we have included are:&#10;- Agnadello 1509, Venice defends its Republic against the foes. &#10;- Novara 1513, the Swiss against the French army. The last triumph of the Swiss.&#10;- Marignano 1515, Fran&ccedil;ois I grabs the Duchy of Milan from the Swiss&#10;- Bicocca 1522, the French lose the Duchy of Milan&#10;- Pavia 1525, Fran&ccedil;ois I loses the largest battle and Milan to the Empire&#10;&#10;Game Highlights:&#10;&#10;     new game system, operational-level, devoted to warfare in the XVIth century campaigns&#10;     highly interactive sequence of play, focused on maneuver and careful planning&#10;     various forms of combat: Major Battles, Skirmishes, Sieges&#10;     set of Exclusive Rules and specific rules and events for each campaign&#10;     a 22&quot; x 34&quot; fine-art map , reproducing a part of XVIth northern Italy, based on an accurate study of ancient maps and sources&#10;     gorgeous iconic counters representing all the main Capitani who fought there and the different combat units&#10;     detailed (as it is possible) order of battle, with combat units differentiated by strength, maximum movement, quality and reliability&#10;     very low counter density and limited play time&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.&#10;&#10;But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &ndash; like on earth &ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.&#10;&#10;Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches.

The game includes 15 different mysteries for players to solve and uses some clever tools that players must employ to solve the mysteries. An instructional DVD that explains the game and shows an example mystery being solved is also included.&#10;&#10;There are 2 phases to the game. In the first phase players roll and move their pieces around the board to visit various sites to look at clue cards so they can figure out the mystery phrase first. Each of these clues require a different mechanism to solve. Some use a mirror to reverse the letters, some use a decoder box that is laid over the card in a certain way to reveal part of the mystery phrase, some cards you line up against a special decoder tool, and some are just riddles or puzzles to solve. Some clues will also require the player to do to the center of the board and visit the library to retrieve a card there with information that will help them solve their clue. Alternately, players might need to visit the Louvre and examine a painting there. When the players visit the Louvre the players only have 30 seconds to find the correct card with the painting that relates to their clue, examine the painting and the information on the card about the painting and hopefully discover the information they need to solve their current clue.&#10;&#10;Players can also discover one of two special types of cards: Taxis which let the player move around board quicker and a computer card that lets you look at another player's notes for 30 seconds.&#10;&#10;Once one player thinks they have solved the Mystery Phrase they go to the center of the board and announce the answer. If they are right then all players score 1 point for each letter (and blank space) they had correct in the Mystery Phrase. The player that got the Mystery Phrase correct gets 5 bonus points.&#10;&#10;This begins Phase 2 of the game as 5 questions are now read from the mystery book. These questions relate to the clues that the players discovered during the game. Each question a player gets right is worth 5 points. If a player gets all 5 questions correct they score another 5 points.&#10;&#10;Players lose points for any Taxi or Computer cards they had left in their hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

If you're not fast enough, someone else will move something, messing up your plans.&#10;&#10;The game has been illustrated by St&#195;&#169;phane Poinsot.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Here's a strange merry go round!  Its wooden horses, joking and mocking, have come to life and nothing can stop them for turning in any direction!  If you want to ride, you'll have to catch them!&#10;&#10;To play Carrousel, you don't have to be a knight, jockey or a cossack.  A little speed and observation will do.  Find the right color combinations and move your horses quickly before your opponents do it for you!&#10;&#10;Carrousel is a game of speed and observation by Max Gerchambeaux who, when he's not cooking one of the best cassoulets in Paris in his restaurant, invents smart games for the whole family!&#10;&#10;",

The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated or could have participated.&#10;&#10;Two games included in this issue are: BUDAPEST 1956, covering the ill-fated rebellion in the Hungarian capital in late 1956; and BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA, the clashes between Cuban and South African mechanized forces in Angola in 1987 and 1988.&#10;&#10;There are two players in each game. In BUDAPEST 1956 one player controls the Hungarian Rebels and possible NATO &quot;what-if&quot; reinforcements, the other controls the forces of the Warsaw Pact. In BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA one player controls the South Africans and their UNITA allies, the other the Cuban and MPLA forces.&#10;&#10;In the Budapest game each hexagon on the map represents half a kilometer across, and each game turn represents one day. Soviet maneuver units are mostly battalions, with regiments for their artillery and assault guns; Hungarian rebel units are ad hoc groups; and NATO intervention, when playing that special alternative history scenario, are represented by US &quot;Pentomic&quot; battlegroups.&#10;&#10;In the Angola game each hexagon on the map represents eight kilometers across, while each turn represents anywhere from one week of intensive combat to four weeks of refitting. Units on both sides are mainly battalions or equivalent groups of irregulars.&#10;&#10;The game system is low-complexity (totaling about 13,000 words) and compares to the one used in last year's Middle East Battles: Suez '56 &amp; El Arish '67. There are 280 NATO-style (with some iconic) half-inch counters. Playing time between two experienced opponents of roughly equal skill levels will be about three hours per game.

Walk in the shoes of men such as Churchill, Lawrence of Arabia, Enver, and Falkenhayn.&#10;&#10;The action stretches from India to the Balkans, from the Black Sea to Suez. Can the Germans inspire a Persian uprising or forge an alliance with Afghanistan? Can the Russians capture a warm water port? Can the British guard the oil that fuels the Royal Navy? Can the Turks capture the Suez Canal and spark a revolt in Egypt?&#10;&#10;In Pursuit of Glory you will constantly feel that you're on the razor's edge - on the verge of impending doom or of breakthrough and total victory. Your hand of 7 cards presents you with a rich array of strategic and operational opportunities. You must decide whether to use each card for its historic event, command points, or resources. You must then commit your forces to a variety of objectives: the Turkish-Russian frontier in Caucasia, the violation of neutral Persia, oil-rich Mesopotamia, the Suez Canal, the Balkans and its vital railroads. You must judge when it is right to invade Serbia or launch a new naval invasion (perhaps on the inset map representing Gallipoli).&#10;&#10;As the British, you must hold on while your Russian allies break through the Turkish lines in Caucasia and you bring your forces to bear through invasion and a gradual build-up of imperial might.

Ho Chi Minh had requested cease fire negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, and the French government was looking for a way out that would give them peace with honor. Both sides felt that a &quot;big win&quot; on the battlefield would finally secure at the peace table what they had been unable to obtain in six and a half years of war.&#10;&#10;The site of this battle would be near a village called, in Vietnamese, &quot;Seat of the Border County Prefecture&quot; located in a distant valley of north western Vietnam near the Laotian border. The French high command, under General Henri Navarre, reasoned that such a remote location could not be successfully attacked. General Vo Nguyen Giap thought the position was nearly impossible to defend. The siege of Dien Bien Phu would be the result.&#10;&#10;La vall&eacute;e de la mort (&quot;Death Valley&quot;) is a simulation of this epic siege that ended the French colonial presence in Asia and marked the beginning of a 21 year struggle for national unification.

        "description": "Publishers blurb: &quot;STORM OF STEEL is a complete simulation of World War One. The three maps cover Europe from the Pyrenees to the Urals, plus the Middle East. Fighting rages from St. Petersburg to Verdun to Baghdad and beyond. The maps can be combined for one grand game of the Great War, or they may be used separately for theater-level campaigns of the eastern front, the western front and the Middle East. The game rules use a modular approach, which allows players to employ the level of complexity they desire. Turns are quarterly, but players can use special campaign cards to provide additional move-fight impulses, recreating the intensive offensives of the war. There are scenarios for each year and each front of the war, as well as a grand game for the entire war. There is also a &quot;what if&quot; scenario for the war continuing into 1919.&#10;&#10;Units represent land, naval and air forces. Ground forces are portrayed at corps level. Each corps is rated for the number of divisions it includes; so players can concentrate for the offensive or disperse for the defense. Corps include infantry, shock troops, mountain infantry and cavalry. There are also specialized armored car and tank brigades, as well as tank corps for 1919, plus the planned-for American airborne division. Each country has its own unique order of battle so, for example, the Austro-Hungarians have mountain corps, and there are also additional units representing Bolshevik and independent nationalist forces.&#10;&#10;Naval units are at the squadron level for capital ships, and flotillas for cruisers and destroyers. There is also a complete submarine warfare module for attacks on merchant shipping. Air warfare is represented by strategic and tactical wings. A unique feature of the game is players can improve their aerial warfare capabilities by increasing their air doctrine level. As air doctrine improves, players can employ interception, aerial supply and aircraft carrier operations. On the subversive side, players can utilize agents to conduct propaganda and sabotage operations to undermine their foes from within.&#10;&#10;Land combat uses three different combat results tables to model different tactics. Tank and shock troop units can use the much more effective Infiltration CRT. Naval combat requires opposing fleets to first acquire each other, then engage in gunnery. Lighter fleet units become invaluable for recon and screening, while battleships and battlecruiser squadrons close in for the kill. In the air, players can execute a variety of missions, including air superiority and bombardment.&#10;&#10;An industrial production module gives players the capability to produce different types of forces. Production is tied to morale, and winning great battles will enhance your side's output while a disastrous defeat may lead to strikes on the home front. Storm of Steel uses a card system to generate major operations. Campaign cards give players additional move-fight impulses, combat bonuses and extra reinforcements. Players have to carefully choose which campaigns they will implement because some cards, such as the Schlieffen Plan, will provide for more maneuver, while others, such as Verdun, will enhance combat. There are also cards that will grant tactical innovations such as chemical warfare and armored doctrine, as well as bringing into play leaders such as Hindenburg, Brusilov and Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "1805: Sea of Glory",
        "description": "Spring, 1805&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Grande Armee&rsquo; is encamped along the shores of the English Channel. Following the teachings of Alexander, the French Emperor seeks to defeat a naval power from the land. He has but to place his 200,000 troops on British soil and France&rsquo;s hereditary enemy will finally fall. To do this, his combined fleet must control the Channel long enough for hundreds of shallow draft boats to ferry his troops to England. Standing in the Emperor&rsquo;s way is the Royal Navy.&#10;&#10;The year 1805, which is punctuated by the British naval victory at Trafalgar, represents one of England&rsquo;s darkest times during the Napoleonic Wars. Her great &ldquo;wooden walls&rdquo; offer the island nation its only defense against a far superior foe.&#10;&#10;1805: Sea of Glory examines the naval war on an operational level during that pivotal year. Although Trafalgar shines through history as the beacon of victory, it is the successful blockade of enemy ports that kept French boats from stepping onto British soil. But 1805: Sea of Glory is more than just a game about blockade duty. It is a game of breakout and pursuit, deception and false leads, husbanding meager resources, striking a blow where your enemy least suspects, and bringing about the decisive battle that defines victory or defeat.&#10;&#10;1805: Sea of Glory focuses on the operational actions of the three great navies. The Allied player (France &amp; Spain) must constantly try to break out of numerous European ports and form a combined fleet. The British player must continuously worry about his ships on station, as wind and weather allow the enemy an opening to slip anchor and set sail. For when Napoleon&rsquo;s fleets take flight, the British are hard pressed to cover all the potential targets and bring the enemy to bear. The British player will find that he never has enough frigates to watch all avenues of escape, and that a clever French player can keep him guessing and ultimately win this game of cat and mouse.&#10;&#10;The game uses blocks to represent the fog of war. The ability to spot and intercept your enemy is paramount. But is that block scurrying across the Mediterranean towards Egypt the French fleet? Or has the Toulon squadron turned west towards the Caribbean? From the French perspective, is the block off the coast of Brest a fleet? Or have the British returned home to repair and refit, leaving only a few frigates to watch the port? Is now the moment to sortie? Or does a large enemy force lay just over the horizon?&#10;&#10;While blocks represent fleets, squadrons, and scouting frigates, traditional counters represent the individual ships of the line. Every ship that could have seen duty, from lowly 64 gunners to the massive Santissima Trinidad, is present. Individual ships are kept on off map organizational charts, so that the exact composition of a fleet or squadron block is not known to your opponent until interception takes place.&#10;&#10;The great naval commanders of the age are present in the game as well. Rosily-Mesros, Villeneuve, Ganteaume, Missiessy, and Gravina for the Allied fleets. Cornwallis, Nelson, Calder, Collingwood, and Strachan for the British. Each admiral is rated for his ability to escape or pursue, as well as, his tactical acumen in combat. Special abilities are also included: from Cornwallis&rsquo; skill as an administrator, to Villeneuve&rsquo;s fatalistic bent, to Gravina&rsquo;s charisma, to Nelson&rsquo;s visionary brilliance brought to life as the &ldquo;Nelson Touch&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map covers the North Atlantic from the Channel Coast to Africa, and the Mediterranean from the Straits of Gibraltar to Egyptian shores. An insert map covers the West Indies. Each hex represents 50 nautical miles. An Atlantic transit track handles fleets and squadrons sailing from Europe to the Caribbean and back. The major ports of the three belligerents are shown; each rated for harbor facilities and their effect on a fleet&rsquo;s ability to sortie.&#10;&#10;Weather also plays a huge part in the game. Storms and squalls will blow blockading forces off station, allowing the Allied player the opportunity to escape. While at sea, fleets and squadrons are at the mercy of the wind. True to any age of sail game, fleets may become becalmed at the worst possible moment. Prevailing winds are also noted on the map, resulting in interesting strategic options. A player that learns to anticipate and utilize the game&rsquo;s weather system will have the advantage. Beware being caught at sea in the Windward or Leeward Islands during hurricane season.&#10;&#10;Each individual ship is rated for its firepower and morale. The Allied player will cringe as his Spanish ships strike their colors early in a battle, while the steadfast Jack Tars of the Royal Navy will never seem to falter. But despite their superiority at sea, the British are not invincible, and a shrewd French player will find ways to thwart his enemy. Fire high and disable the British so that you can slip away, or stand hull to hull and exchange broadsides?&#10;&#10;A unique tactical combat system rewards fleets that seize the weather gauge. Each player has a selection of tactics chits which represent flag signals sent to his ships during battle. Choose the right combination of maneuver and sail settings to break the enemy line. Take the leeward position and attempt to escape before the windward fleet can close. Or from the leeward, turn and fight, creating a gauntlet of fire an overly aggressive enemy must endure. A Trafalgar sized battle can be fought out in less than 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;Although the game ends immediately in a French victory if the Allied fleet ever controls the English Channel, there is also a set of variable victory conditions. The British Admiralty must watch out for French invasions of Egypt, Malta, Naples, Ireland, or West Indies islands. The British player will quickly learn that he never has enough ships to cover every potential threat.&#10;&#10;A series of random events rounds out the simulation. Napoleon&rsquo;s meddling, British manpower shortages, West Indies fever, Spanish drafts, favorable winds, and Royalist spies are among some of the events that will hinder or help players achieve victory.&#10;&#10;",

You get all the great action of the game on the ice with NHL Ice Breaker. Game play is built around CSE Games' specially-designed 54-card playing deck (52 standard suited cards plus two Jokers). Each action in NHL Ice Breaker is based on the basic principle of high hand wins. Opponents play their card(s) at the same time to battle for puck possession, and the player with the highest hand gets to execute his/her action indicated on the card(s) played.&#10;&#10;As players win hands, the puck is moved up the ice (game board) and toward the opponent's net. Along the way, players may land on special &ldquo;Ice Breaker&rdquo; squares, which can shift momentum in an instant. Ice Breaker actions include penalties, big hits, turnovers or great passes. Once in the Shooting Zone, it's a classic contest of shooter versus goalie. Did you play your cards right?&#10;&#10;NHL Ice Breaker separates itself from other hockey-based games in that it has a true hockey 'feel'. The game is both accurate and fast-paced. Combining elements of popular card games, players must decide how best to play their cards. Cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, or three-of-a-kind. It is up to the player to decide which cards to play and how to play them.&#10;&#10;The learning curve of NHL Ice Breaker is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned within a couple of minutes, aided by the built-in familiarity that the playing deck offers. NHL Ice Breaker is designed for one to four players, ages eight (8) and up.&#10;&#10;For more information, check out www.csegames.com.&#10;&#10;",

The unexpected and dogged resistance of the Republican Army, which was fully involved in a deep reorganization, caused the failure of this offensive, forcing the Nationalists to give up trying to storm the capital and making them take the long road by capturing the whole country before being able to declare themselves victorious.&#10;&#10;After the failure of Franco's Nationalist troops to surround and conquer Madrid during the first months of the Spanish Civil War, Spain looked doomed to a long war of attrition.  During this gloomy period, a new force made its appearance -- the motorized Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV).  Lavishly equipped and overconfident after its first successful performance in the fall of Malaga, the Italians thought they could quickly and easily end the war.  Spain was not Abyssinia, however, and Madrid was not Malaga.  The new People's Republican Army was no longer the rag-tag mix of militia units that had fought the Nationalists only a few months before.  The Italians were repulsed after a fierce campaign fought under very tough conditions.  Madrid was once again saved for the Republicans, and two more years of war would ensue.&#10;&#10;Special rules regarding tanks, anti-tank defenses, flamethrowers, truck transports, traffic jams, morale, and panic will allow you to recreate the Italian offensive.

        "description": "The good, honest seafarers sail from one treasure island to the next.  However, Salvador Sea Devil, the Black pirate stays hard on their heels trying to pillage their treasures.  Using his vessel, the &quot;Black Svenja&quot;, Salvador Sea Devil quickly approaches and tries to board the seafarers' boats. The seafarers immediately set sail. Suddenly a strong gust of wind whistles around their heads and as the sails tighten the boat skims across the sea. At the very last moment they escape from Salvador, the Sea Devil.&#10;&#10;The game board shows the sea and various islands. The six islands with harbor are the treasure islands. On each treasure island there is a colored flag. Put a gold coin on each treasure island.&#10;One island shows the flag of the pirate: this is the pirate&lsquo;s island. Put the pirate vessel into the bay of the pirate island.&#10;Each player takes a little bag and a boat of the same color. Place your boat on the ship of the corresponding color shown in the center of the game board.&#10;The remaining gold coins, the bellows and both dice are kept ready next to the game board.&#10;&#10;At sea, there is nearly always a strong wind blowing. Sailing boats use the force of the wind: the big sails gather the wind, which then propels the ships forward. You can provoke strong gusts of wind with the bellows, to move the ships on.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Metromania is a game of placement and connection which allows 2 to 4 players to build a subway network between different cities.&#10;&#10;Each player builds 2 different subway lines, trying to go through the city and connect important places of housing, work, and leisures. After a construction phase, trip-tests verify the best and quickest lines.&#10;&#10;The mechanism is easy: during his turn, a player puts 3 line counters on the board. If his line meets another line, a station is built where the two connect. The subway network is developed through this process. Because the grid on the board and the line counters are triangular, players have some real placement questions.&#10;&#10;The game is very interactive, with players sometimes trying to cooperate and sometimes trying to stop other lines. They also choose, during the construction phase, the start and the end of the final trip-tests. But it's never the same player who places both start and end, so a player must anticipate and guess carefully.&#10;&#10;",
