Players, in the role of merchants, see this as an opportunity to make quick profits by selling goods in the bustling city during the Prince's visit.

Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods? Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!&#10;&#10;In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself. Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack. The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to be seen as an honest merchant? Will you make a deal with the Sheriff to let you in? Or will you persuade the Sheriff to target another player while you quietly slip by the gate? Declare your goods, negotiate deals, and be on the lookout for the Sheriff of Nottingham!&#10;&#10;Sheriff of Nottingham is the first game in the Dice Tower Essentials Line from Arcane Wonders.&#10;&#10;",

The tiles grant you cards, allow you to build a factory or mine, let you hunt strange beasts, or simply earn you some money. Other tiles allow you to attack other players or add to the crisis level on the planet/moon in question.

        "description": "Two games in one package.&#10;&#10;&#10;1914: Glory's End&#10;&#10;Before the award-winning World War I designs Paths of Glory and The Great War In Europe, Deluxe Edition, designer Ted S. Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;In August 1914, Imperial Germany gambled its future on a rapid conquest of France, designed to free up the German army within six weeks to face the Russian steamroller of France&rsquo;s Tsarist ally on the eastern front. Seven German armies deployed opposite five French armies, the army of &ldquo;plucky little Belgium&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Old Contemptibles&rdquo; of the British Expeditionary Force in a series of battles that turned August and September 1914 into the bloodiest months of the entire war.&#10;&#10;1914: Glory&rsquo;s End covers the first three months of the Great War on the western front, from the Guns of August to First Ypres. This oft-gamed campaign receives a unique treatment, emphasizing playability without compromising on historical feel. Units are mostly corps of four steps (two counters per unit), along with a few especially strong (or weak) brigades and divisions, along with counters for the feared German Krupp and Skoda guns. The corps level Order of Battle accurately reflects the operational doctrine of the campaign, while also limiting the number of counters on the map to an easy-to-manage level.&#10;&#10;The game scale is 9.5 miles per hex and three days per turn. The campaign game runs a full 30 turns, but the new edition will include not only a previously published mini-scenario on the Battle of the Marne, but a short ten turn campaign scenario covering the decisive opening weeks of the war. In addition the campaign games can be played in historical or free set-up versions.&#10;&#10;1914: Glory&rsquo;s End uses an Igo-Hugo system with two types of combat to demonstrate the tactical realities of the campaign: Prepared Combat and March Combat. Prepared Combat allows you to bring all your adjacent units to bear against a defending hex, but only with units that don&rsquo;t move. This gives the defender time to reinforce, retreat, or pre-empt your combat with his own attack. To avoid this, you can &ldquo;attack off the march&rdquo; during your movement, but March Combat may only be delivered by a single stack at a time, limiting the force you can bring to bear. Furthermore, March Combat cannot be used against entrenched enemy units.&#10;&#10;The coming of trench warfare is reflected by a unique Entrenchment rule: starting on turn 10 players may entrench one or two hexes per turn, PLUS any hexes adjacent to enemy trenches. The result is that trenches appear first as a tactical consideration, but then turn into a strategic problem as they spread with ever-increasing rapidity along the front.&#10;&#10;1914: Glory&rsquo;s End manages to cover all the important characteristics of the campaign (with rules for forts, cavalry, command and control breakdowns, supply, strategic rail movement, Allied sea movement, German forced marching, Plan XVII, Paris in Danger! and more) while remaining easy to play. The new GMT version will of course incorporate all errata from the original edition, but adds updated artwork, a corrected historical campaign Order of Battle, additional scenarios, and a tweaked set of rules.&#10;&#10;&#10;When Eagles Fight&#10;&#10;Before the award-winning World War I designs Paths of Glory and The Great War In Europe, Deluxe Edition, designer Ted S. Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Winner of the Charles S. Roberts award for best pre-WWII boardgame, When Eagles Fight covers the eastern front in World War I, the last war of Tsarist Russia, Habsburg Austria, and Imperial Germany. From 1914 to 1917 the armies of the Tsar battled from the Carpathians to the Baltic against the outnumbered but logistically superior German army and the badly-led multi-ethnic forces of Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). Though repeatedly inflicting massive defeats on the Habsburg armies, the Russians were ultimately undone by the skill and firepower of the German army and the collapsing political structure of the Tsarist autocracy. By March 1917 the 300 year-old Romanov dynasty was no more, and the stage was set for the coming of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. But the empire of the Habsburgs was left mortally wounded, and the Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany would meet its own doom less than two years later on the battlefields of the western front.&#10;&#10;When Eagles Fight recreates this titanic struggle from the initial clashes at Tannenberg and in Galicia to the revolution that brought down Tsar Nicholas II. The large-hex map covers the eastern front of the Great War from the northern tip of Romania to Petrograd, and from Berlin to Smolensk at a scale of 25 miles to the hex. Turns represent one or two months, and combat units range from division to (mostly) corps.&#10;&#10;When Eagles Fight has a set of low-complexity rules, without sacrificing the historical elements of this unique theater of the Great War. The combat results table is bloody and attritional, but allows for breakthroughs with the right tactics or artillery support. The greater operational skills of the German army is shown in the use of the OberOst HQ, which allows additional attacks on a select part of the front. The Russian supreme headquarters, Stavka, in turn has the ability to concentrate their limited supplies to overcome logistical shortages. And the surprise tactics of the Brusilov Offensive can allow a late game victory over the Austrians.&#10;&#10;Other rules cover the slow pace of Russian mobilization, Austrian Lock-Step Planning in the opening days of the war, German heavy artillery, fortifications, Russian Guards forces, Cavalry Retreats, and the effects of events on other fronts.&#10;&#10;But the new edition of When Eagles Fight is more than just a reprint of the original version. The Random Events Table has been exchanged for a system of random events chits allowing for more events. The effects if the Germans do not launch a Verdun offensive in France-which sometimes threw off the balance of the original design- have been revised. Changes in the stacking rules after 1914 more accurately reflect the effect of trenches on the course of the campaigns. And the map now contains the rail lines removed by Command from the first edition. The game also includes a short alternative-history scenario in which the bulk of the German army goes east rather than west in August 1914.&#10;&#10;These changes make this an improved edition of an already award-winning design. Tense, historical, and just plain fun, When Eagles Fight is a game that belongs in the collection of everyone with an interest in the Great War!&#10;&#10;",

In Villainy you are trying to be the first villain to complete three plans to beat Fantastiman, that pesky super-hero who watches over the city day and night.

You will have to do crimes and go to work as your alter ego to learn the skills necessary and gain the cards required to see your great plans through to their triumphant end.&#10;&#10;Today is the day that Fantastiman will fall...&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics Description:&#10;&#10;In Villainy, players gradually build a stronger team of villains. Each turn, players typically perform a single action which may include purchasing a new team member with money, increasing one of four team member's stats, earning money, and completing objectives.&#10;&#10;Each team member has three primary stats: strength, charisma, and intelligence. In addition, they can each acquire 6 abilities such as a scientific knowledge or the possession of a weapon. Team members can also gain an additional special action and extra income by purchasing an alter ego card such as a software engineer.&#10;&#10;Players draw an initial objective card that describes minimum statistics and abilities a team must have to complete that objective. Players then spend turns building their team to meet those requirements. There is a pool of characters a player can purchase with money. There is another pool of crimes and alter ego cards that a player can select and which will provide money or increase a team member's stats. These pools will cycle throughout the game and choosing which cards to select and which characters to purchase are important to building a strong team.&#10;&#10;Once the requirements are met, they may spend a turn to complete the objective. The first two objectives are met simply by having a team with the right requirements. The third in addition to having these requirements includes a mechanic where the team fights against Fantastiman. During this third and last objective, players will draw random challenge cards that may decrease their team stats and abilities. If the team overcomes these challenges and still meets the minimum requirements, they can then complete the fight by rolling a high value with a dice.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete all three objectives is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are additional challenges or fights which occur both randomly and as a player's action throughout the game.

Six inheritance markers of the appropriate colors are placed upon the colored icons on the saga card. Each player draws a starting hand of four hero cards. Play proceeds clockwise. Each turn consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Catch Your Breath: Draw up to a hand of four cards. &#10;    Embellish Your Story: Optionally use an embellishment for which you meet the qualifications, based on the color of your youngest hero (if one is in play).&#10;    Continue the Tale: Play a card from your hand onto your family tree.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each family tree consists of seven spots and represents the player's heroic lineage. Each hero card possesses a dominant and (in most cases) recessive trait. Traits which match those required by the player's saga may have inheritance markers placed upon them. Once all the player's inheritance markers have been placed on their family tree, they win.&#10;&#10;The player's family tree also allows them to use embellishments matching the color of their youngest hero. If second or third generation heroes of the same color are present, more powerful embellishments may be used.&#10;&#10;",

With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the current situation. Unlike traditional chit-pull mechanisms, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&#10;&#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&#10;    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&#10;&#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards.

Cards in hand can be used to defend your own buckets and attack those of others &mdash; and if you knock out a bucket low in someone's pyramid, you might cause a cascade that takes out even more!&#10;&#10;Each turn, the active player either plays cards or loses buckets; the game is played in rounds with a new round starting after anyone loses one or more buckets. At the start of each round, the active player chooses 1-3 cards in hand of the same color/animal, lays them face up in front of himself, announces their sum, then draws one card to add to his hand (regardless of how many he played). Each subsequent player must lay down 1-3 cards of the same suit as the initial player with a higher sum than previously announced or else lose a bucket. (If play circles the table to the round's start player, he can add 1-3 new cards to those previously played, then announce the sum of all cards in front of him.)&#10;&#10;When a player cannot or chooses not to defend his pyramid by playing cards, he removes one bucket of that card color from his pyramid by pushing, flicking or poking it with only one finger. (If he doesn't have a bucket of the required color, he removes a bucket of his choice.) This player then starts a new round after everyone has cleared their played cards.&#10;&#10;In a two- to four-player game, the game ends when a player loses his last bucket; in a five- to six-player game, a player who loses his last bucket is out of the game, and the game ends when only three players have buckets still in play. Whoever has the most buckets remaining in his pyramid wins.&#10;&#10;Bucket King 3D includes 2 variants for experience players: &#10;(1)Play with the Special &quot;One&quot;!&#10;Whenever a player lays down a 1 while playing cards of the appropriate color, he can also play one other card of any color, adding the value of that card (and any others played) to his sum; he then draws two cards (one as normal, plus another card for the bonus card played) to end his turn. For example, if the required suit is blue, he may play a blue 1, with a red 4 as the additional card, announce his sum as &quot;Five&quot;, then draw two cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;If he plays two 1s, then he may play two additional cards of any color and draw three cards at the end of his turn. A player can lay down at most five cards.&#10;&#10;(2) Play with the Backfiring Discard!&#10;This variant is played with all the basic rules, but the direction of play may change during the game!&#10;When the active player plays cards to attack on his turn, the direction of the play is reversed if he plays an additional card of the same colour onto the discard pile. He draws cards as normal for the cards he has played in front of himself, but he does not draw any card for the additional card he has played.&#10;For example, a player has played a Blue 4. The next player plays a Blue 5 in front of himself and discards a Blue 2. Then he draws only 1 card. The direction changes now and play continues with the previous player.&#10;You may play both variants (1) and (2) in the same game! For example, a player may play a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and the direction of play remains unchanged. But if he plays a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and discards a Blue 2 (variant 2), the game continues in the reverse direction.&#10;&#10;",

Players race to be the first to get to the center of the board while avoiding getting knocked back to the start by other players. Highlighting the power of the prime numbers, Prime Climb is mathematical, deep, creative, and fun.&#10;&#10;Each player controls two pawns that start at the 0 circle. Players take turns rolling two 10-sided dice and applying the values to their two pawns using any of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The first to get both pawns into the 101 circle exactly wins the game! Be careful: if another player lands on you, you get sent back to the start. Along the way, players who land on the red circles collect Prime cards&mdash;some are helpful now, some are helpful later, and a few are trouble!&#10;&#10;One of the great innovations of Prime Climb is the coloring scheme. Each of the prime numbers less than 10 has its own color: 2 is orange, 3 is green, 5 is blue, and 7 is purple. After 10, each prime number is red. Any number that is not a prime is a mix of colors that corresponds to its prime factors. For example, 14 = 2 x 7, so the 14 circle is half orange and half purple.&#10;&#10;The color coding allows players a way to quickly analyze the factors and multiples of the numbers on the board. This helps players check their multiplication and division, and even allows kids who haven't yet learned multiplication to play the game.&#10;&#10;",

So it all comes down to your choices and your strategies! There is also tactical space during a game to zig and zag, even if you find yourself against an Earl Deck design that you did not anticipate.

This year there are 6 new wrestlers debuting, so go out and win some matches!&#10;&#10;Over the 4 seasons whomever has won the most points is the winner.  In a round, players can play cards or pass on their turn.  Players play 1-3 cards on their turn of the same type of Wrestler (that hasn\\'t already been played), to help resolve the strength of the wrestler.  The faster you get rid of your cards, the better your chances of winning.  As soon as you rid your cards you get to take the highest point token available, then the next player to go out gets the next token.  Once there is only 1 player remaining, the round ends and that player gets the -1 token.&#10;&#10;",

Call forth your champions to battle against those of your timeless foes. Harness the legacy of each champion's deeds as they echo across time to empower the next. For the Champions of Aerim, this cycle continues, as it always has and always will. For the Eternals, there is only...strife.&#10;&#10;Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.&#10;&#10;Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.&#10;&#10;Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

That's almost 2.5 million extra games every day.&#10;&#10;Back in 2006, Ted Alspach provided a solution to this problem with a simple card game called Start Player. Just turn over a card, and you'll know who the start player is.&#10;&#10;That was a wonderful solution...for 2006. But we're clearly living in the future now, and there's no time for getting out the box, shuffling cards, and finally turning a card over. It's time for something better, faster, and a whole lot more technologically advanced. It's time for Start Player Express.&#10;&#10;Start Player Express consists of four custom dice. There's no shuffling, there's a whole lot less reading, and there's no messing with a box. (You're not a Neanderthal, are you?) Just roll the dice and BOOM! You know who goes first.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Conan",
        "description": "Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.&#10;&#10;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.&#10;&#10;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).&#10;&#10;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.&#10;&#10;Components (according to the back of the box):&#10;&#10;     16 spell cards (in either English or French)&#10;     39 equipment cards (in either English or French)&#10;     60 tiles (actually 75, see below)&#10;     161 tokens&#10;     8 Hero sheets (one side in English, the other in French)&#10;     4 player aid sheets (one side in English, the other in French)&#10;     1 turn counter sheet (both sides in English)&#10;     1 Hero rule book (in either English or French)&#10;     1 Overlord rulebook (13 scenarios) (in either English or French)&#10;     2 map boards&#10;     15 dice&#10;     75 &quot;gems&quot; (blue and red)&#10;     25 coloured bases (5 each in red, orange, green, blue, purple)&#10;     106 miniatures (plastic)&#10;     1 Overlord board (plastic)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The tiles need to be looked at more closely. 13 come in English-French pairs, another 35 are in the edition's language (either French or English), and the remaining 14 tiles come in non-lingual pairs (two each of Khosatral Khel, Skuthus, Thak, Zaporavo, and Zogar Sag, plus four Thog). A functional set of tiles is thus 62 strong, the remaining 27 tiles being set aside. This is probably an artefact of the printing, with one sheet of tiles being bilingual and the remaining two uni-lingual.&#10;&#10;",
