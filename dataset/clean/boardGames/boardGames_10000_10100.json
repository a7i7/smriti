Each game board shows nine dice, and once arranged the completed grid shows 36 dice, with the dice being numbered 1-6 and showing six colors, with each combination of number and color appearing exactly once. Roll the color die and number die to determine the starting location for the transparent robot, then mark this space with the transparent starting token.&#10;&#10;In a round, roll the two dice to determine the target space; you can mark this space with a transparent victory token or simply have everyone remember which space they're trying to reach. Everyone simultaneously tries to figure out how to move the robot to the target space, and to move the robot, it must move orthogonally to a space that shares either the color or number of its current location. If the robot starts on &quot;3-green&quot;, for example, it can move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 3 or is green; if you'd move it to &quot;5-green&quot;, it can now once again move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 5 or is green; and so on.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has a solution, they yell out the number of moves, then take the robot and demonstrate the solution. If the solution takes exactly the number of moves claimed, the player earns a victory token; if not, the player gives one of their victory tokens (if they have any) to the player with the fewest tokens. In either case, the former target space becomes the new starting space for the next round.&#10;&#10;If any player possesses five victory tokens, they win! If the 25 victory tokens are distributed before someone collects five, then whoever holds the most tokens wins, with ties being possible.&#10;&#10;Expert Micro Robots players can increase the challenge of the game by placing the target victory token on the board, then rolling the two dice once again. The players must now determine a solution that first moves the robot to the space showing on the dice, then to the final destination.&#10;&#10;The transparent robot in Micro Robots can also be used in Ricochet Robots. This robot moves like any other robot in that game except that for an additional move it can pass through a wall instead of stopping at it. It cannot move through the central barrier or the exterior walls, and the only target space on which it can land is the colored vortex.&#10;&#10;",

The total number of animals in the collective is based on the number of players, but one animal in the collective will always be face-down.

As players choose their group of animals, they drop out of the turn. The first player to drop out of a turn starts the next turn. The game ends when an ark has at least ten animals on board.&#10;&#10;Before scoring, all animals in pairs are discarded because a guy called Noah claims all animal pairs for himself. Single animals score the points imprinted on the tile (from 1-5) and herds of animals automatically score five points each. Remaining food crates also score one point each.&#10;&#10;",

But when an ominous force invades the world, Bethel Woods becomes a distant memory, lost inside the thickets of the forest.&#10;&#10;Now a group of young people, wearing the crest of the orphanage, return to finish the work that was started long ago. They must work diligently, however, to repair and restore the machines scattered throughout the forest, before the ominous force finds the technology and destroys the only chance the world has in surviving.&#10;&#10;The cooperative game Bethel Woods is set in the universe of &quot;Hours&quot;, created by author, Jessy Ribordy (Falling Up/The River Empires) and uses a mancala-like mechanism. Players first pick up all the Workers from any one of the 6 Machines surrounding the Orphanage, then move either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the board, dropping one worker on each Machine and fixing Malfunctions as they go. There are 4 Malfunction types, each with a matching Worker type to fix it. All Malfunctions that players fix are added to their personal supply as &quot;Knowledge&quot;.&#10;&#10;To win, players need to send 6 of the 12 Workers into Bethel Woods Orphanage with increasing amounts of Knowledge to construct the &quot;Daydreamer&quot; (a machine that will rescue the orphanage's inhabitants from the impending downfall). The first Worker needs just 1 Knowledge of their type, the second 2, the third 3, and so on.&#10;&#10;Players also need to use their acquired Knowledge to uncover spies, hidden within each of the Machines. Players may uncover 1 Spy only on the last Machine they place a Worker on each turn.&#10;&#10;After each turn, three random Malfunctions are drawn and added to the various Machines. If a Machine has more than 3 Malfunctions and/or Spies, it goes into the critical state. These all make the task of maintaining the Machines and constructing the Daydreamer that much harder. Also, any round where at least one Machine goes critical, results in a Spy being placed.&#10;&#10;Players lose the game if at the end of a player's turn, there are 4 critical Machines. They can also lose immediately if there are ever 6 Spies on the board or not enough Malfunctions when placing them.&#10;&#10;",

Emboldened by these signs, students and intellectuals in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, organize a protest of previously unseen magnitudes. As the communist leadership sweeps in to kill the movement in its tracks a violent response is provoked, thus sparking the Revolution of the 23rd of October.&#10;&#10;One player takes charge of the Soviet forces trying to shape the headlines to his liking and uses the militia and snipers of the State Protection Authority to stop the revolutionaries at all cost. The other player(s) (from 1-3 opponents) co-operatively play as the ringleaders of the revolutionary forces collecting resources (represented as icons on their cards) and recruiting other fighters to ensure the revolution's events end up in favor of their side, while fighting off tanks and soldiers in this exciting, historically inspired card driven game.&#10;&#10;Days of Ire: Budapest 1956 is played over seven days &mdash; the last week of October 1956. The Soviet commander plays headline cards at the beginning of every turn, gathering Command Points and triggering effects that sometimes help, sometimes hinder the revolutionary effort. This card-play, reminiscent of well-known card-driven wargames (CDG) such as Twilight Struggle or Labyrinth: War on Terror, is what drives the tempo and the strategic thrust of the game. The other player(s) form the revolutionary side. They collect cards and fighters for two reasons: to resolve events for boosts to their side, and to fight off militia, snipers, and Soviet tanks in a drastic fight for survival. They have to manage their positions while spreading across Budapest, carefully dividing their actions as a team and always keeping an eye on their morale lest they run out of cards. This team-playing aspect &mdash; reminiscent of highly successful cooperative games such as Pandemic &mdash; guarantees ease of access to players who would otherwise be more intimidated by a traditional CDG.&#10;&#10;If any of the revolutionary ringleaders suffer too many wounds, or if they fail to resolve enough events by the end of the game, history changes and the revolution falls. But if they keep the streets of Budapest free from oppression, the revolution lives on, to fight another day.&#10;&#10;Historical Note: In real life, the revolution succeeded, and Hungary was free for less than a week. On the 4th of November, the Soviet forces quickly recaptured the country, but that is a subject for a different game...&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player plays as many cards as desired by paying the cost of each card &mdash; that is, discarding cards of the proper colors that match the cost of the card being played &mdash; then placing the card in an empty slot on their side of the game board. Many cards have powers that take effect when played.&#10;&#10;After playing cards on a turn, each card does damage equal to its strength to any opponent's card on the other side of the game board. If no opponent's card is present, then with military power the player does damage directly to the opponent, swinging a pendulum of strength in their favor. If you reach a total of 7 on the pendulum, you win. Your troops can also grant you an additional card at the end of the turn (three instead of two) or tokens that make it cheaper to play cards.&#10;&#10;Instead of winning via military, you can instead win by having all six slots on your side of the board filled with cards at the start of your turn.&#10;&#10;",

Seven separate player abilities re-combine each round, depending on the favor of the gods earned that round by each player. For example, earning the favor of the god Ra lets you add a Player Disc to the current Sun for area control around the edges of the board. Ptah allows you to claim the current Monument Card for set collection scoring. Seshat lets you place the current Monument Standee on the board to add to the network of Monuments in play.

The Pharaoh lets you secretly contribute cards to the construction of the Pyramid, awarding the greater contributor many points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Over a series of eight rounds, players work to build a Pyramid and a series of smaller monuments to impress the Pharaoh. By performing actions unique to each god, players build monuments and align them to point at other monuments, gaining influence over the Pharaoh as they do so.

The only thing the dictators have to do to avoid eminent repercussions is disarm some nuclear facilities in order to remove the nuclear threat targeting their home countries. Sounds simple, right?

The board shows a map of North America and is divided into four &quot;Nuclear Zones&quot;; each zone consists of several states, of which some include a nuclear facility. Every player receives a unique nuclear facility card for each nuclear zone.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into turns, and each turn consists of any possible combination of the following three actions: draw a Command card, play a Command card and Travel (maximum of once per turn).

Each turn you can do 3 actions (place a realm tile or place one dwarf in a tile or move one dwarf by one tile).&#10;&#10;Each tile has a pre-requisite of how many dwarfs of one player are needed to perform one kind of action. For example: emerald mines have always three slots, but you will need only two dwarfs to take one emerald. When this task is done (collect one emerald) your two dwarfs will return to your pool.&#10;&#10;When a player completes three goals (both open and secret goals are taken into account), the endgame begins. Players who had not played this round make their last turn and, then, the game ends. The points are calculated and wins the match who has more points.&#10;&#10;",

Next, players elect a Guillotine Operator, who decides whether or not the pawn on the guillotine is executed or spared. Once settled, a Secretary is elected to divvy out cake and generals to the players, one card per player. But before these cards are taken, the players elect a Food Inspector who may, at the cost of a medal, declare all cake unsafe.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players will accumulate medals, generals, and cake. Fewest medals make you the Enemy of the Revolution, but the player with the most Generals is immune to such accusations!

The game ends when one player reaches 40 or more cakes, a player has their last pawn executed, or the deck runs out. The player with the most cake wins!&#10;&#10;",

Collecting as many as you can of one kind is valuable, but having one of each kind can be beneficial, too. Just avoid being bitten too badly by the mosquitos!&#10;&#10;In Costa Rica, all player take part in an expedition, with the active player of a turn deciding where to go and exploring a new tile. In clockwise order, each player must decide whether to leave this expedition and collect all of the animals seen so far, or whether to remain with the group to (hopefully) collect more animals later? Once a player does leave the current expedition, they remove their pawn from that group, collecting nothing else from it.&#10;&#10;",

Until the very end nobody knows which snail belongs to which opponent, which guarantees great excitement. The game has simple rules, and victory is decided by tactics and the ability to bluff.&#10;&#10;In P&#196;&#153;dz&#196;&#133;ce &#197;&#154;limaki: Na jednej nodze (&quot;Running Snails: On one leg&quot;) every player controls two out of five snails. It may happen that some snails are controlled by two players. On a turn a player rolls the dice, chooses one of them and moves a snail with a color corresponding to the chosen die. After that she passes to the next player all dice but the chosen one. When the number of dice passed is reduced to one then the current receives all of the dice.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the snails finishes the race. At this point snails are awarded points: 5 for 1st place, 2 for 2nd place and 3 for last place. Snails can also earn points during the race by landing on a mushrrom or pushing back other snails. The player who has the most point at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;P&#196;&#153;dz&#196;&#133;ce &#197;&#154;limaki is a 3rd game in Egmont Polska series (all designed by Reiner Knizia) containing following games:&#10;P&#196;&#153;dz&#196;&#133;ce &#197;&#187;&oacute;&#197;&#130;wie (Ribbit)&#10;P&#196;&#153;dz&#196;&#133;ce Je&#197;&#188;e (Bucket Brigade)&#10;P&#196;&#153;dz&#196;&#133;ce &#197;&#154;limaki&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Kharnage is a fast and fun fighting game in a med-fan world in which you are the warchief of the mighty humans, the strong (and alcoholic) dwarves, the amazing horde of goblins, or the ferocious orcs (and their giant!). Your goal in Kharnage is to take control of something strategically essential, astoundingly beautiful, and envy of all other nations: a hill. Yes, just a hill. Admittedly, it is a nice hill. It may have a very commanding view of the surroundings, or it may not. You won't know until you get up there! To do so, you're going to have to drive off the armies of the other players by simply causing as much mayhem and bloodshed as possible.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you choose one battle card. The player with the lowest initiative value begins and:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Deploys new units and applies skills if needed, or&#10;     Attacks (shoot or assault) one opponent with all points, or two opponents by dividing their points.&#10;&#10;&#10;The next player then begins their turn, doing the same. After all players have taken their turn, the player who destroyed the largest number of units wins 5 domination points, the second 3 domination points, and the third 1 domination point. The last one has only their eyes for crying.&#10;&#10;Each time a player totally destroys an opponent army, they must yell &quot;KHARNAGE!&quot;, loud and clear, and stomp the table. They then take a Kharnage token worth 1 domination point. The other players must cheer them on by yelling &quot;YEAH!&quot;; if not, they lose a Kharnage token if they have one.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the warchief with the most domination points wins!&#10;&#10;",
