You have $1,000,000 cash, $2,000,000 in debt and 2000 oz. of gold to begin. There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comess when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.  A good finance game, but it was only printed for a year in America.  Copies do pop up on eBay (where I got mine).&#10;&#10;",

Each person then distributes a number of points to Start Speed, Top Speed, Wear and other attributes, five points per lap.  Then, each player moves based on their speed, and can adjust their speed, choosing to forfeit a Wear Point, or roll the Chance Die, where a bad roll could cause you to move through, spin out, or even crash out of the race.  Whoever gets over the line first wins.&#10;&#10;Before the race begins the players prepare their cars by allocating points, so if you want faster acceleration or speed you have to sacrifice start speed or braking or tire wear.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players write their planned speed for the next turn and then move their cars 1 space per 20 mph. Each curve on the track has a speed limit that cannot be exceeded without penalty. If you exceed curve speed, overaccelerate or overdecelerate your car, etc., you pay penalties in tire wear or possible damage to your car or elimination from the race.&#10;&#10;The original 3M Sports Games version used speedometer wheels to select speed, used a random card draw to determine the car characteristics and has no random elements.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Speed Circuit: British Grand Prix&#10;    Speed Circuit: Detroit Grand Prix&#10;    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de Belgique&#10;    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de France&#10;    Speed Circuit: South African Grand Prix&#10;    Speed Circuit Accessory Pack 1&#10;    Speed Circuit Accessory Pack 2&#10;    Speed Circuit Accessory Pack 3&#10;    Speed Circuit Accessory Pack 4&#10;    Speed Circuit Tournament Tracks&#10;    Speed Circuit Turnier Kurs&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so. After someone has claimed a set, the cardholder lays out three more cards. (If all players agree that no sets can be claimed, then the cardholder lays out three more cards. These cards aren't replaced after someone claims a set.) Whoever claims the most sets wins!&#10;&#10;",

The top company of each stack is vulnerable to proxy take-overs by other players, so they usually attempt to order their holdings such that the most valuable ones are covered by less valuable companies.  Scoring occurs whenever a player draws a profit card from the deck.

Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.&#10;&#10;Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.&#10;&#10;There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable. During this period the judgment of takeover prices becomes even more tricky (and a gamble).&#10;&#10;",

Each card is unique because in addition to the cop, they each have a diffrent symbol on them, i.e. a Tree, a Stop Sign, etc. Now put them in a circle with their feet toward the inside of the circle. Further, you also have a deck of 21 Direction cards and each has a symbol (which corresponds to the ones on the Traffic Cop cards) and 3 directions on them, i.e. A Tree, 4 Rights, 3 Lefts, 2 Lefts. This Direction deck is placed face down in the center of the circle. Anyone flips a direction card and it all starts; start at the Traffic Cop that has the matching symbol, then move left and right as the card calls for, but remember you must move to the Traffic Cop's left or right. So depending on if they are facing forward or backwards, you go the appropriate direction. Whoever calls out the correct stopping place first, by symbol, wins the card.

At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &quot;potion&quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.&#10;&#10;The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you're trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card 'transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.&#10;&#10;Add in one more gavel card type ('work in lab') which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing.

It has the feel of a &quot;capture the flag&quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply &quot;playing with the rules&quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).&#10;&#10;Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.&#10;&#10;Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called &quot;The Big Sell Out&quot;).&#10;&#10;Richard Garfield himself considered Netrunner as his best boardgame design instead of CCG design game, and he loves games that include bluffing mechanics; with Netrunner, bluffing is an integral part of the game.&#10;&#10;When it was released in 1996, many gaming magazines gave Netrunner critical acclaim as the best CCG ever designed.

Once all combinations have been claimed, each player gets one more turn in which they're allowed to keep playing as long as they keep stealing ownership of a card.

But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.&#10;&#10;Players bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6). When as many rows as there are players in the game are filled, it's Pay Day. A die is rolled and the outermost card beside the corresponding die symbol is turned up. The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track. The game ends either when one player has 3 vulture chips; a player reaches or passes the winning space on the prestige track; or the undertaker reaches his final space. When the game ends the player farthest along the prestige track wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "'Eden is the dream of making arid land fertile. At the outset, the board is a desert. Players play irrigation cards that allow them to place plant tiles in the desert, thus bringing life and fertility to it. As the desert grows, cultivation cards may develop the plant tiles further, making them more valuable and bringing players much manna. The player who first gets tiles valued at 20 &quot;fertility points&quot; on the board wins. But watch out! As the desert blooms competition for the land increases, and other players will try to take your most fertile land away.&#10;&#10;The game play in Eden is simple. Either play one or two irrigation cards to develop areas of desert (i.e. place tiles on the board), or play a cultivation card to increase the value of areas already on the board (i.e. replace existing tiles with more valuable ones, at a cost), or pass. Conflict enters the game when a player places a new tile on the board next to an opponent's existing tile. Then a challenge may be made by the player placing the tile. Manna, the currency in the game, is used in the challenge, which takes the form of a bidding war. Bids, which must be divisible by 5, are always increased. But what the winning bidder actually must pay is the bid MULTIPLIED by the value of the tiles that would be gained. In the case of the challenger, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles sought. In the case of the defender, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles the defender is using in what in effect is an attack. Bids keep rising until one player is unwilling, or unable, to meet the final cost of a bid. The loser forfeits all the tiles involved in the conflict, but gains the value of that land (according to the bid) in manna from the other player.&#10;&#10;",

Players explore a dungeon that is divided into levels of increasing difficulty, fighting monsters for valuable treasure. As players venture deeper into the dungeon, the monsters become more difficult and the treasure more valuable. Several character classes each have slightly different fighting abilities &ndash; most notably the wizard, who can cast spells. Combat is simulated using dice; players roll the dice to attack a monster, and if unsuccessful, the dice are rolled to determine the effect of the monster's counter-attack.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to bring a certain amount of treasure back to the Dungeon's entrance.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Classic Dungeon&#10;    The New Dungeon&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The players are adventurers seeking gold in an abandoned mine. Each ventures into the mine equipped with a lantern (with a limited amount of oil). The outer ring of hexes can be searched for additional equipment (torches, oil to refuel the lamp, mushrooms...) whilst the inner hexes are where the gold is to be found. First player to bring back six gold nuggets wins. Or,if all adventurers are killed, the player whose spider has scored the most kills wins...&#10;Finding gold isn't as easy as it seems; the richest hexes (smack in the mine's center, of course) only yield gold on a 4+ (on a d6); using the lantern gives a +1.&#10;Where it gets really fun is with the mine's other denizens: each player controls, in addition to his adventurer, a spider that hops from rock column to rock column (the pivot points where hexes meet; the board is 3D so this works really well) spinning webs --little cardboard barriers that slide into place between rock pillars. Adventurers &quot;attack&quot; the webs when they try to step through and could stay tangled (the adventurer pieces are slotted so they can be put on top of the web they're stuck in). Whilst thus caught, spiders can try to bite them --four bites and you're eliminated! The lantern is very useful in such a case as its light scares the spiders away.&#10;The spiders can co-operate to build stronger webs, and it isn't unusual for one spider to strengthen the web an adventurer is caught in so another spider has a better chance of biting him.&#10;All in all, a very enjoyable game. Works best with the full set of six players.&#10;&#10;",
