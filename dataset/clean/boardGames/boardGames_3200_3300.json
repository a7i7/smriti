        "description": "In October of 1965, General Vo Nguyen Giap launched a full North Vietnamese Army division in a sweeping offensive against the thinly guarded II Corps area west of Pleiku in South Vietnam's Central Highlands. Two special forces camps, a handful of elite soldiers, and thirty miles of rugged, jungled terrain were all that stood between the onrushing NVA and their objective, the strategic town of Pleiku. The NVA quickly surrounded and besieged the camps, threatening a quick and easy victory over the outnumbered II Corps defenders. Desperate to hold back the tide of Communist soldiers, the South Vietnamese commander asked the U.S. for help.&#10;&#10;The newly formed 1st Cavalry Division, fresh in country and bivouacked at nearby An Khe, rushed to the aid of the beleaguered garrisons. With its complement of over 400 combat helicopters, the 1st Cav was completely airmobile. While the helicopter's mobility guaranteed quick movement and ready resupply, it did not guarantee victory. The soldiers that the unblooded Americans faced were tough, well trained veterans. Victory would not come easily for the Americans.&#10;&#10;Between October 23 and November 25, 1965, a desperate struggle between a full North Vietnamese Army Division and the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division took place west of Pleiku in Vietnam's Central Highlands. Silver Bayonet is a company-level game which focuses on this conflict.&#10;--from box back description&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     200 die-cut Counters&#10;     1 22&quot;x34&quot; Mapsheet&#10;     1 Rule/Scenario Booklet&#10;     3 Player Aid Cards&#10;     1 10-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 1 day per game turn&#10;Map Scale: 1 mile per hex&#10;Unit Scale: Company&#10;Players: Two&#10;Playing Time:&#10;5-30 minutes for introductory scenario&#10;1-2 hours for advanced scenario&#10;2-20 hours for campaign game&#10;&#10;Other features include air support, SAMs, transport helicopters, hidden units, limited intelligence, 12 scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Patrol: Man-to-Man Combat in the 20th Century, is an individual man level simulation of non-urban infantry combat from World War 1 to the present.  The game features various scenarios in which the average infantry squad would become involved.  Typical scenarios simulate meeting engagements, ambushes, raids, snatch missions and assualts on fortified positions.&#10;&#10;Sequel to the game Sniper! (first edition) Popular tactical combat system.&#10;&#10;As in Sniper, each player controls the equivalent of a squad of 5 to 15 men depending on the period, the scenario, and whether you attack or defend. One scenario corresponds to a few (one to five) minutes of real time action. The scale is a little larger than in Sniper (5 meters/hex, 5 seconds/turn vs 3 and 3 in Sniper), and there is no facing. The game system (though rated 7.1, ie pretty high, on SPI complexity scale), is quite straightforward and easy to learn. In the beginning of each turn, players secretly &quot;buy&quot; actions for all of their men. A normal man has 10 Movement Points to expend per turn. Fire, direct or opportunity, consumes all MP, as reloading one's weapon, or rearming (ie readying to use it after throwing a grenade or shooting a rifle grenade). Standing up, preparing a grenade, throwing it, cost 5MP. And movement costs MP depending on terrain...&#10;After all actions have been plotted, players check for panic: a certain percentage of all your men, depending on their hex number, have their actions canceled, or move randomly. (although very annoying, this rule does wonders at simulating low level control problems). Then, all remaining actions are performed: combat, movement, and finally grenade and artillery impacts. Rules cover a large variety of equipment: weapons like rifles, MP, MG, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and flamethrowers, but also barbed wire, pillboxes, artillery, mines, and up to one vehicle (APC or tank) per side. Five kind of combat situations are covered: patrol, reconnaissance, ambush, raid and assault. Some lending themselves quite well to solitaire play. A large number of scenarios (from WWI to modern) are provided, and you can easily design your own. A standard scenario plays in a couple of hours. Altogether, I think the system is pretty good for such a man to man combat situation. However, be warned that this very detailed scale has a peculiar feeling, which not all &quot;tactical&quot; game players (ie players used to ASL or Gamers TCS, which focus on company/battalion level units) will like:&#10;in Patrol! the player is a sergeant, not a captain.&#10;review by: Francois Charton&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 5 seconds to 5 minutes&#10;Hex: 5.4 yards / 5 meters&#10;Units: Individual Soldiers &amp; Vehicles&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Six 9 x 9&quot; four color maps&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Patrol rulebook&#10;Foure Player Aids Cards&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-6 hours&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Princes of the Renaissance is set in Renaissance Italy. Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.&#10;&#10;No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.&#10;&#10;",

The auctioneer can accept the highest bid, take the money, and sell the next card, or the auctioneer can take the card by himself, but then he is no longer the auctioneer (next clockwise is). If no one bids on something, the auctioneer must take the card (that can be hard because money is really short) - so you have to be careful what you sell.&#10;&#10;The cards you're bidding on are production places, technologies, resources, and improvements (bonus). After the bidding phase you can build production places and improvements and develop technologies, then you immediately get victory points. For that you need money and resources (mainly from other production places).&#10;&#10;Problem: If you build late (next period started) you get less or nothing.&#10;&#10;At the end you get extra points for good improvement combinations and production places that work together.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: &#10;&#10;    Industry&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile's yield will be. Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round. The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money. The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like. Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground. At game's end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type &ndash; the bigger the better. But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players.&#10;&#10;",

In what became known as the Winter War, ferocious Finnish resistance soon shocked the world and inflicted repeated defeats on the invaders.&#10;&#10;The Soviet plan included attacks in the dark forests of Eastern Karelia, attempting to outflank the stout line of Finnish fortifications to the south. Their 139th Rifle Division advanced in early December 1939 along the river Aittijoki, faced by only a handful of Finnish battalions. The Finns panicked in some places, and a near-rout seemed inevitable. Finnish Marshal Carl Gustav Mannerheim sent a small group of reinforcements led by Col. Paavo Talvela, previously in charge of buying artillery ammunition for the army.&#10;&#10;Talvela proved that a warrior lived within the bureaucrat, as he put new heart into his men and stemming the Soviet advance. After heavy fighting, the Finns had destroyed the 139th Rifle Division and routed the 75th Rifle Division. But they suffered serious losses as well, as the Soviets here had committed ski troops of their own including the &ldquo;Red Finns&rdquo; seldom mentioned by Finnish writers.&#10;&#10;Winter Fury re-creates the twin battles of Tolvaj&auml;rvi and Ilomantsi from 1939, as well as the 1941 Finnish offensive over the same ground. It uses a &ldquo;variable impulse&rdquo; game system to model the two armies&rsquo; very different capabilities. Each turn, each player puts a number of markers into a common container. These are then drawn one by one, the number drawn varying with the current weather condition. The Finnish player has weaker forces, but will usually draw more markers and these allow the Finns to conduct more operations. The good Finnish units are better than the Soviet ones, and more mobile in the forests. The Soviet cannot move his or her divisions together, complicating the Red Army&rsquo;s efforts. But Soviet artillery is very powerful while Finnish guns are little more than a nuisance. The Soviet player also has tanks and armored cars, which not only are powerful in battle (at least on the roads), they also might cause the Finns to panic and run away.&#10;&#10;Winter Fury is the second in our line of Playbooks: a 64-page book about the battle and the forces involved that also includes a complete historical game on the subject. The book includes a lengthy background piece by David Lippman as well as rules, scenarios and other historical data. There are 280 playing pieces and a 34x22-inch map.&#10;&#10;",

On the o&shy;ne hand it depends surely o&shy;n the fact that the Second World War is a very serious topic which of course does not simplify its realization in a card game, o&shy;n the other hand this very background requires the great historical precision and complexity that seemed difficult to achieve until now.&#10;&#10;The alphaBIT company from Hannover (Germany) takes charge of this problematic topic from now o&shy;n and excels by a balance of realism and subtle intuition. History of War (HoW) presents the Second World War solely as the tactical fight of units.  Retaliatory weapons, atom bombs or personal names like those of generals are deliberately excluded from the game.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is a conquest of land cards that should bring together 15 win points. A means to an end in this case are the mentioned units and the HoW really succeeded to bring together three large parts of a war: fight by land, by air and by sea.&#10;&#10;It makes the game truly particular as even computer games have difficulties in combining these three types of units. As a rule they are divided into land/air or sea/air. In History of War o&shy;n the contrary  the players can use all the units like infantry, tanks, artillery, fighters, bombers, submarines and cruisers in o&shy;ne and the same deck without problems. In addition just like in all other TCGs they can choose freely in a great card pool and make up their own deck.&#10;&#10;There appears another positive aspect  that would please first of all the players with not much means: there is no degree of rarity in HoW. All the cards of an edition are available exactly o&shy;nce in a set which means that a player knows what he buys and already with a few sets is equipped enough for a chosen side. The mentioning of the units provokes the question how they could be paid. The usual  principle in other TCGs  works here as well: some special cards provide the resources. These are called base improvements in HoW. These cards deliver not o&shy;nly the important  technical values (TVs) necessary for payment of units, action cards and effects, but they possess as well useful qualities, so that the mere choice of his base improvements has decisive  consequences for a player. The TVs deliver also the country improvements that can be placed directly in the countries and thus are imminently exposed to the attacks of the enemy, but then dispose of the interesting effects. The units paid with the TVs are played in the so-called deployment zone. The units have different attack and defense values for various areas like land, air and sea. The victory flags o&shy;n the unit cards necessary to conquer the countries are transformed into the win points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;More detailed and profound division of the values, ammunition consumption, moral and so o&shy;n known from other games were deliberately resigned to make a game easy-to handle. Such special characteristics of the units were replaced by useful abilities that make the game fluent and the rules clear. The final transformation of the units into win points is based o&shy;n historical accuracy.&#10;&#10;All the cards show the high quality pictures or even photos of the Second World War and the unit cards are enriched by engineering data. HoW is surely a must for lovers of strategy games, interesting and affordable o&shy;n top of that thanks to the absence of  degree of rarity.&quot;&#10;&#10;You can find lot of pictures and a rule discussion forum on their German webpage: www.history-of-war.com [you can change the webpage language clicking on the UK banner on the left, once in]&#10;&#10;",

Two to four players send ships to explore islands scattered about a 5 x 12 square ocean (the more players, the  more islands). The settlement of the new lands is, however, strictly abstract.&#10;&#10;Each player's turn begins with the roll of one 6-sided die. A &quot;6&quot; is a random event (pirates, fire or good fortune - bad twice as often as lucky, and most likely to damage players who are doing well). On other results, each player gains a commodity from one of his five workshops. The player who rolled may then buy commodities from the bank, sell them to his colonists for gold (no trading among players), or use them in various combinations to recruit new colonists, promote existing ones, or build ships. After that, ships can sail for the unknown lands.&#10;&#10;Each island bears on its hidden side an outpost, a treasure or a trade agreement. After being discovered, these items are brought back to the home country (and the ship is removed from play, requiring the player to build a new one in order to keep searching). Outposts increase the productivity of workshops. Treasure yields either gold or free colonist promotions. Trade agreements reduce the gold needed to buy commodities from the bank.&#10;&#10;Besides being useful in these ways, outposts, gold and agreements are among the game's victory conditions. A player wins by being to first to attain three out of five objectives, namely, four outposts, 30 gold, three trade agreements, three colonists promoted to the top rank of &quot;merchant&quot; and the construction of four public buildings. The buildings (8 types, each bringing some advantage) cost nothing but don't become available until a player has recruited at least four colonists. After that, each new colonist adds a building (unless they've been preempted by other players; there aren't enough for everyone).&#10;&#10;Overall, the game falls squarely into the &quot;simultaneous solitaire&quot; category. Except in the race for islands, the players scarcely interact at all. They do, however, have a great many choices to make in the course of play.&#10;&#10;",

The battlefield the game is played on is a hexagon-style 1:4,000,000 scale map of Eastern Europe with each hex represents 72 kilometres (45 miles) from side to side.  Each turn represents approximately 10 days, with 3 turns per month. Units are generally corps of the Axis and armies for the Soviet Union, both about 60,000 troops each, while also consisting of smaller battle groups of specialist formations.&#10;&#10;Trial of Strength heart comes from it's novel and sophisticated integrated movement and combat system called CLIMACS, units conduct combat during the movement phase by expending movement points.  The game is played at Corps / Army scale. There isn't a combat phase in Trial of Strength.  All combat is done somewhat like overruns in the operations phase. A unit in range of a HQ  can roll for initiative to react when a combat is declared. Each HQ gets to do this once during the opponent's turn.&#10;&#10;The air and naval aspect of the game is easy.  There are Armor effects in combat and rules to allow more than one stack at a time to combine their movement. When Armor effects are used the Tanks must take the first loss if any (you will see the way those Panzers get worn down in Barbarossa). Losses are by step with possible retreats and even morale rolls to hold your ground and take more losses instead of retreating.  There is also limited intelligence with many units off the map (Army / Front markers). You can only see the top unit in a stack.&#10;&#10;Trial of Strength employs a special rule-set for the use of airborne, marine, mountain, artillery, rail-gun, rail construction NKVD and SS units.  The presence of an integrated political system into the game-play caters for historical events such as the reticence of Finland and the uprising of the Slovaks among others.

Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &quot;board&quot; in front of each player.

You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).&#10;&#10;If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.&#10;&#10;The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game.

There are four types of card:&#10;&#10;    Magic Spell: This spell is auctioned off between the mages who were sent to this card. It is paid for in Energy, and it can be used to get more energy or victory points.&#10;    Orb: Each mage who was sent here gets a certain amount of Energy.&#10;    Holy Site: Each mage who was sent here gets a certain amount of victory points and a random Artifact card.&#10;    Monster: The monster card is auctioned off the mages who were sent to this card. The player that wins it, defeats the monster and gets an amount of Magical Energy and/or victory points. The players may also decide to skip the auction and cooperate to defeat the monster, which will yield less reward.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;After the Adventures have been resolved, players may trade and play Artifacts (some Artifacts are only useful in pairs). Played Artifacts will give Magical Energy and/or victory points.&#10;&#10;The game continues until the deck of Adventure Cards is depleted; the player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

To make progress in the game you must form a coalition with at least one other player, but to actually win requires betraying your coalition.  It is said that 'The four authors still occasionally talk to each other' and the initial tests of the game resulted in married couples going home from parties in separate cabs.&#10;&#10;The objective is to be the last player with a stockpile of chips.  (Each player starts with seven of a unique color.) Each play reduces your stockpile by one chip, and it is replenished through captures or gifts from other players. Players have some measure of control over who plays next, but captures either benefit another player or require that another player chooses to let you make a capture.&#10;&#10;Players may form any non-binding agreements provided that all discussion is done at the table.  Working together allows players to capture chips and force other players out of the game.  In the end, one player must betray their coalitions to win.&#10;&#10;The authors are also responsible for inventing the dollar auction and a great deal of economic theory.&#10;&#10;",

There are three segments per turn in which each player must begin by deciding whether they will move and then attack or attack and then move.  Not only is combat strength compared but also a unit's tactical rating when resolving combats.  The side with the higher tactical rating gets to draw more random chits most of which have beneficial drms for that side. To a limited extent combat losses can be converted into retreats and enemy retreats can occasionally result in an additional advance for the attacker.  Occasionally, extreme die rolls allow additional spontaneous activities.  ZoCs are hard except friendly units allow tracing supply through them.  Loss of supply reduces unit effectiveness and can result in attrition.  Victory is determined mostly by units losses but also the Soviet control of objective cities and the presence of even one friendly unit on the other players side of the Donets river provides a healthy number of VPs.
