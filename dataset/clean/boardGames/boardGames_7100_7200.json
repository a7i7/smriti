Napol&eacute;on was able to reconstitute an army of 300,000 men by summoning to the colors those young soldiers who soon came to be called by the name &laquo; Marie-Louise &raquo;. Europe formed a coalition against France: Prussia and Russia wanted to crush Napol&eacute;on permanently. Despite his victories during the spring and summer, Austria soon joined the side of the Empire&rsquo;s enemies. Gigantic maneuvers and great battles followed one after the other within the triangle formed by Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden. Whereas his victories were no longer decisive, Napol&eacute;on knew now that a single defeat could pull down his Empire !&#10;&#10;",

If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.&#10;&#10;Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck.

The player who starts a competition must choose to either play one Action card or pass.&#10;&#10;Action cards consist of animals played to the table as well as events. Animals contribute their Food Chain values towards gaining valuable victory points at the various Biomes, and use their element icons to fight for control of the six Element resource cards. Animals can also sometimes suppress other animals, turning them from Healthy to Endangered, or Endangered to Extinct. Event cards can be powerful one-time effects or ongoing effects that last throughout the round.&#10; Play proceeds clockwise around the table in like fashion until every player has passed consecutively or when any one player has passed with an empty hand. At that point Element cards and the current Biome card are scored, with victorious players recording their gains on the Victory Point Track. If the competition is at a Tundra, one or more dominant players will advance one space on the Survival Track.&#10;&#10;The current Biome card as well as all played Action cards are then discarded, and a new Biome card brought into play. Finally, each player draws (and perhaps discards) new Action cards based on his position on the Survival Track, and a new competition round begins.

Your gang consists of three different classes of cowboys with different strengths: greenhorns, gunslingers, and trail bosses. Cowboys ride into town to gain control of (annex) buildings and fight other gangs' cowboys in shootouts.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the town of Deadwood consists of the Town Hall, the Church, the Sheriff's Office, the Saloon, and four other randomly drawn buildings. Additional buildings are constructed whenever a cowboy annexes the Town Hall. Each building has at least one unique ability that is used immediately, with some buildings offering more long-term advantages.&#10;&#10;A cowboy accesses these advantages by controlling the building. To gain control a player simply places one of his gang on a building tile, &quot;annexing&quot; it. Other gang leaders can try to gain control of your buildings through shootouts. The player that instigates the shootout receives a Wanted Poster token; the more cowboys you try to kill off, the more Wanted Poster tokens you collect, and the higher the fine you must pay at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Deadwood can end one of three ways: the Train Station is placed on the board once the railroad is built and completed, there are no more Wanted Poster tokens in the Crime Pool, or any player has no more cowboys alive.

The idea for this and future volumes is that we will take multiple existing games from the VPG Napeoleonic 20 series, add an as-yet-unpublished game to the mix, and create a GMT boxed game with 3-4 games in the box, using larger (3/4&quot;) counters and GMT production.&#10;&#10;The Napoleonic 20 game system from Victory Point Games features lower-level wargame complexity on maps where, generally, 20 pieces or fewer are in play at one time (total, for both sides).  This creates tense, dramatic and fast-playing situations on the board where higher echelon troop formations (generally corps) vie for position and dominance. Subscribers to C3i have recently enjoyed Jena 20, a game in this series which features eight pages of Standard rules and one-to-two pages of exclusive rules per title.&#10; Veteran game designer Joe Miranda, with developers Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan, have created and refined a highly popular game series that is growing all the time. (Based on Joe's series rules, Alan, Lance, and Steve Carey have each designed one of the games in this multi-pack - in addition to Joe's Waterloo game.) A hallmark feature is the use of narrative random event cards that help &ldquo;tell the stories&rdquo; unique to each battle and small campaign. This &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; element, combined with the operational-level maneuvers, combat, and even lulls, provide players a fun exercise in the Napoleonic parry-and-thrust of grand battles as armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first.&#10;&#10;This edition includes the latest version (3.0) of the Standard series rules.&#10; Morale plays an vital role, as both sides can &lsquo;spend&rsquo; this resource to force march their units, help rally stragglers, or commit reserves to a key attack or defense. But look out&hellip; when a side&rsquo;s morale is reduced to zero, it has lost the game!&#10;&#10;Included in this Multi-Pack are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Salamanca 20 (Wellington vs. Marmont, 1812)&#10;    Smolensk 20 (Napoleon vs. Barclay de Tolly in the near-battle to decide the Russian Campaign, 1812)&#10;    Borodino 20 (Napoleon vs. Kutusov before Moscow, 1812)&#10;    Waterloo 20 (Napoleon vs. Blucher and Wellington, 1815) &#10;&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Four 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; mounted  maps (2 boards, backprinted)&#10;    117  3/4&quot;  Counters (thick, with Rounded corners, like No Retreat)&#10;    48 Event cards (12 for each game)&#10;    One 8-page Standard Rules booklet&#10;    4 Exclusive Rules sheets&#10;    One Player&rsquo;s Aid mat&#10;    Two Player Aid charts&#10;    2 six-sided Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGN: Joe Miranda&#10;DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich &amp; Lance McMillan&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Vanguard).&#10;&#10;In the game, players &quot;ride&quot; a unit as their Vanguard, which represents them on the board. They may also summon other units as Rear Guards to attack or support. The game is won by doing 6 points of damage to the opponent's Vanguard.&#10;&#10;As players attack, if they are using their vanguard they can &quot;drive check&quot; whereby they check the top card of their deck for &quot;triggers&quot; which increase power and have other effects, and add these cards to their hand. Triggers can also be revealed when players take damage to their vanguard by performing a &quot;damage check&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player places their grade 0 starting vanguard face down in the &quot;vanguard circle&quot; and then draws 5 cards. They may return any number of cards to the deck and re-draw to form their starting hand, but only once. It's a good tactic to return trigger cards from your first hand as these are better utilised when drawn from the deck as part of a &quot;drive check&quot; or &quot;damage check&quot;.&#10;&#10;Once the players are done setting up their initial hand they determine who goes first (often, rock-paper-scissors is used for this) and then each turn follows the same turn order:&#10;&#10;1.

You make your money by peddling these counterfeit pardons to Pilgrims traveling the road to Canterbury. Perhaps you can persuade the Knight that his pride must be forgiven? Surely the Friar's greed will net you a few coins? The Miller's wrath and the Monk's gluttony are on full public display and demand pardoning! The Wife of Bath regales herself in luxury, the Man-of-Law languishes in idleness, and that Prioress has envy written all over her broad forehead. And the naughty stories these Pilgrims tell each other are so full of iniquity they would make a barkeep blush! Pardoning such wickedness should be easy money, right?&#10;&#10;Not quite. For you to succeed as a pardoner, you'll need to do more than just sell forged pardons for quick cash. To keep your services in demand, you will actually need to lead these Pilgrims into temptation yourself! Perhaps some phony relics might help? There is also one big catch. The Seven Deadly Sins live up to their name: each sin that a Pilgrim commits brings Death one step nearer, and a dead Pilgrim pays no pardoners!&#10;&#10;So much to forgive, so little time.

Salt produced in the mines has to be loaded onto ships and used to preserve herring and cod fished in the Atlantic Ocean. Every week ships full of salt barrels leave Rouen for the fishing grounds of the Atlantic Ocean, and once back, the goods are sold in the city markets. The players represent city merchants, and they invest in ships and city buildings to try to get rich. Who will be the richest merchant of Rouen, when Francis I, King of France, comes to visit the City?&#10;&#10;In Upon a Salty Ocean, players start the game with one caravel loaded with three salt barrels, a salt mine and 10-16 money. From this, they must build a shipping empire! The game lasts five turns, with each turn being divided into three phases.&#10;&#10;In the event phase, players adjust prices on the market based on the current event tile, take into the account the weather and environmental conditions that will affect them the remainder of the round, and reveal the event tile for the subsequent round.&#10;&#10;The action phase lasts a variable number of rounds depending on how many actions players want to take and can afford. Eight actions are available and they're divided into four types:&#10;&#10;&#10;    City: (1) buy a saline and (2) buy a building&#10;    Navigation: (1) travel to the ocean and fish and (2) travel to Rouen&#10;    Harbor: (1) build a ship and (2) move goods&#10;    Market: (1) sell to the market and (2) buy from the market&#10;&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he can take any one of the either actions or pass; the cost of an action is the number of times this type of action has been performed previously during this round. For example, the first use of a City action costs 0, while the next use (whether to buy a saline or a building) costs 1. A player who passes can take an action later in the same phase. The action phase ends once all players pass. A player can go into debt during a turn, paying one coin in interest when doing so; as long as the player is in the black once the action round ends (by selling to the market), no further payment is due.&#10;&#10;In the turn end phase, players produce salt, may use special buildings, pay interest (if needed), reset the cost of the actions to zero, and so on. A player can have no more than 40 coins at the end of a turn unless he owns a banque, and the limit is 80 coins without owning Salle des Coffres. This limit is important as the player with the most coins after five rounds wins. Some buildings provide endgame bonuses to which the coin limit doesn't apply.&#10;&#10;",

Those who don't make it become monsters you must destroy.&#10;&#10;Malifaux is a character-driven 32mm tabletop miniatures game.  Players lead groups, called Crews, in skirmish attacks against their opponents in the magical realm of Malifaux.  Players collect, build, and paint models representing the denizens of Malifaux and pit these Crews against one another.  Masters, powerful practitioners of magic, and those fighting them control these Crews.&#10;&#10;Masters can manipulate the course of events in the world around them, and can change their own fates, through their control or theft of the powerful Soulstones in Malifaux.  A Crew conssists of a variety of fantastic and frightening beings, collectively known as Minions, who serve the Master as fodder in his or her machinations.  In addition, Henchmen can lead specialized Crews in their Master's absence, or serve their Master directly as a member of a Crew.  Masters and Henchmen are also supported by Totems, extension of their magical abilities which increase their spellcasting range and provide additional aid in an Encounter.&#10;&#10;How well a Crew carries out its leader's Strategy and Schemes determiens whether or not it will emerge victgorious in an Encounter with an enemy Crew.  Strategies represent the Crew's main path to victory, while Schemes are simpler alternate routes to achieve the leader's goals.&#10;&#10;Malifaxu players use decks of cards called Fate Decks to resolve game events such as attacking and spell casting.  Players can manipulate the cards they play to alter the Duel's outcome.  It takes a shrewd leader to effectively utilize a Crew's resources, ensuring he or she always has ready the cards needed to Cheat Fate.&#10;&#10;Be Prepared to fight to the death because Malifaux is the end of the line!&#10;&#10;",

This world enclosed a treasure that was going to revolutionize modern sciences, namely the Somnium, an orange luminescent crystal showing amazing properties. It can be used as fuel, affects matter and even time. Immediately, this virgin land became a new Eldorado for European colonists.

After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.&#10;&#10;In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.&#10;&#10;Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.&#10;&#10;",

That was two centuries ago.&#10;&#10;Now the barons and the princes swear loyalty to whichever claimant-emperor garrisons the nearest army today. The clergy sell their sermons for the highest bidder, and spies whisper promises to mercenary generals.&#10;&#10;You are the one true ruler of the broken Empire of Lyssan, and it's up to you to put the pretenders (the other players) in their place before their endless squabbling tears your nation apart. You (and others) will attempt to take control by using castles, knights, nobles, priests, and spies:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Knights hold territory and fight masterfully.&#10;    Nobles hold territory, support priests, and fight poorly.&#10;    Castles hold territory, spawn new units, and protect knights and nobles.&#10;    Priests manipulate influence and support spies.&#10;    Spies assassinate priests and other spies, and have the devastating power to steal other players' court cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Lyssan is an intense board game of strategy, cooperation, and betrayal for two to four players. The winner is the player who claims the most trophies, and each trophy can only be claimed by a single player. One trophy card might call for the player to control the most mines, the next to have most spies deployed, and the next to have the most sophisticated court. An upcoming trophy is revealed each turn, requiring strength, cunning, and adaptability to win.&#10;&#10;Lyssan combines tightly designed euro-style rules with the interactivity and flavor of an epic wargame. Lyssan has slim rules comparable to many family friendly games. Yet the play is as rich and interactive as the crunchiest, most grognard-friendly wargames. And Lyssan plays fast. A typical game of Lyssan runs a full hour quicker than comparable games.&#10;&#10;Lyssan combines: &#10;A map to be conquered (like Risk)... &#10;...with a few different unit types that act a few different ways each (like Chess or Diplomacy) ... &#10;...with cards that let players pull off devastating surprise moves or permanently improve their abilities. To play one card, you discard others. (Like Race for the Galaxy) These cards can be very powerful, but they can also be stolen by spies. The whole landscape of the game can change in the blink of an eye as ownership of a card changes hands. Get one of your spies into a rival's castle, and you can take over his improvements or turn his own followers against him.&#10;&#10;All interrupting effects have been stripped out of the game, so each player can complete their turn quickly, without waiting for the others. The game has been designed from the start to allow timed play, like a tournament chess match. This is good for players who want extra-brisk play, or who just have one slowpoke at the table who needs to be reined in.&#10;&#10;",

Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Will it be the elder of the group, or shall the greatest warrior have it?

The winner is the most drunk samurai &ndash; in game terms, the player who has collected the most Sake drink counters &ndash; at the end of the Sudden Death round.&#10;&#10;Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the sword. Each drink of Sake prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the Sake you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much Sake, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the Masu is empty and the Sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Enma, the thirsty god of death, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their Sake.

Redakai cards have Blast 3D technology, making them appear 3D, as well as making attacks appear to animate as the player moves the card.&#10;&#10;In Redakai, a player is trying to eliminate the character(s) controlled by the opponent to win the game. In the basic game, each player starts with one character and on a turn you draw a card from your deck, then play it immediately. The card types are monster &ndash; which are played on your own character to boost defenses and heal damage &ndash; and attack &ndash; which are played on the opponent's character. A character can have defenses in three colors &ndash; green, red, blue &ndash; and if an attack is stronger than a character's defense in that attack's color, then the attack hits and damages the character.&#10;&#10;The cards are transparent and they stack on top of each other during play. A character's health is represented by three damage zones on the card, and if all these zones turn red (by playing one or more attacks on that character), then the character is eliminated. An attack can also cover up and remove a character's defense, while monsters can boost defenses and cover red damage zones with yellow ones, thus healing the character.&#10;&#10;In the advance game, each player controls three characters and starts with a hand of three cards and a maximum Kairu value of three. Each turn, a player boosts his maximum Kairu by one (to a maximum of 20), draws one card, then (optionally) plays monster and attack cards, spending Kairu to do so equal to the cost on each card. Some cards have &quot;react&quot; abilities that allow you to spend Kairu to defend against attacks. At the start of each turn, your Kairu refreshes to its maximum value.&#10;&#10;If you eliminate all three of your opponent's characters, you win the game.

Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side.

While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too.

If a single player has more cards in the center of the table then anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &quot;bonus&quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.&#10;&#10;Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round.

It is 1025, and the emperor Basileios II has ascended into the heavens without providing for an heir. In Constantinople, representatives from the most important aristocratic families vie for their favored to inherit the Emperor's ring and throne.&#10;&#10;It is a futile and petty dispute as each family is not about to surrender the throne to any of the others, but they ultimately decide that the winner will be the one who's supported by most of the wealthiest cities of the empire. Every ambitious successor raises the banner of  his dynasty and begins the struggle to win over the cities that will secure him the throne.&#10;&#10;Each family secretly chooses seven imperial cities that they will seek to control through the actions available to them: Commandment, Diplomacy, Exile, Trade, Garrison, Espionage, and Corruption.

United in the capital city Nekken, they slowly forgot their fear of the large volcano that looms over the metropolis &ndash; until the volcano erupted. Forced to abandon their homes, the tribes spread throughout the continent, facing danger in many forms while trying to establish new colonies. Their ancient hatred has also been awakened and now they must struggle to survive. However, they still need each other, a new cold war emerges in the shadow of the searing heat of the volcano.&#10;&#10;In Nekken, each player takes the role of a leader of their tribe and tries to be the one who will prevail and become the ruler of this new society. The goal is to achieve prestige through the establishment of new and glorious cities, using actions to move their leader on the map, exploring, establishing cities, betraying friends to achieve their objective. Hopefully no other ruler intends on settling in the same place!&#10;&#10;",

When a player steals an open gift they hold it in their hand until a new gift is opened. This way a gift may be stolen only once until a new card is turned over. When a new card is turned over all stolen gift cards are placed face up so the next player may steal any opened gift.&#10;&#10;This continues until the last gift is opened.

Players win the game by obtaining the most power over the city in a race against the game system that creates a living city in which crime and other challenges await at every corner.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of an action phase, which is preceded by an upkeep phase. During this action phase, players score power by successfully eliminating assassins, turning in crime bosses, and defusing high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy whole districts. Through investigation of city areas, players gather resources that will be vital for survival. Positioning collaborators in the different locations of the city aids agents in overcoming confrontations with local thugs.

The Agency, however, has its own air defenses it can call in for support.&#10;&#10;Players can scout locations in search for valuable resources that will help them upgrade their abilities, to get more control over the challenges in the game.

Some of you might be android agents, secretly planning a revolt. Through careful investigation, players can gather intelligence about the true identity of other players. As the game progresses, traitors amongst the agents could be revealed in the form of androids.

With civil war looming as a near inevitability, the challenge was to find a way forward after years of degenerating political discourse in the increasingly divided American electorate. In the end, after months of contentious campaigning between four (!) major parties and over a dozen smaller ones, the election was won by the Republican dark horse candidate, a little known Illinois politician named Abraham Lincoln who hadn't even been the first choice of his party's senior leadership.&#10;&#10;Divided Republic is a card driven two to four player game representing the last calm before the storm that was to become the American Civil War. Players represent the four major parties (Constitutional Unionists, Northern Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Democrats) and attempt to win the presidency by defeating their opponents with dirty tricks, platform speeches, and the manipulation of key historical events. All the while, President Buchanan interferes, radicals riot, and the country continues the downward spiral toward civil war. If one party wins the election by achieving the necessary 152+ electoral votes, or wins in the case of an electoral tie thrown to the US Congress, history may well change. Nevertheless, there is always the chance that the population of South Carolina will finally explode into open rebellion and secede, ending the game, at which point everyone loses!&#10;&#10;This is a light to medium weight game with intense player interaction, card-driven play, and a play time of about 2-3 hours depending upon how events proceed. There are even a few laughs along the way as the mudslinging between parties heats up. Literally anyone can win - it's not simply a cut and dry Republican victory. This is a different kind of US election game, a game where there are not two, but four parties, set in a period when candidates did not generally campaign for themselves, and run in an era when the Republicans were still liberals and the Democrats were the vanguard of traditional American conservatism.&#10;&#10;",

This game is actually two complete modules in one: it includes a complete revision and augmentation of Stonewall Jackson's Way (SJW; the first game in the series), and an entire new module covering the First Bull Run Campaign, called All Green Alike (AGA).&#10;&#10;The two maps included are newly painted by original map artist Charlie Kibler and include new historical and terrain details (to bring them up to the standards of the latest games in the GCACW series).&#10;&#10;Stonewall Jackson&rsquo;s Way II: Battles of Bull Run uses the same GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that were first published in MMP's The Skirmisher #1 and Grant Takes Command.

Players are investors buying private companies in auctions, which they may later use for an IPO (to turn them into corporations) or sell to already existing corporations (to turn them into subsidiaries of that corporation). The majority share holder of a corporation controls its actions: issuing new shares, paying dividends, and buying more subsidiaries from other corporations, players, or an ominous foreign investor.&#10;&#10;The companies are transportation themed, starting with the early Prussian railroad. As more companies are bought, the scope of the game expands to Germany, later Europe, and ultimately even space. With expanding scope, older companies become less and less profitable until they have to be written off eventually, severely hitting the book value of their owner.&#10;&#10;As a pure card game, Rolling Stock has no game board to simulate actual transportation. Instead, networking effects are modeled by synergies between geographically adjacent companies that are subsidiaries of the same corporation. This simplistic model merely sets the stage for the trading of stocks and companies, which is the heart and soul of the game.&#10;&#10;Rolling Stock is vaguely inspired by the 18xx series of games but it is clearly not a part of it. Obviously, track building is missing entirely, but even the stock market with all its superficial similarities turns out to be fundamentally different.&#10;&#10;Compared to the 18xx series, Rolling Stock has extremely simple rules.

Mix a few drinks, rack up the magical monkey points, and crown yourself king of the Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge.&#10;&#10;Score monkeys to hang on your martini glass by adding Jivecat contacts to your clique and claiming Trend cards through skillful manipulation of your lounge contacts. Be the player with the most monkeys at the end of the round in which a player scores their fifteenth monkey and be crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of four cards and on their turn use those cards for their face value to claim low-brow contacts in the lounges or use the card's special powers to claim Jivecat contacts and cast spells (Zombie, Rada, Cheval, and Voodoo).  For example, a 4 Zombie can be used to claim a &quot;4&quot; contact in the Lava Lounge. Card values can be added and subtracted from each other, allowing players to pinpoint just the right contacts to advance their plans.&#10;&#10;However, the player could use the card for its Zombie spell, instead. By paying a skull, they can place the card in their tableau as an extension of their hand allowing them to use that card's value for many turns in the future.&#10;&#10;In these ways, players create &quot;cliques&quot; of linked contacts in and among the four cocktail lounges (Lava, Cocoa, Tiki, and Neptune) trying to schmooze their way to the Jivacat contacts that score points. The contacts are limited though, so several players may be angling for a specific Jivecat.&#10;&#10;During play, a series of Skull Cards allow players to gain skull token reward that power their voodoo spells, and a Trend Card track presents players with monkey rewards for achieving specific contact configurations. The Trend cards also provide special bonus abilities to the players if they can maintain the required configurations.&#10;&#10;Each player has a martini glass to hold the contact chips and scores are kept through hanging cocktail monkeys on the rim of the player's glass. Orange monkeys are 1 point and blue monkeys are 5 points.&#10;&#10;Game end is triggered when one player reaches fifteen monkey points. The round is completed, bonus monkeys are rewarded for trends that have been maintained, and the player with the most monkeys wins.&#10;&#10;To add to the cocktail themed fun, each card also has a different cocktail recipe for adult players to mix and enjoy.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, after rolling the dice and laying out new fragments to discover, players secretly assign one of their four movement cards (numbered 1-4) to each of their three experts. In turn order, players reveal the first card, move that figure clockwise or counterclockwise that number of spaces around the circle of ten tiles, then reveal the second card, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once all experts have moved, the tiles are resolved in numerical order. Any player who stands on a tile with no competition takes all the fragments located there; if more than one player is on a tile, the player with the most experts either takes all the fragments on that tile or one face-down fragment from another player on that tile. After a player takes or steals fragments, he can choose to use the special power on that tile: break a tie in your favor on another tile, take a fragment from the pool, move one expert owned by another player one space, and so on.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, only four of the tiles are face-up with active powers; in the advanced game, these same four tiles start face-up but at the end of a round the starting player turns one tile of his choice face-up before passing the starting player marker.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player collects all four different fragments of one artifact, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Playing cards will impact, among other things, the ranking of the Houses in terms of prestige.

You play as one of the great monarchs from 17th and early 18th century Europe representing one of the seven top powers of the era: Austria, England, France, Poland, Russia, Spain, or Sweden. Your objective is to be recognized as the most prestigious monarch by producing the most admired art and culture, lead the continent in scientific innovations, spread or resist the spread of Catholicism, and attempt military expansion beyond your historical borders. All of this is accomplished by marshaling 134 historical &quot;luminaries&quot; &ndash; important historical figures covering every relevant domain of human achievement during the period.&#10;&#10;The luminaries are rated in between one and seven different areas of endeavour: military, politics, religion, ideas, science, art, or wealth. Additionally, each luminary has a unique Action, Enhancement, or Response based on their real historical achievements to be brought to bear in service of your nation.&#10;&#10;Consider the difference between Rembrandt and Vermeer: Both are important and wonderful artists, but in the real-life Dutch Republic, Rembrandt was famous and well-patronized, composing hundreds of celebrated portraits in his career. Vermeer was obscure and produced an order of magnitude less art in his career. In Road to Enlightenment, Rembrandt has higher ratings and gives you a benefit every single time another luminary is removed from the game, reflecting the influence and nature of his portraiture. On the other hand, Vermeer provides only a modest benefit to reflect the limited impact his career had at the time.&#10;&#10;Invading other countries in the 17th century was a complex mix of cultural, religious, and logistical considerations. These have all been baked into the various territories on the map, making it quick and easy to make decisions around where to try to attack:&#10;&#10;&#10;     You can attempt to invade only those territories that have your nation's colour on the top of the circle. Those are the only nations that could have even possibly successfully invaded that territory in real-life.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The number associated with each nation's colour indicates how difficult it would be to successfully conquer. In the case of London, it is very difficult for Spain, France, or Sweden to conquer it.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The religious symbol in the lower left corner lets the player know whether the territory is primarily Catholic, primarily Anti-Catholic (Protestant, Russian Orthodox, and other Christian branches), or primarily Islamic. If it is successfully invaded by a nation with a different religious affiliation, it has an impact on the continental struggle between religions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The lines connecting into London, and the anchor with an &quot;A&quot; in the lower right corner, indicate which territories need to be held by a player before they have access to attack. The anchor with an &quot;A&quot; indicates that any player who already owns another Atlantic port territory is connected and could choose to attack over the water.&#10;&#10;&#10;With Road to Enlightenment, all of the intricacies related to managing military expansion have been baked into these easy-to-use board mechanisms.&#10;&#10;In order to create a game that simulates the battle between nations for prestige &ndash; covering war, politics, religion, science, and art &ndash; while focusing on many of the diverse people of history, we've mashed up aspects from wargames, Euro games, deck-building games, and statistical sports simulations. While it is an eclectic mix, this broad spectrum approach to the game's design enabled this diverse and richly detailed set of conditions to come together in a game that is epic in scale but doesn't take all day to play.&#10;&#10;The full game is for 3-7 players; the pocket version is for 2-4.&#10;&#10;",

The cutters divide the pizza into one of 216 possible outcomes, creating a number of slices.

Can he eliminate the innocent and arrest the culprit before the injunction expires?&#10;&#10;In this game, you get to play as Inspector Moss, exploring a 25-room house consisting of tiles. Each tile contains either a suspect, evidence that can be used to eliminate suspects, or something to assist you in solving the case in time.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you roll 7 white dice and 1 colored &quot;time&quot; die up to 3 times. You may then use up to 6 of the dice for movement (by matching the number on the destination tile), for gathering evidence (with any 4 consecutive dice), and for getting assistance (with any 3 matching dice). After performing any actions, you must move the time marker down a number of spaces equal to the number shown on the time die plus 1 minute for every wild 6 that was used for an action.&#10;&#10;There are 10 possible suspects in the game. Once you have collected enough evidence to eliminate 9 of them, you must arrest the remaining suspect and escort him/her to the waiting police car. If you can do all of this before time runs out, you win the game.&#10;&#10;",

If your agents arrest him too soon, you will not have gathered enough evidence or figured out what to charge him with. If you wait too long, however, you may be too late to stop his nefarious plans.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to gather the right information in time?

        "description": "The King's birthday has arrived! Wealthy aristocrats from across the land have gathered to throw a lavish ball in the King's honor, sparing no expense in an attempt to impress him. Of course, everyone knows that the best way to impress a father is to win the favor of his daughters. At the ball, one more bit of business needs to be settled &ndash; each aristocrat has bet a parcel of land that he can curry the most favor from the seven sisters over the course of the party! With their land and honor on the line, each aristocrat is rushing to gain the favor of the daughters, and to cast derision on his opponents.&#10;&#10;In Seven Sisters, a hand-management, area-control Euro-style board game, the players play the roles of wealthy aristocrats who are trying to gain the favor of the king's seven daughters, who happen to be named after the seven deadly sins: Wrath, Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, Pride, and Envy.&#10;  &#10;The game consists of four rounds, with the players being dealt six cards each round. Using five of the six cards, players influence the sisters by sending servants to do the sisters' bidding. Multiple options when playing each card create opportunities for players to use both strategic and tactical play to influence the sisters more than their opponents do.&#10;&#10;Each round after cards are played, scoring occurs with each sister granting her favor (victory point) and a special reward or action to the player who has influenced her most that round. These rewards and actions are thematically tied to the name of the sister (e.g., Greed rewards players with gold). Gaining this favor is important not only for the victory point, but also to gain advantages and resources for following rounds.&#10;&#10;After four rounds are played and scored, another scoring round happens immediately. Victory points are tallied, including bonus points for having gained the favor of all seven sisters and for having the highest quantity of unused resources remaining (gold, fruit, and servants). The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;It is 1926, and the museum's extensive collection of exotic curios and occult artifacts poses a threat to the barriers between our world and the elder evils lurking between dimensions. Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.&#10;&#10;Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.&#10;&#10;To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "String Railway: Transport is a follow-up game to String Railway, a train game in which the play area is created by placing varying lengths of colored string representing different types of terrain. The board is initially seeded with all the stations (unlike in String Railway) placed randomly inside the boundary string and filled with two goods cubes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players must place one string that connects stations. Then players have a number of action points to use. Players start with a 3 AP locomotive, and can upgrade to better locomotives that provide up to 6 AP per turn. Action points are used to moving goods cubes (1 AP to move from station to station). If a cube reaches a station of the same colour as the cube itself, the cube is then scored.&#10;&#10;White cubes are special long distance cubes. Players have mission cards that show three stations in particular order. In order to fulfill the mission, the player must move a long-distance cube through the stations in right order. The reward depends on how many stations player moves the cube through. Unfulfilled mission is worth -2. Moving the cube through one station gets rid of the penalty. Two stations gets rid of the penalty and gives the player the white cube, which is scored as a wild cube. Three stations scores 5 points on top of that.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the cubes are scored. Each set of five cubes of different colours is worth 15 points, 4-cube sets are 10 points, 3-cube sets are 6 points, 2-cube sets are 3 points and remaining single cube sets give 1 point each. White wild cubes can be very useful at this point. Unfulfilled missions are -2 points, while perfectly fulfilled missions are +5 points.&#10;&#10;In addition of moving cubes, action points can be used for upgrading locomotives and replenishing goods cubes. Collected goods cubes can be discarded to gain AP. Players can also draw new mission cards and each player has a personal station they can place on board at some point in game.&#10;&#10;String Railway: Transport, with a playing time of approx. 15 minutes per player, differs from the original game by adding cargo delivery and removing the values of stations. Transport is an individual game, not an expansion. The games are not compatible: you can't play String Railway with the components of Transport (the stations are different and there's no river).&#10;&#10;",

After each player picks an action card in secret, players act in order of initiative, counting down from eight to seven to six, etc., with a player calling out their action when their initiative number is called. (In the event of a tie, you refer to values on the individuals cards to see who acts first.) Faster characters tend to be weaker, but ideally they can get their best shots in first, with dice being rolled to determine the results of various attacks.&#10;&#10;Each character card is unique with four characteristics important for attacks &mdash; melee attack, ranged attack, speed, initiative &mdash; and each character has two unique actions to inflict on others!&#10;&#10;",
