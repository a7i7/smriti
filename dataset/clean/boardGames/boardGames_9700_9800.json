Or just look at fish other players already discovered... Maybe they will even find treasure! But be careful not to lose your mask or get bitten by an octopus... Make dust so other players can't find any fish that turn. And be wary of currents sweeping all fish around the board. And even more important, keep an eye on your air at all times! If you plan badly and use all your air while still diving, you won't live to tell your stories...&#10;&#10;",

In Westeros, the death of Robert Baratheon has created a power vacuum with rival Houses competing for control of The Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen is building an army to contest the rule of the Ghiscari slavers, before returning to reclaim The Iron Throne. There are 3 different ways to play RISK Game of Thrones:&#10;&#10;1. SKIRMISH&#10;Basic version designed as an introduction to RISK Game of Thrones game play. Once you are comfortable, move on to Dominion.&#10;&#10;2. DOMINION&#10;Advanced version of RISK Game of Thrones including Objectives, Characters, and Maester cards, offering more in-depth strategic action.&#10;&#10;3. WORLD AT WAR&#10;Play with both maps and up to seven players using either the Skirmish or Dominion rules.&#10;&#10;RISK Game of Thrones includes two game board maps and seven House armies. Westeros map is for 3-5 player game and Essos map is for 2 player game. There is a deck of territory cards for each map, and these function in a similar way to the original RISK gameplay. When playing Dominion rules, the character cards can grant special abilities to your House, the maester cards can grant tactical advantages during deployment and battles, and objective cards create goals and strategies for earning Victory Points.&#10;&#10;Skirmish rules are most similar to the original RISK rules. There are minor thematic variations to suit the new map. The winner is determined by which player controls the most territories, castles and ports when the end game card is revealed.&#10;&#10;Dominion rules add the additional mechanics and cards described above. Instead of simply trying to control the most territories, castles, and ports you are now trying to achieve specific Objectives to earn Victory Points, furthering your efforts to consolidate power and establish dominion over the rival Houses. Objectives are worth from 1 to 4 Victory Points, based on the difficulty to achieve them. The first player to earn 10 Victory Points while also controlling their Seat of Power wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you roll six dice (three white and three black); two dice (one white and one black) form an action. Every roll you must pick exactly two dice to take out (any colour). In the end you combine the six dice any way you want, no matter in which order you chose to take them out of your rolls beforehand. You can use only two actions on your turn. On your development sheet you enter the actions chosen for this turn and note your points. You can also decide to &quot;expand your lab&quot; which will give you bonus actions or points. Other players may pick any action combination from your dice roll to add to their sheet. Do not forget to fight Octopodes ;) The game ends when each player had 6 turns.

Each player has an identical set of eight cards, each of them with a special effect.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a round, the common supply on the board becomes more attractive by adding seals (victory points) and wares and by improving the ratio to change wares into seals. All players choose one card from their hand simultaneously and place it face down in front of them (two cards in a two- or three-player game). Then the cards are revealed and the effects become active:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Knights and Troops take victory points;&#10;     Blacksmith gets wares for each Knight/Troops played by other players;&#10;     Ships and Fleets get wares; Tollkeeper gets seals for ships and fleets;&#10;     Merchant changes wares into seals;&#10;     Monk gets wares for merchants and number of cards already played.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players with a monk take all cards back to their hand, while others proceed with their remaining cards.&#10;&#10;The specific issue is that the more efficient cards become effective only after those which are not that strong. For example, a fleet gets you three wares, but the ship gets you all the remaining ones. If there are ten wares and one opponent played a fleet, you get the seven remaining wares after he has taken three. If three other players play a fleet and take three wares each, you gain only one for your ship. How effective your card is depends on what the other players do &mdash; but you cannot be sure of what they'll do because all decisions are made simultaneously.

With each turn, you defeat monsters, disarm traps, and open doors as you explore a dark dungeon. Along the way you collect treasure, gain skills, even use magic. But death awaits those who linger too long, and if all your torches burn out you will be lost in the dungeon forever. The objective is to find the tomb hoards of four ancient kings, collect as much additional treasure as possible, and make it out alive.&#10;&#10;The spread is the standard layout for the game. At the top of the spread is an area where you play torches (A), as they appear. In the middle of the spread is the dungeon area itself. Turns descending into the dungeon are played in a row from left to right. This row is called the delve. The turns ascending from the depths of the dungeon are played underneath the delve from right to left, with one turn for each turn of the delve except the turn-around point. This is called the retreat. Below the dungeon area, from left to right are a discard area, a hit point counter, and a hand where you collect your treasure, tomb hoards, skill cards, and magic scroll.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into turns. Each turn, you play a series of cards in the dungeon area. The turn represents an encounter as you explore the vast and sprawling dungeon. Layer the cards in a column while the turn is active. When the turn is over, stack those cards face down before moving on to the next turn. Each turn starts by playing cards from the deck until an encounter card appears.&#10;&#10;If you make it out of the dungeon alive, add up all the treasure in your hand.  If you found all four kings and survived, you have won the game, regardless of points. Multiply total points by 100 to calculate the value of your treasure in gold pieces.&#10;&#10;",

And can you end the hunt at the most opportune time, perhaps by actually wakening the fearsome beast?&#10;&#10;Hoard is a dynamic game of hand management, set collection, and press-your-luck. Each turn players take one of four possible actions:  1) roll a custom die and move to take a new card, 2) secure a set of treasures or add to an existing set to score points, 3) affect the dragon, who wakes in stages from his tail to his head, by playing cards that soothe or rouse him, or 4) use a sword on an opponent or capture a used sword with a shield. The board is composed of 12 facedown cards surrounding the dragon.  It changes as players remove and replace the cards. Dice rolls between 1-5 enable clockwise or counterclockwise movement and the special symbol allows access to all but one of the cards, so it is a game that rewards memory.&#10;&#10;Hoard is meant to be played in rounds, with scoring tokens obviating the need for pencil and paper scorekeeping.&#10;&#10;A limited run of Hoard was self-published by Tim Kings-Lynne and Beck Veitch in 2014.

Characters and their actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Actors: Rehearse one or more acts in the three-act play; the more you rehearse, the more benefits you receive during the dress rehearsals on days four and six.&#10;    Costume mistress: Take costume elements to enhance your actors; if they lack a complete costume, they can't participate in the dress rehearsals.&#10;    Set dresser: Build the set. The more elaborate the set you build, the more rewards you receive &mdash; but the set must be symmetrical!&#10;    Handyman: Set them to work on whatever you need.

Dress rehearsal on the fourth and sixth days provide another chance for fully-dressed actors to perform, and those who are well-rehearsed earn points or money.&#10;&#10;On all but the final days, players must allow characters who performed to rest, with only one of those characters being able to work the next day. Thus, the more you put them to work today, the less you'll be able to do tomorrow &mdash; but those who don't plan to do as much act before other players, so that might be a good thing.&#10;&#10;In the end, players must pay their actors, with each unpaid actor blemishing your reputation and costing you points.

There are several combination cards in the middle of the table as well as three common dice that will be used by all players. In each round the starting player rolls the middle dice and then all players also have up to three rolls for their own dice, which are rolled behind player's shield. However, if you want to make a roll after your first one, you have to set one die aside, visible to other players. However, if you roll three times your last roll must remain behind the shield - thus each player will have at least one die that is not visible to others.&#10;&#10;When everyone is done with rolling, all players claim, which of the visible combinations they have. The trick is - you can also lie and try to claim a combination, which you don't have. When a player has claimed a combination then all other players in clockwise order have a chance to either accuse him of lying or pass.&#10;&#10;1) If everyone passes then the player scores this combination and receives the points it provides. If he lied and didn't have this combination he can now reveal this fact to others - he still scores the combination as if he had it and he also receives one Successful Liar's card, which gives extra points.&#10;&#10;2) If anyone accuses the player of lying, then he has to reveal his dice, which creates two possibilities:&#10;&#10;If he was not lying then he scores the combination, but the player who accused him takes a False Accusation card, which gives minus points. However, if he was lying then he was accused correctly and doesn't get to score the combination, effectively losing his turn. The accuser doesn't get anything apart from the good feeling that he didn't let the lie slip through.&#10;&#10;Thus each player in a round claims one combination.

The Warchief checks the battlefield, then tries to choose the right order with a card in hand. When both clans have chosen their cards, all of them are revealed, and if both cards match on a clan, then the order is carried out. Some examples of orders: loading the catapult, firing with the catapult, progressing toward the Queen, looking at hidden cards in the middle to find the Queen, and avoiding traps...&#10;&#10;Of course, within a clan it is absolutely prohibited to make any sign or say anything to help the partner to guess which order is intended.&#10;&#10;When playing 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-2, the game is a bit different: The single player team cannot play the same order twice, one turn after another.&#10;&#10;With multiple copies of Goths Save The Queen, you can compete in a 3-vs-3, 3-vs-4 or 4-vs-4 format.&#10;&#10;",

If you&rsquo;re clever enough, you&rsquo;ll be able to take claim over the buildings in the evergrowing boomtowns and gain powerful abilities.

Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources.  Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand.  This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight.

Others have risen to prominence and power within his council. Adept in their machinations and plots, the councilors have their own self serving ambitions. In a shadowy battle of subterfuge they ruthlessly vie against one another for true control of Blackthorn. In this dance of treachery, each must seize as much power as able without drawing suspicion for whispers of treason echo through the halls of the King of Blackthorn.

The player with the most treason points at the end of the game is beheaded for treason and is removed from the game.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...&#10;&#10;",

Even though the sale of alcohol was illegal, alcoholic drinks were still widely available at &quot;speakeasies&quot; and other underground drinking establishments.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Opulent, a posh speakeasy located in vibrant Atlantic City! In The Opulent 1-4 players are tasked with the operations of a successful nightclub during the historic Jazz Age. Each player takes on a distinct role that plays a vital part in the success &mdash; or failure &mdash; of the Opulent. Cater to the recognizable social classes of the 1920s. Politicians, mobsters, aristocrats, and social celebrities are all seeking a grand time in your club. Entertain your patrons with upbeat jazz tempos, or melodic waltzes, with the Opulent jazz band. Fancy the illegal indulgences of your patrons by preparing them an exotic mixed drink, a good whisky on the rocks, or even a simple brew. Pay lookouts to deter Federal Agents seeking to shut the club down. Hire flappers, a chanteuse, cocktail waitress, or other helpful hands and amenities to improve your club.&#10;&#10;Manage the Opulent in ten scenarios dating from 1920-1929 during one of the most historic periods of U.S. history! Each scenario has a dollar value that is associated with the cost of operating The Opulent for that particular year. Players must have enough money in the club coffers to cover this cost in order to win the scenario if playing a single session game, or to progress to the next scenario if players are taking on the Opulent campaign.&#10;&#10;With a focus on theme and history, &quot;The Opulent&quot; is a light cooperative asymmetrical game set during 1920's prohibition where players operate a campaign driven upscale speakeasy.&#10;&#10;",

Play the game and find out...&#10;&#10;Ni&ntilde;a &amp; Pinta is a game of exploration of the New World where the great nations of Spain, England, France and Portugal send ships out to map the unknown and to bring home wealth to the Old World. This is a game where those ships will cross the divide and where no love is lost between Captains no matter which world it is! Explore, settle, fight if need be, and help your nation develop its Culture, Science, Religion and War-craft, to be the best in all worlds!&#10;&#10;No dice rolling in this Ragnar game, but plenty of tension as players can launch offensives with their Captains after first using them to flip land tiles thereby exploring each New World. Settlers are placed in explored lands to generate gold revenue. When combinations of terrain are occupied, towns and cities can be built. Meanwhile gold is used in the Old World to buy items to benefit further New World development or to accumulate the victory points generated by Culture, Science, Religion and War which themselves are meshed with what is taking place in the three New Worlds.&#10;&#10;This is a tightly knit puzzle that will have players pondering a multiplicity of decisions from start to finish. As much of the play is simultaneous and &quot;single-action&quot;, there is little downtime. The game has a good sense of growth worthy of its fascinating theme.&#10;&#10;",
