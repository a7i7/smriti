At the start of a round, someone rolls the two dice &mdash; one showing a number 4-8, the other showing a type of fruit &mdash; then players take turns laying cards in the center of the table, covering the card most recently played. Whenever someone thinks that the stack of cards contains at least as many of the required fruit as shown on the dice, they can slap the stack and reveal the cards. If they're correct, they keep one card face up as a point and distribute the other cards among the opponents; if incorrect, they must keep all of the cards.&#10;&#10;While this part of the game is straightforward, some cards include minions that require you to reroll either the number or fruit die, thereby changing what you're trying to collect in the salad. Can you keep track of everything?&#10;&#10;",

These tiles represent the adventurers who want steal the plunder of the dragon. You are responsible for removing these adventurers from the dungeon. Each turn, you take a tile for yourself and give another tile to another player. The choice of tiles depends on the position of the dragon (as the tile must be in its line or in its column). Then the dragon is moved to the location of the tile that has just been removed. Thus, each tile decision limits the choice of the next tile to take.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player receives a color that they keep secret, with this color corresponding to their original guild. Every tile of this color brings them negative points. Players stack their collected tiles by color, and at the end of the game, the tallest stack is removed. If this stack is the player's guild color, then the player must discard the next tallest stack instead. Players then sum the values of their tiles, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

When the game ends, three trophies are given out, whoever gets the Grand Champion trophy wins!&#10;&#10;Looking For a Wave&#10;At the start of each round all the wave tiles advance one space towards the shore. When looking for a wave to catch, you&rsquo;ll need to remember that you can only catch a broken wave. Waves are either unbroken, or broken.

You want to play a card that will shift your balance so that you do not wipeout during the Wave / Score phase.

While riding, your goal is to maintain your balance, while maximizing scored points. Cards you play will both shift your balance, and count as your score for the wave. The higher the number on the card, the more points it&rsquo;s worth, however the more difficult it will be to maintain your balance. After you play and shift your balance, a wave card will be revealed, and it too will shift your balance. Be careful: if your balance token moves one or more spaces off the nose or tail of your surfboard, you&rsquo;ll wipeout!&#10;&#10;Scoring a Wave &#10;When riding a wave: cards played are not discarded, but placed into your score pile. The numbers on the cards determines the score value of that wave. When you stop riding a wave you will score it during the &ldquo;Wave / Score&rdquo; phase of that round. To score a wave take one of your color score tokens, with the board you&rsquo;re currently riding, and place it on score track at the number equal to your wave score point value, then discard all the cards/tokens in your score pile.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is the all-powerful shaman of a tribe of ferocious, conniving, vicious little cannibals called zimbies, and each player has a single goal: to become the new Cannibal King. To achieve their goal, each player will have to use their zimbies to infiltrate the current King&rsquo;s compound, kill him, take his Crown, and carry it safely to their tribal board before a rival zimby tribe can do so first.&#10;&#10;In solo play, the player must use their zimbies, scrolls, and strategy to defeat the Cannibal King, evade his thugs, and bring the Cannibal Crown to their tribal board before time runs out. In a multiplayer game, the players must work together to gain access to the Cannibal King&rsquo;s sanctum before they can confront him. Once they kill the King, however, it&rsquo;s every tribe for itself and the player that reaches their tribal board with the King&rsquo;s Crown immediately becomes the new Cannibal King and wins the game!&#10;&#10;Keep one eye on the Crown.  Keep the other on your back.&#10;&#10;WHAT'S A ZIMBY?&#10;Zimbies are vicious, conniving little cannibals.  They are small, stubborn, anti-heroes in a game of control of a land of nasty little creatures.  They are not human: each zimby tribe has followed its own cultural and evolutionary path -- there are humanoid zimbies, avian zimbies, aquatic zimbies, simian zimbies, ursine zimbies, arachnid zimbies, the list goes on!  That's why there's a bunch of reptilian-eyed, orange-skinned, clawed, stick-haired creatures on the box!  The name &quot;zimby&quot; itself derives from a play on words on the word &quot;zombie&quot; and the designer's love of the cartoon character Invader Zim, who he feels exquisitely exemplifies zimby behavior and fanaticism.&#10;&#10;MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CONCEPTS AND ELEMENTS&#10;Each player plays the shaman of a different zimby tribe.  Zimbies are nasty, unruly, conniving little cannibals that follow their shaman with fanatical loyalty.  Each player&rsquo;s goal is to bring about the death of the Cannibal King, steal his fallen Crown, and get the Crown to his tribal board so he can become the new Cannibal King.  To do this, the players will have to:&#10;&#10;1. Get some zimbies onto the main game board (you can&rsquo;t get the Crown without a zimby to grab it and carry it home),&#10;2. Cooperate with at least one other tribe to activate a sigil (you can&rsquo;t kill the King unless you can get to him),&#10;3. Kill the Cannibal King (that&rsquo;s the only way he will give up his Crown),&#10;4. Get the Crown and deliver it to your tribal board (you win the game by becoming the new Cannibal King).&#10;&#10;Part 1 of the game is completely cooperative.  Part 2 of the game is completely competitive.&#10;&#10;CREATURES&#10;There are four creature types in the game: zimbies, obnoxious little cannibals that do a shaman&rsquo;s bidding with ruthless (sometimes inept) fanaticism; zombies, undead meat-puppets; thugs, the Cannibal King&rsquo;s dim-witted, fervently devoted brutes; the Cannibal King, the sadistic yet cowardly overlord of the zimby tribes. Shaman are players and don&rsquo;t count as creatures.&#10;&#10;MOJO&#10;Mojo is &quot;a power that may seem magical and allows someone to be very effective, successful, etc.&quot; (Mirriam Webster).  It is the inexplicable, mystical energy than allows shamans to both impel their zimbies into action and release the powerful magical spells bound in the scrolls they raid from the Scroll Library!  But be warned, mojo is drawn from shamans and zimbies!  The more zimbies a shaman sends forth to kill the Cannibal King and steal his Crown, the less mojo that shaman has available!  Every turn, each player (shaman) generates a small amount of mojo and may also draw forth mojo from zimbies on their tribal board, thereby depleting them of energy for the remainder of the turn and rendering them useless. A shaman may also cannibalize (yes, eat!) their own zimbies for more mojo... Of course, eaten zimbies are dead and gone...&#10;&#10;STACKING&#10;Multiple zimbies can stack to form columns which count as single, giant creatures.  The more zimbies in the stack, the stronger they are but the slower they move.  And the shaman whose turn it is fully controls the column...&#10;&#10;SCROLLS, MOVEMENT, AND COMBAT&#10;Shamans may use mojo to empower scrolls to cast one-off rituals, long-lasting incantations, and blindingly fast witcheries.  These cast magical effects -- beneficial and detrimental -- on the shaman themselves.  Shamans also use mojo to move their zimbies on the main board -- so, the more scrolls a shaman uses the less mojo they have available for movement. Combat is a simple 1d6 &quot;roll-off&quot; with the combatant making the higher die roll dealing a number of wounds damage equal to the difference in the die rolls to the combatant making the lower die roll.&#10;&#10;TIMING&#10;Many of a player's actions are limited to the player's turn, such as spawning new zimbies, turning zimbies into zombies, movement and combat.  Players may extract and use mojo at any time on any player's turn.  So, scroll use is always an option!&#10;&#10;FIRST MOVER STRATEGY&#10;At the end of the round, after all the players have gone, the player with the most undepleted zimbies on his tribal board becomes the first mover on the next round.  That player goes first and play proceeds clockwise from them.&#10;&#10;SOLO&#10;There is also a solo mode, which is not only a fully realized game but also very useful to hone the strategies that you will use in your multiplayer games. But be warned: solo play is limited to 12 turns and your score gets lower the more turns you take.  It's not too hard to win, but it's tough to get a high score!&#10;&#10;HAVE FUN WREAKING HAVOC!&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with two randomly-drawn tiles in hand, with each double-sided tile depicting 1-3 types of landscape out of the four types present in the world.&#10;&#10;When play begins, each player simultaneously starts laying tiles into the frame; each tile must be adjacent to two sides to be placed, so initially tiles can be placed only in the corners of the frames, with players building inward from there. Players can place tiles anywhere that they can legally be placed (two sides are adjacent to the frame or previously placed tiles and all landscapes match across tile borders.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile, a player can place it in their personal discard area, which can hold at most ten tiles. When a player has both hands free, they can draw two new tiles from the bag; alternatively, any player with a free hand can pick up any tile in any discard area and place it in the world.&#10;&#10;At any point during the game, a player can claim one of four gods and that god's followers. Each god is associated with a particular type of landscape, e.g., the merfolk god. Once a player has followers, they can place a prophet on a tile they just placed to claim that section of landscape. Players can place any number of prophets in a landscape as long as they're placing each prophet on a tile they just added to the world.&#10;&#10;At any point in the game, if a player thinks that a section of the board cannot be filled with a tile &mdash; e.g., a space that's surrounded by four types of landscapes &mdash; that player can place a round city marker in that space, and then claim that city with a prophet. If a matching tile is found later, a player can &quot;smash&quot; and collect that city, replacing it with the tile.&#10;&#10;Once the world is filled or players agree that no more tiles can be placed, the game ends. Each player scores five points for each city occupied or smashed. Each landscape with one or more prophets is worth a number of points to the player(s) with the most prophets in it equal to the number of tiles in that landscape minus the number of prophets in it. The landscape with the largest mass rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest masses rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses; similarly, the landscape that appears in the most distinct groups rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest groups again rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses.&#10;&#10;Whichever god has scored the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately you can't just grab them for yourself as everyone in the neighborhood wants to claim those adorable kitties. Outwit your fellow feline fiends as you lure cats onto your property, move cats into your house, and steal cats from your neighbors. All's fair in love and cat-collecting!&#10;&#10;In the game, each player chooses a Property board, which contains three zones: the Yard, the Porch, and the House. At the end of the game, cats in the House are worth 5 points each, cats on the Porch are worth 3 points each, and cats in your Yard are worth 0 points. However, having cats in your Yard does have advantages for special scoring conditions, such as having the most cats of a single color or the most cats overall. All 40 cat miniatures are placed in the center of the table, and represent the Neighborhood. Each player is dealt 2 or 3 cards, depending on the number of players in the game.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn, they perform two Actions: moving a cat, playing a card, or discarding cards. Cats can be moved 1 space for 1 Action, by picking up the cat and putting it in the next zone of the property. For example, a cat can be moved from the Neighborhood to the Yard for 1 Action, or from the Yard to the Porch or from the Porch to the Yard (and vice versa). Playing cards may allow a player to move multiple cats at once, to move cats multiple spaces, to steal cats from opponents, or to make opponents give up cats. A player may also choose to discard 1, 2, or 3 cards as an Action. Once both Actions have been taken, the player draws back up to a full hand, and play passes to the person to the left. If an Instant card (red border) is drawn, it is played immediately and affects the entire group. The player then draws a replacement card for the Instant card until a full hand is achieved.&#10;&#10;The final round is triggered when a player draws the last card from the draw pile. From that point every player, including the player who drew the last card, has one final turn to maximize their score. Then, the cats are counted and a winner is lauded for their purr-procurement proficiency.&#10;&#10;",

Shove too many in one cage, and they'll be worth almost nothing to you.&#10;&#10;In each round, someone deals a line of twelve cards face up on the table; each card depicts an animal (a curio in the original version) along with a point value and a limit. The starting player splits the line in two by choosing a dividing point. Each player holds two cards showing the left or right group, and each player chooses, then simultaneously reveals which group of cards they want. If only one player chooses a side, they take all the cards in that group and add them to their personal tableau. If a side is chosen by more than one player, however, then one of the players who chose it splits that group into two smaller groups, then everyone who originally chose this group secretly votes again for which group they want. This process repeats with each group until either each player has taken some number of cards or groups have been reduced to single cards and two or more players are still voting to take them; in this case, those single cards are placed in a special pile. At the start of a round, the starting player adds a special card to the line-up and whoever wins this card collects all of the animals in this special pile.&#10;&#10;Players complete three rounds this way, then score points. If a group of cards has exceeded the limit on it &mdash; say, by collecting four cards when the limit is three &mdash; then the owner of these cards scores only 1 point per card instead of the point value for each card. Some cards in the game allow you to remove cards from your collection, possibly allowing you to stay under the limit and score more points. You might also start trying not to win cards so as not to spoil the value of what you've already collected. (In Curio Collectors, you would effectively crash the market value for an item by trying to sell too many of them at one time.)&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;",

They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.&#10;&#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&#10;&#10;The Deluxe edition contains the basic Taluva game at increased size, as well as the following new expansions:&#10;&#10;     Ship expansion: A new wooden piece, which can be placed in lagoons, adjacent to settlements&#10;     2-Hex tiles expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The remaining scattered groups of survivors are fighting amongst themselves for dominance over the remnants of the past. Now it is your turn to join the global war and recruit soldiers, battle machines, powerful hybrids, or tremendous mutants into your army. Equip your troops with the best available technologies and show all your enemies who is the ruler of the new order.&#10;&#10;Players are represented in the game by their hero and play units or one-time effects (tactics) in an attempt to destroy all cards from the opponent&rsquo;s deck. The number of cards in the deck and the player&rsquo;s hand is connected to the number of health points of the player's hero. For each point of damage that the hero receives, the player has to destroy one of their cards &ndash; from the top of their deck or from their hand. Once a player loses all cards from their deck and hand they lose the game. Because each card used by a player during the game costs them a life point, players are forced to play cards as efficiently as possible so that each played card does more damage to the enemy than to themselves.&#10;&#10;These combined mechanics create a well-balanced system where every erroneous move or unplanned action can lead to a player&rsquo;s defeat. Each and every decision is tightly coupled, and even a small decision can completely change the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Players have to find a balance between investing in game control, which allows them to play cards more effectively, or investing in killing the enemy hero, which is the primary goal. This means that players should control their damage output wisely. One can easily feed the enemy graveyard with destroyed cards, which may turn the game completely against them - because of the recycling system which allows players to put cards from the graveyard back on the battlefield. So, instead of dealing massive amounts of damage directly to the enemy hero, waiting sometimes has its benefits.&#10;&#10;Timing of attacks, card activation, graveyard management and tactical decisions are the real keys to victory.&#10;&#10;",

The liberal team always has a majority.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is.&#10;&#10;Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.&#10;&#10;The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls a faction of revolutionaries who must cooperate with other factions while balancing their own objectives in order to push back riot cops, loot shopping centers, build barricades, and occupy state districts before the military arrives and time runs out.&#10;&#10;Bloc by Bloc is played in a city made up of 25 district tiles connected by streets, highways, and metro stations. Each player controls one of four factions in the city: the Workers, the Neighbors, the Students, or the Prisoners. Each district tile has a two sides: a repressed side and a liberated side. At the start of the game, all districts are repressed and, over the course of the game, players work together to liberate districts one at a time.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 8 rounds. Each round is 1 night and each night has 2 phases. During the Sunset phase, each player takes a turn: 3-5 actions and ending with police movement controlled by the Police Ops deck. Each player starts with 1 bloc in the city and can add more throughout the game. On a player's turn, they roll dice and take one action (such as looting, occupying, attacking, or barricading) for each die rolled with 1+ of their blocs. Players may use loot cards to enhance their actions. After all factions have taken their turns, the Sunrise phase begins, which is when police attack and factions have a chance to liberate districts.&#10;&#10;The police and the State are the common enemies of all factions. Occupations must be built in all State districts by any combination of factions for the insurrection to be successful. However, each faction also has its own secret agenda with a set of specific tasks that faction must complete in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "OVERVIEW&#10;Sans Alli&eacute;s (French: &ldquo;without allies&rdquo;) is a solitaire card game where you command 20th century troops and technology, pushing through an enemy nation bent on developing a vile super-weapon.  Sans Alli&eacute;s takes the feel of a grand-strategy, area-movement war game and compresses it into a tight little solo package, playable in about an hour.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;The enemy nation is represented by an assortment of &quot;region&quot; cards arranged as a layered pyramid, with the &quot;enemy capital&quot; card at the top of the pyramid.  Meanwhile, the enemy's &quot;progress&quot; towards completion of an ultimate weapon is represented by a proximity track along the side of the pyramid, which possibly increases each turn.  The object of the game is to capture or claim the enemy capital card before the enemy succeeds in completing his weapon.&#10;&#10;No region card can be removed from the pyramid until either one or both of the cards laid atop it are removed first.  Therefore, you will need to capture region cards at the lowest level of the pyramid first, working your way up the pyramid in stages.  Each attempt to capture a region is called an &quot;invasion.&quot; To conduct invasions, you gather various military unit cards from your draw deck (separate from the enemy nation deck).  These units have strength values, while each level of the pyramid has a defensive value.  You have to amass enough strength and the right types of units to attempt an invasion on a given region, and then a roll of the dice determines whether you lose (discard) this entire invasionary force, or save a few, or lose more than expected, and are possibly forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;Along the way, you can capture select region cards called resource centers, and/or you can invade select zones to liberate prison camps.  These achievements not only increase the number of cards you draw on a turn, but also grant you the ability to improve your units strength values, and they introduce tactical developments that give you more dynamic choices in battle, including an Ultimate Weapon of your own.&#10;&#10;",
