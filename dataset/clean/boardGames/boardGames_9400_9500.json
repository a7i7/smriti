As you sail your ship around a bottlecap, you will loot and plunder gold and wood to improve your city (granting you new abilities) and gain victory points. And while you may get hurt along the way, sometimes it's best to just push ahead, because the Valkyries don't come to claim the dead immediately...&#10;&#10;Bottlecap Vikings is a small rondel game with a ton of replayability. The rondel spaces are not fixed in place- they are randomized at the beginning of the game. Not only that, they're double-sided, so you might never play on the exact same configuration twice. There are two different victory conditions, and players each have a small &quot;tech-tree&quot; in their city with multiple viable paths. Furthermore, the city cards are double-sided, one side is identical for all players, and the other side is unique. To top it off, the crux of the gameplay is the push-your-luck damage system, which makes you value spaces differently depending on how damaged you or others already are.&#10;&#10;Bottlecap Vikings is packaged with 3 mini-expansions for other Tasty Minstrel Games&#10;Harbour: Ice Viking&#10;Gold West: Bandits Promo&#10;Eminent Domain: Battlecruisers &#226;&#128;&#147; Heavy Assault&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "The Others",
        "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality. Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).&#10;&#10;The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH&rsquo;s victory.&#10;&#10;Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences.&#10;&#10;The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission.&#10;&#10;The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing.&#10;&#10;There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique.&#10;&#10;The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it&rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!&#10;&#10;Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity.&#10;&#10;",

In 1547 Vicino Orsini wanted to celebrate the grandeur of his family, by commissioning one of the greatest architectural wonders of Italy. Within a natural amphitheater were masterfully carved huge mythological figures, whose sublime beauty enchants and terrifies those who are in their presence. Even today the park is shrouded in mystery: is it a Sacred Grove in which to bring votive offerings to the gods or a Park of Monsters made to scare poor people? It's rumored that Vicino Orsini owed his own fortune to the devotion shown to the gods and to the offers that he brought to them.&#10;&#10;In Bomarzo, you will have to delve into the mystery of the park, to propitiate the gods and obtain their favor. You&rsquo;ll play the role of one of the feudal lords of the Orsini and you&rsquo;ll manage one of four minor feuds, Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero or Mompeo, trying to earn the esteem of your lord. If you&rsquo;ll develop your feud in the best way you will manage to prevail over your rivals. Do not forget the supernatural forces that dwell in Bomarzo: your existence and your achievement will be influenced by how you manage to turn in your advantage the will of the monsters of the park.&#10;&#10;Bomarzo is a game of deep strategy for 2-4 players, the short duration of which gives to the players' choices even more decisive importance. The careful management of resources will allow you to easily take advantage of the power of the monstrous deity of the park. Each turn you will be able to perform various operations in your fief and also you will have to choose which god ingratiate, through workers placement bound by auction. But beware: each divinity of the park requires a very specific offer to concede his favor otherwise unleash his monstrous fury on unwary visitors! To triumph in Bomarzo you not only need the best development but mostly to have tied your for-tunes to the most powerful and prestigious deity.&#10;&#10;",

You share two random battlefields with each of the players next to you: one worth 4 points, the other 6.&#10;&#10;You get a hand of thirteen cards numbered from 0 to 3. They are your peasants, thugs, lords. On your turn, send two of them to one or two of your battlefields. When all the cards have been played, each battlefield is won by the player with the highest sum of card values there. &#239;&#191;&#188;Some cards are always played face up, others always face down. Some of them also have a special power: Use your peasants (0) to lure your opponent's troops to a battlefield, or to score more points if they survive. Play a Lord (2) early as it's strengthened by each new reinforcement thereafter.&#10;&#10;Terrains also impact a battle's outcome: Peasants take arms to protect their rice fields, while military strength is not always enough when you fight over a palace. &#239;&#191;&#188;&#239;&#191;&#188;&#239;&#191;&#188;&#239;&#191;&#188;&#239;&#191;&#188;&#239;&#191;&#188;Once each battlefield has been scored, the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player commands a master builder, who moves around a circular track on the game board, enabling you to buy or build only where this master builder is located. Moving the master builder to farther locations along the track is expensive, so players must plan their movements and builds carefully. The number and type of actions that may be performed on your turn comes from cards in your personal draw deck.&#10;&#10;Buildings are erected physically at the various locations around the city using 3D building pieces.&#10;&#10;",

If players succeed to defeat the monster, players can divide rewards but the player who played the lowest value will go first.&#10;&#10;Japanese summary:&#10;&#10;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#160;&#177;&#233;&#133;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#139;&#135;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#140;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#133;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#177;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#232;&#191;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#182;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#152;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#230;&#178;&#162;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#172;&#145;&#233;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#169;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#233;&#154;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#230;&#138;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#191;&#161;&#233;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#150;&#145;&#230;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.&#10;&#10;Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.&#10;&#10;With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.&#10;&#10;Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?&#10;&#10;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:&#10;&#10;     Villager Tool tokens&#10;     Lost Villagers&#10;     Swamp Villagers&#10;     Exclusive Stretch goals:&#10;     Creature Villagers&#10;     Quest Tokens&#10;     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book&#10;     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book &#10;     Wooden Goods&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition exclusives&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Pass with care...&#10;&#10;Many are the paths to power: brute force, subtle deception, cunning trickery. You hold the cards...but you can't keep them all. What will you decide to collect for personal gain? And what are you willing to give up in order to destroy? The Ravens are gathering, many of whom used to be rivals. Will you rise to power or simply be...nevermore.&#10;&#10;Nevermore is a casual-style, card-drafting game in which you quickly build your hand each round, collecting cards you want and poisoning your opponent's hand by passing along cards you think they can't use. Whoever holds the most of a given suit, gains the power of that suit to attack, heal, acquire Light or Shadow magicks and score victory points.&#10;&#10;Will you transform all your rivals into ravens &mdash; or can they regain their human form in time to score enough victory to win?&#10;&#10;&#10;Nevermore can be taught in less than five minutes, yet hides a surprising amount of depth in strategy, as players try to outwit and outmaneuver their opponents. Player &lsquo;transformation&rsquo; replaces player elimination, keeping everyone in the game until the last moment, yet still rewards players who have performed better during the game. That's because a player who has become a Raven cannot win until they can find a way to transform back, but they still play, helping to doom other players and trying to collect one of two specific hands (all of one suit - or - one of every suit) to become human again.&#10;&#10;Short game length encourages multiple plays per session and appeals to players of all skill levels &ndash; with plenty of underhanded plotting and backstabby goodness.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play Overview:&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of 5 cards - but they will not keep them all.&#10;During the drafting phase, players must pass three of those cards to the player on their left. From their new set of five, they must then pass two to the left. Lastly, they will pass one card left - ending the drafting phase with a final drafted hand of five cards. They will have attempted to collect cards from a certain suit (or two) trying to be the player who has the most of that suit this hand - and also carefully managing what they are passing to their opponent, to make sure they don't end up with too powerful a hand.&#10;&#10;During the resolution phase, each suit is called for, one at a time. All players show cards from that suit simultaneously. The player with the most gains the power of the suit - and the strength of the ability is determined by subtracting the second highest total of that suit. Example: I hold three Attack cards. Two other players each hold one Attack card. (3-1=2) I do a 2 point attack on a player I choose. Healing, Victory points and Radiance (which draws a Light Magick card for each you have minus the second highest amount) all work the same way. All but Ravens, who kill cards of other suits in your hand. Example: I have 3 Victory, 1 Attack and 1 Raven. I must choose to sacrifice either 1 Attack or 1 Victory card from my hand as they are Resolved. Certain special hands give additional benefits and/or Victory points.&#10;&#10;If your 5 Health points drop to 0, you become a Raven, still in the game, but unable to win until you can transform back.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the last human player standing - or the first to score 6 Victory points.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect to play is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck.

        "description": "In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.&#10;&#10;What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Your old favorite book is now your new favorite game! In Bring Your Own Book, players take turns drawing prompts from the deck, then race to find the best phrase in their own book that satisfies the prompt. What's the tastiest &ldquo;name for a candy bar&rdquo; in that history textbook you're reading for school? How quickly can you find &ldquo;lyrics from a country western song&rdquo; in your dog-training guide? What kind of &ldquo;advice for graduating seniors&rdquo; will appear in your anthology of limericks?&#10;&#10;In more detail, everyone has their own book and sits in a circle. The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud. Everyone except the Picker searches their book for text to match the prompt, sequential text of any length: a single word, half of a sentence, a whole sentence, multiple sentences, etc.&#10;&#10;The first Seeker to find matching text announces &quot;I've got it&quot; and starts the timer. When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &quot;I've got it&quot;), each Seeker reads what they've found. Seekers who didn't find text in time open to a random page and read a random sentence from it. The Picker chooses their favorite submission and awards the card to that Reader. After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left. This happens any time a player reaches three cards during the game. Thus, it can happen as many times as there are players.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one player has collected the required number of cards and wins: with 5-7 players the first to 4 cards win; with 3-4 players the first to 5 cards win.&#10;&#10;",

You and your increasingly mighty party of adventuring companions have spent all day slogging through the dungeon, killing monsters and taking their stuff. Now you&rsquo;re back in town, healed up, cleaned up, and ready to party at the Red Dragon Inn. Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don&rsquo;t forget to keep an eye on your gold. If you run out, you&rsquo;ll have to spend the night in the stables. Oh&hellip; and try not to get too beaten up or too drunk. If you black out, your friends will continue the party without you&hellip; after they loot your body for gold, of course! The last conscious adventurer with gold wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Red Dragon Inn 5: The Character Trove is a standalone game for 2-4 players. It expands on &quot;The Red Dragon Inn&quot; family of box sets and single-character expansions called Allies. You can mix and match characters from any of these sets, letting you build the party composition of your choice! Each of the box sets includes four unique characters, a drink deck, gold pieces, and all the parts for 2-4 players to play right out of the box. Each of the Allies expansions includes a character deck as well as gold pieces and bits so you can add another character to a box set (thus making a 2-4 player collection playable by 2-5 players).&#10;&#10;Sera the Fleetfooted: Sera is a stealthy rogue whose speed and agility allow her to take down roomfuls of bad guys before they even know what&rsquo;s happening.

Even while she&rsquo;s partying, she continues training to make sure she&rsquo;s always at the top of her game.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: She hones her skills by sparring with her friends.&#10;    The Bad: Sometimes she does this without warning them first&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;Lizwick the Collector: Lizwick is a consummate problem solver with an unrivaled collection of gear. Her wondrous Bag of Holding contains rare and peculiar items of all descriptions. She is always on the lookout for the next amazing whatchamacallit to add to her collection. Lizwick has gotten The Party out of many a jam with the clever application of the wrong tool at the right time.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: Lizwick&rsquo;s collection is the envy of academies, guilds and hoarders alike!&#10;    The Bad: &hellip;and they&rsquo;d like their stuff back.&#10;&#10;&#10;Joran the Trickster: Joran&rsquo;s penchant for pranks earned him a student &ldquo;sabbatical&rdquo; from the Mage&rsquo;s Collegium. Fortunately, Zot saw some potential in the boy, and decided to take him adventuring for some valuable field experience. The young mage&rsquo;s humor has proven to be mostly harmless to his new friends. He puts his clever brain to good use by pulling fast ones on the bad guys.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: Joran&rsquo;s talent for misdirection makes him the perfect weapon against enemy spell-casters.&#10;    The Bad: It also makes him the perfect weapon against his friends&rsquo; gold, their sobriety, their patience&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;Zakhan the Drunken Master: Zakhan&rsquo;s father is a solemn elven noble and a guru of meditative martial combat techniques. His mother was a rowdy barbarian warchief with a penchant for throwing wild parties. This unique heritage has allowed Zakhan to hone a seemingly reckless hybrid fighting style of his own. His opponents who underestimate his &ldquo;drunken&rdquo; martial arts do so at their own peril!&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: Zakhan&rsquo;s drunken fighting techniques make him a formidable foe.&#10;    The Bad: Sometimes he&rsquo;s actually just drunk.&#10;&#10;&#10;But wait, there's more!

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Treasures of all types &mdash; yet the hard part is not capturing the ship's bounty, but dividing it fairly among the pirates! Players take turns splitting each round's booty into shares for the other players. Different types of treasures have different values, and of course there's the hidden items to keep people guessing. Will you be the quartermaster to give everyone their fair share &ndash; but giving yourself the best share?&#10;&#10;Each round in Booty, cards representing treasures are revealed. Some are worth points immediately, some items cancel others, some give you a chance (but not a guarantee) for a big payday. The quartermaster, a job that travels from player to player, divides the treasures into shares and also includes the order of picking treasures in the next round. Balancing what you need, what others might want, and trying to get a little extra into your treasure pile is the key to success!&#10;&#10;The building cards provide many special benefits that allow for a broad range of strategies every time you play.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You know there is money in chocolate, but it doesn't just grow on trees. You need to control the links in the production chain to get your cut of the cash, to make sure the cocao flows through your businesses instead of your competitors'.&#10;&#10;Sometimes you need to help your customers and suppliers to help yourself. If you are wily, you can figure out a way for your competitors to do the work for you. Create monopolies, cut off the supply chain, disrupt other players' finely honed plans &mdash; do whatever it takes to become King Chocolate.&#10;&#10;The fruit of the cacao tree goes through six steps to become chocolate. You can control only a few of these steps, so you  must work with your fellow chocolate makers to keep the chocolate flowing through the production chain. It sounds cooperative and friendly &mdash; but did we mention that the chocolate maker with the most money wins? Things always get complicated when money is involved.&#10;&#10;To ensure your portion of the production process is used the most so that it earns you cash, occasionally you'll help your customers and suppliers. At the same time, you will attempt to crush your competitors, force others to help you, and manipulate the supply chain.&#10;&#10;You'll do whatever it takes to become the king of chocolate.&#10;&#10;",

Using only your unique Luminary powers, the cards in your hand and cunning strategy, you will battle up to 3 opponents to accumulate the wealth and power necessary to dominate each era of the game.&#10;&#10;But be careful... because when you least expect it, something may occur that completely upsets the balance of power and may destroy even the most carefully laid plans!&#10;&#10;The base game contains 6 playable Luminaries - William Shakespeare, Martin Luther, Fillipo Brunelleschi, St. Ignatius of Loyola, Christopher Columbus and Francis Bacon - all of which come with their own unique Luminary Mats, cards and portaits. Up to 6 more Luminaries will be available in Special Editions.&#10;&#10;Unique Event and Intrusion cards are randomly seeded into the game during set-up, so you never know exactly what you may encounter!&#10;&#10;Featuring beautiful art and history, Renaissance Wars explores the people and events that made the Renaissance one of most interesting, creative and important historical eras.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Cauldron",
        "description": "Cauldron is a competitive board game set in a fantasy world. Taking on roles of powerful mystical characters like the Druid, the Shaman or the Wizard, players will brew potions to grow their magical power, while casting spells to stop others from getting ahead. Cauldron is a resource management game that plays with 2-5 players aged 10+ in 1 hour.&#10;&#10;Play revolves around a central set of fields, producing potion ingredients each season (frog legs, spider webs, dragon eggs etc). Each player has potions - way to combine ingredients to score Magik (game's victory points and currency). Players take turns harvesting ingredients, brewing potions and attempting to steal ingredients from competitors. Each player also has a hand of spells - one-time effects that help the player or hinder opponents. Each character has variable powers that modifies the way basic actions are resolved.&#10;&#10;After all ingredients have been harvested, players have a chance to invest some of their Magik to buy additional potions, spells or add fields to the game board. Balancing investment with advancement is a crucial part of the game.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one of the player reaches 35 Magik - that player is the winner. The game has an element of luck and conflict present but the majority of it revolves around resource management, planning and balancing short and long term investment.&#10;&#10;",
