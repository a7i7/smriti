        "description": "&quot;June 3. Cold Harbor. I was killed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Thus read the last diary entry, found in the pocket of a dead Union soldier. He had made the entry himself, while all around him, other soldiers were writing names and home addresses on slips of paper and pinning them to the back of their coats.&#10;&#10;These veteran soldiers knew what was coming, although it seems their commanders did not. Three full corps launched a disjointed attack against well-entrenched Confederates. In just eight minutes, the attack had petered out. Over 7000 Federals covered the Virginia soil. A few minutes later, the orders came down to renew the attacks, but at each level, from corps commander to captain, the orders were &quot;followed&quot; only by increased firing -- most of it blindly -- while remaining in position.&#10;&#10;Grant said, &quot;I regret this assault more than any one I ever ordered.&quot; Today it sounds more like WWI madness than part of Grant's successful campaign to end the Civil War.&#10;&#10;But it was not so easy on the other side. While one CSA staffer called it &quot;perhaps the easiest victory ever granted to Confederate arms by the folly of Federal commanders,&quot; from Lee's point of view, anything could happen. His army had &quot;not a regiment&quot; in reserve, and the volume of sound -- &quot;It seemed more like a volcanic blast than a battle,&quot; -- rattled windows all the way back in Richmond.&#10;&#10;Not War But Murder covers the week-long operation which marked the end of Grant's 30 day, &quot;smash 'em up&quot; campaign begun at Wilderness. Like a bloody chess match, Grant and Lee made move and counter move to get to this point, with Lee well aware that a false move could end the war quickly.&#10;&#10;Not War But Murder, by designer Michael Rinella, is his newest area-map game, and his first take on an American Civil War battle. This game includes one 22&quot; by 34&quot; inch area map, 176 5/8&quot; counters, and 16 pages of rules and charts that include extensive examples of play, designer notes, and variant rules. It also marks the debut of what Rinella calls the &quot;diceless advantage&quot;. In previous area-impulse games, from Monty's Gamble all the way to the Avalon Hill games of the early 1990s, an &quot;advantage chit&quot; allowed the person holding it to re-roll an single die roll (or rolls if it was a combat). In NWBM this changes. The player may spend the advantage to gain specific game benefits, automatically. Thus, rather than being hoarded, this &quot;twist of fate&quot; is likely to hop back and forth, as each player strives to save a desperate situation.&#10;&#10;What is most amazing about NWBM is how much of a &quot;game&quot; it actually is, offering both players challenges and fateful decisions to make, in this classic face-off of well-known leadership. What will you do?&#10;&#10;",

This series presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play combined with solid historical insight. Glory III follows the success of Glory II: Across the Rappahannock, and presents a polished system with ease of play, with two combat-intensive one-map battles. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.&#10;&#10;Glory III features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Both battles have special command problems and some new and interesting mechanics to allow the players to play within the framework of those conditions.&#10;&#10;Antietam, one of the major battles of the war, makes great use of the Glory activation system, linking the Union/McClellan command problems directly to its use. But it still allows the player to make choices, choices different from those Little Mac made, perhaps changing the course of the battle.&#10;&#10;Cedar Creek is a great momentum battle, with an initial, probably highly effective Confederate surprise attack followed by the return of General Phil Sheridan to the battlefield, the arrival of George Custer's repeater-armed cavalry, and, hopefully for the Union Player, enough of a counter-attack to snatch victory from Jubal Early's rapidly munching jaws. Has Jubal bitten off more than he can chew? Grab your wallet, roll the die and find out!&#10;&#10;Designed gloriously by Richard H Berg, Developed with consummate skill and dedication by a new star on the industry horizon, Jim Dauphinais, playtested to a fine edge, and featuring the usual eye-popping, drool-inducing GMT graphics, Glory III is the best game yet in the Glory series.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 22 x 34 backprinted map&#10;     2 counter sheets&#10;     Rulebook&#10;     1 die&#10;     Player Aid Cards &#10;&#10;&#10;Designer: Richard Berg&#10;Developer: Jim Dauphinais&#10;&#10;Game 3 in the GMT Glory Civil War game series. This series features battles recreated at the Brigade level with each game in the series featuring 2 battles from the Civil War. In this edition of the series the two battles are Antietam and Cedar Creek.&#10;&#10;The Glory system features a unique chit activation mechanic. This results in players unsure of when or if a certain field commander will carry out your orders. The game system is designed for playability over bookkeeping. The main rules are only 12 pages long.  Scenarios run from 2 hours for Burnside's late afternoon attack at Antietam, up to 6 hours for Cedar Creek and up to 12 hours for the full battle of Antietam (if it needs to go the distance for a decision).&#10;&#10;",

The long-standing feud between the Bourbons and Habsburgs erupted once again as both sides pressed their claim to the throne. No Peace Without Spain is a two-player game that elegantly recreates this epic struggle using a point-to-point map and a single deck of 55 cards. Action cards are used to activate armies for movement and siege, while event cards bring historical and special events into play that can swing the tide of fortune when least expected. Each turn represents one year, each corps represents 10,000 men of all arms and each leader represents a major commander and his staff.&#10;&#10;The game features an easy and intuitive battle system that highlights a unique aspect of this war: team-based battle command, perhaps the most famous example being the extraordinary success achieved by the partnership of two of the war&rsquo;s most prominent commanders, the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Bourbon cause has talented leaders as well, notably Marshals Villars, Vendome and Berwick. These and other leaders are rated for Tactical and Command capabilities and they significantly influence the course of events.&#10;&#10;The map stresses the importance of fortresses in a war that was probably the high-point of formal siege warfare. Fortresses in this era rarely held out against a besieger that had the necessary time and manpower to conduct a proper siege, and the game neatly recreates this with a simple siege table that leaves room for unusually stout defenses or quick collapses.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained or lost by the Alliance player and game victory comes either through automatic victory or based on final VPs after the 1713 turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;No Peace Without Spain is a two player game depicting the War of the Spanish Succession. The war was fought primarily to determine the fate of the Spanish throne and its dominions but also represented a continuing struggle for political, religious and economic dominance.

Will they succeed or are the strict guards too clever for them? &#10;&#10;Strategic escaping game&#10;SECTION X is a game in which clever escapees dig tunnels themselves but also make use of tunnels belonging to other players and cut each other off. Special hiding places ensure that the prisoners are safe when the ruthless prison guards make their rounds. A rumor has spread that an escape is imminent, so it becomes more and more difficult to remain out of the hands of the guards. Doors lock the entrances to the different escape tunnels. Are you able to control the underground network of tunnels and lead the prisoners from your cell block to freedom first? But watch out! The prisoners risk their lives if the escape is discovered!&#10;&#10;Additional information&#10;Age: 10 and up &#10;Graphics: Yvon-Cheryl Scholten&#10;Illustrations cover: Bernhard Kilchmann&#10;Release Date: September 16th 2006&#10;&#10;",

LNA uses cards to represent the military units, supply convoys and objectives of the historic campaign. To win, you must consider your units' combat power and maneuver options as well as their supply situation. The game features: the Afrika Korps, Tobruk, the Desert Rats, Malta, anti-tank guns, resupply from Europe, minefields and more. LNA is based around a new combat system that makes maneuver and planning as important as brute force. That approach is faithful to the historic events, in which smaller forces were often able to defeat and rout larger ones by using better tactics and planning. In LNA, battles can be won not only by overwhelming the enemy with firepower, but also by out-thinking and bluffing him.

Erickson and T.F. Erickson, Jr. began&#10;boardgame development. In an era when both the railroad and board gaming industry was in flux, the Ericksons managed to combine elements from the two to create a game that has withstood the test of time. In fact, it provided solid footing for the whole &quot;train gaming&quot; genre.&#10;&#10;The Ericksons decided to publish the game on their own, and released it as &quot;BOXCARS&quot; in 1974. It was billed as &quot;The Informative NEW travel game of OLD-time railroading.&quot; For a first-time effort, the components of the resulting boardgame were surprisingly refined and professional.&#10;&#10;The single-piece board unfolded to reveal a map of the United States on which routes of 28 historic railroads were traced. The rules of BOXCARS vary from those of Rail Baron in several ways. For example, BOXCARS has no restriction in the re-use of routes: this allows players to circle along the same track as long as desired. BOXCARS also allows a player to trade, sell or auction a RR at any time during the game. Furthermore, BOXCARS lacks the Express and Superchief locomotive upgrades that Rail Baron contains.&#10;&#10;Before long, the Ericksons' game caught the attention of The Avalon Hill Game Company (AH). The original designers apparently sold the BOXCARS rights to AH and were obligated to quickly disperse the remaining copies of their game. It is estimated that there were only 1000 copies of BOXCARS ever printed.&#10;&#10;AH scaled down the game's physical size to match the &quot;bookshelf&quot; style of many of its other titles, modified the rules, and released it as Rail Baron in 1977.&#10;&#10;(Description adapted with permission from &quot;An Illustrated History of Rail Baron&quot;)&#10;&#10;",

In Laser Battle, the laser must be bounced at the proper angle off pieces which can be rotated to 16 different angles (22&frac12;&deg; increments: 0&deg;, 22&frac12;&deg;, 45&deg;, and so forth), which reflects the laser orthogonally and/or diagonally, at the players' discretion (or error!).&#10;     In Khet, the laser is fired from the walls of the game board.  In Laser Battle, the laser is being fired by a unit, which you may rotate for very surprising victory.&#10;     In Khet, each player must fire the laser after her move.  In Laser Battle, firing the laser is optional, allowing both sloppier play and stealthier play.&#10;     Khet has a fixed game board (and a moveable / roteable mirrored second-floor with the Khet 3D: Tower of Kadesh expansion).

Naturally, only the biggest and strongest Empires are up to this task and so a certain amount of dominance needs to be proved. Alternatively, you can play as the terrorists, fighting for a world without empires.&#10;&#10;Everyone starts the game as an Empire, with a couple of free villages and they can settle anywhere in the world. Although peaceful (we had to ban fighting in the first round) the 'politics' of the game already start to form, depending on what oil is discovered and how 'aggressive' the initial settlement choice is.&#10;&#10;Empires then spread over the planet grabbing all available land, searching for the best oil and the most strategic borders. Some go for towns and cities, other spend their cash on extra empire cards, building up their political options. Maybe, if they're lucky, they'll get an early nuke.&#10;&#10;Sooner or later someone takes a pop. Maybe the Axis of Evil has declared an Empire evil, giving them a few terrorist cards which are just too tempting not to play. Maybe someone is looking too strong already. Maybe you've got a grudge from a previous game or maybe you just want to win. Either way, war is declared or the terrorists strike!&#10;&#10;Although it is possible to win the game with all the players still playing as Empires, the more likely outcome is that Empires are destroyed, bankrupted, or simply cave in and become terrorist players. As more empires fall they work together as a single terrorist player. With each new influx of terrorist cards and cash for the terrorist cause, the remaining Empires begin to wish that maybe they shouldn't have funded quite so much terrorism as they did.&#10;&#10;",

They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.&#10;&#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&#10;&#10;",

In the basic version, designed for younger players, characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized or eliminated. The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.&#10;&#10;Each unit has a movement rating in hexes. Combat is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card. Extra hits count as wounds (figures may have more than one wound).&#10;&#10;The master game uses a system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;",

Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.&#10;&#10;Conflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames. The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units.

        "description": "In Traders of Carthage, players are merchants who are attempting to ship four different types of goods from Alexandria to Carthage. Players affect how quickly or slowly the ships move and can trigger pirate raids that may cost their opponents their goods. (Traders of Osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era, with players now trying to deliver cargo from Osaka to Edo, but otherwise gameplay remains the same.)&#10;&#10;The game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow, marking safe ports and dangerous waters. The board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the Market and Farm cards are laid out. The game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses, 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold, four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed, four trader pieces to indicate a player's scoring pile, four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game is a set collection game at its core. Player are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players, to represent gold to purchase good when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates. Deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they can do one of three things: Buy Goods, Get Coins or Reserve a Card.&#10;&#10;Buying goods has the player buying cards from the Market. There will be a number of cards laid out, face up, in the Market. Each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth (either 2, 3 or 5). When a player buys goods, they must buy all the cards in the Market, using cards in hand to pay. If a player cannot afford the whole Market, they cannot do this action. Any cards purchased this way are laid out, face up, in front of the player. These goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color. Then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards Carthage (1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased, 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased). If a ship moves onto Carthage, a payout occurs and pirates attack (this will be explained in detail later). If the Market is bought out or if the current player can't take or buy market cards (due to reservation pieces), the cards in the Farm (3 face up cards) are moved to the market. 2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the Market. Then 3 new cards are drawn for the Farm and are placed face up.&#10;&#10;Getting coins has the player taking a single card from the Market and placing it in his hand. That card is now money, its value indicated by the gold value in the corners. This is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have.&#10;&#10;Reserving a card has the player placing their Reservation piece on a card in the Market or in the Farm. This card is now unavailable to all other players. The Reservation piece is now committed to that card and can't be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good. The owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it, assuming there is another legal play he can do.&#10;&#10;After taking his turn, the next player takes his action, and so on until the game ends.&#10;&#10;If a payout occurs, each player that has good on that ship takes part. First the players count how many of that colored good they have. Then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value. They take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set, rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10. For example, if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3, they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9, then round up to 10. The player then takes that value and divides by 5. The result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps. Keeping with the example, the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2. This means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set. Players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit. These cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile, indicating this is their scoring pile. At the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point. This procedure is completed for each ship that reached Carthage. Then those ships are moved back to Alexandria, ready for another voyage. Each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored (not each card they scored).&#10;&#10;When during a payout, any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods  will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set. They then figure out how many cards they keep. For example, if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5. The player also has two blue tokens. The player would add 2 (for his tokens) to 5 for a value of 7. Then he would multiply 7 by 3, getting 21 and round up to 25. After dividing 25 by 5, the player can keep 5 cards. If a player gets to keep more cards than in the set, as in this example, they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference. These drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile.&#10;&#10;After the payout, any ships that are in the two Pirate spaces are attacked. Affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships. Each card has either 2, 1 or no urns on them. When you discard a card with 2 urns, two goods of that color are protected from the pirates. For example, if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns, then he may choose which two cards are protected. After all players have finished discarding cards (which is voluntary; players are not required to protect their goods), the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards Carthage.&#10;&#10;The game ends once a player has 8 or more Achievement tokens. The winner is the player with the highest score (number of cards in their score pile). If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the number of Achievement tokens the tied players have. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In 982, a Viking jarl called Erik the Red sailed from the western coast of Iceland and discovered a new land. He named it Graenaland, a green land. Four years later the first colonists arrived to Greanaland and founded settlements that lasted more than four centuries.&#10;&#10;Take the role of one of the jarls leading their clans to the new home. You have to settle the coast and to agree with your neighbors on how to distribute the spare resources the land is giving away. As Eric wants no fights amongst Vikings, any conflicts are solving by voting. You could improve your position in order to gain more votes; however, you can also try to be righteous and to keep good relations with all your neighbors. Cooperating with them, you can fertilize and improve the land easier than when struggling for influence; just keep your position strong enough for the case something goes wrong.&#10;&#10;At first glance, it might remind you just another settler-like game &ndash; there are tiles of different terrains, there are villages and other buildings built on the tiles, and there are resources produced to build more of them. However, Graenaland uses these elements by very unusual way, and offers brand new player interaction.&#10;&#10;The main difference is that villages produce no resources; the tile produces them. They remain placed next to the tile, until players agree how to distribute them. Every village on the tile gives one vote to its owner, as well as the traveling heroes just visiting the tile &ndash; and you need more than half of the votes total for your proposal how to distribute the resources.&#10;&#10;A tile produces only one resource per turn, no matter how many villages of how many players is built on it. Building more villages on the same tile strengthens your position here; however, if another player does the same, you both are spending lots of efforts and resources struggling for still the one resource card. May be it would be wise to live in peace instead. If you are able to come to an agreement, you can take turns taking the resource. You can vote together in the case an intruder appears. You can build some improvements on the tile together, increasing its resource production. You can spread your villages to other tiles and let your hero travel where it is more needed, rather than struggling for influence on this tile.&#10;&#10;If you trust each other, you can work much more efficiently. However: does your neighbor deserve your trust? What if he returns with his hero unexpectedly, and confiscates the whole harvest of several turns? What if he builds another village here instead of the improvement he promised? And especially &ndash; what would you do if you get such an opportunity yourself? &#10;The game mechanics &ndash; simultaneous movement of heroes, small anomalies in player roles (one player has special role every turn), and decent randomness and uncertainty in resource harvesting (each terrain produces resources of more types, with different probabilities) lead to enough interesting asymmetric situations, and it is up to you whether you take any advantage you have, or whether you try to appear fair and righteous to the others instead. As the others take it in to account when searching for partners for their deals.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Hilarious pop culture fun gets a Cranium spin! From Madonna and mullets to moonwalks and Monday Night Football, this party game isn't about what you know, but how you show it.&#10;&#10;Here's how it works: Each turn, the opposing team draws a clue card and assigns points to each of the five activity choices, according to how hard they think each one will be. If they pull the &quot;Red Bull&quot; card, they may think drawing it is easy, so they'd give it one point. But acting? Hard. Five points! Now it's up to you to decide: Will you go for the easy points and draw, or go for the big points (and glory) by acting it out?&#10;&#10;Each turn you get to choose to act, draw, hum, sculpt, or use letter cubes to get your team to guess the clue. With songs, celebrities, fads, fashions, TV shows, movies, and more, Pop 5 cards include all kinds of fun pop culture clues that span the decades -- and every turn, you get to choose how to get your team to guess!&#10;&#10;* Would you act out Iron Chef or draw it?&#10;    * Would you rather hum a Spice Girls song or roll the letter cubes to give clues that start with the letters that come up?&#10;    * Would you choose to sculpt a Chia Pet out of clay or hum the jingle?&#10;&#10;",
