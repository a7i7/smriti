During the game, you discover the color of the mice and attempt to get your mice into your nest.  The endgame has a trading aspect where you trade a mouse of a color that is not the home nest's color to the proper owner who in turn may wind up having to trade as well.  Cats and chairs serve as devices to thwart your opponent's movement.  Cheese covers can be used to protect your mice.  The game is well themed with excellent bits.&#10;&#10;",

This game is based upon the typical life of a late medieval English court. Many Kings came under the influence of a select inner group of courtiers who used their influence to gain gifts of land, titles, money etc.&#10;&#10;This game recreates the desperate race to get the best and the most gifts for yourself. The game is played over three rounds; each round the King visits a royal castle or house (The Kings Progress). Your aim is to gain the most prestige for your family by collecting courtier cards, melding them to build your influence and thus gain control of the courtiers, advancing those courtiers to the royal castle and then using the courtiers to select various gifts for yourself. Gifts and courtier control gain victory points at the end of each round. As the game progresses gifts become more valuable. Each courtier also has a character ability which can be used by the player in control to gain extra actions or other advantages.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has an identical set of pieces in a unique color. The goal is to get rid of all of your pieces by placing them on the hexagonal game board. Each piece that you place after the first cannot touch previously-placed pieces of the same color; instead each piece must be a distance of &quot;1&quot; from another piece of the same color, where 1 is the length of a side of one of the small hexagons. Another restriction is that the distance being measured can't directly cross another player's piece, but it can lie at the junction of two pieces. Once all players have placed as many pieces as they can, they count the number of hexagonal units in the pieces they couldn't place, and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Gemblo supports up to six players. In the two-player version of the game, each player uses two colors of pieces.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This is a collectible trading card game published by Upper Deck in 2006 (Cryptozoic Entertainment took over the license and game in 2010) based on the massively multi-player online roleplaying game &quot;World of Warcraft.&quot;&#10;&#10;The World of Warcraft Trading Card Game draws from the rich lore of the Warcraft universe. Two factions are battling for supremacy over Azeroth&mdash;the Horde and the Alliance&mdash;and each time you play, you choose a hero from one of these factions to represent you. Your hero is the leader of your party who fights alongside your allies. The cards that you play will allow you to equip your hero with weapons and armor, use spells and talents, invite allies into your party, and complete quests. With each successive TCG set, the theme and cards echo the current max-level content from the online game.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to defeat your opponents before they defeat you. Over the course of the game, your hero and allies will deal damage to your opponents&rsquo; heroes and allies, and that damage is permanent unless it is healed. If your hero takes damage equal to or greater than his or her health, you&rsquo;re out of the game.&#10;&#10;Sets released&#10;&#10;Heroes of Azeroth (released October 2006) &#10;Through the Dark Portal (released April 2007) &#10;Fires of Outland (released August 2007) &#10;March of The Legion (released December 2007) &#10;Servants of the Betrayer (released April 2008) &#10;The Hunt for Illidan (released July 2008) &#10;Drums of War (released November 2008) &#10;Blood of Gladiators (released March 2009) &#10;Fields of Honor (released June 2009) &#10;Scourgewar (released November 2009) &#10;Wrathgate (released May 2010) &#10;Class Starter deck (July 2010)&#10;Archives (released August 2010)&#10;Icecrown (released September 2010)&#10;Worldbreaker (released December 2010)&#10;War of the Elements (released April 2011)&#10;Twilight of the Dragons (released July 2011)&#10;Throne of the Tides (released October 2011)&#10;Crown of the Heavens (released February 2012)&#10;Tomb of the Forgotten (released June 2012)&#10;War of the Ancients (released October 2012)&#10;Betrayal of the Guardian (released February 2013)&#10;Reign of Fire (released July 2013)&#10; Raid Decks&#10;&#10;Onyxia's Lair (December 2006) - Featuring the black dragon Onyxia.

Those with a talent for this will learn how to ship a Fettnapf around and win the game.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 3 cards (valued 0 to 9) and an island card (10 to 30). In turn order, each player plays a card and draws a new one into his hand. The played-out cards get added (up to 30) or subtracted (down to 10) and announced out loud: 24-28-32-26-18-9-12. Whenever a player goes over the limit, the right-hand player gets an island card. When a player announces a number that another player has in hand as an island card, then he&rsquo;s put his foot in it and receives a Fettnapf card. The game ends when a player has collected 4 Fettnapf cards. The winner is the player with the fewest Fettnapf cards.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Cowabunga&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(second edition, TG552)&#10;&#10;Inspired by the Book of Kells and its mesmerizing patterns woven amongst the vellum pages, Project Kells evolved.  Standing atop the Hill of Tara and contemplating the conjoined ringforts of Forradh and Teach Chormac, the games of Sacred Hill and High Kings of Tara were born.  Steeped in the ancient legends of Ireland&rsquo;s Celtic heritage and royal past, these unique games of pure strategy are appreciated by young and old alike.&#10;&#10;Tailten Games won the Games Magazine award for BEST ABSTRACT GAME 2006; the  Spiele f&uuml;r Zwei - Spiele Akademie 2005 (Austria); Index 100 - Showcase 2005 in Ireland; and the award for 'Best Irish-Style Traditional Gift' 2005 in Ireland for Project Kells.&#10;&#10;According to the designer, Murray Heasman,&quot;The game takes five minutes to learn, yet a lifetime to master.&quot; The sheer beauty of this game alone makes it a gift to treasure--but the three separate games  each pose a daunting task for any strategic or abstract gamer.&#10;&#10;In all there are eight variants to stimulate the mind, so take it to your own level.  From a more simple Sacred Hill, a go-like game with its' elemental challenges, to an all-out-brain-burner in the form of Poisoned Chalice... Project Kells combines the best of beauty, gameplay, theme, and replay value.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll be amazed at the possibilities.  Once you&rsquo;ve learned the basics, be prepared to delve deeper, because you&rsquo;re likely to be already hooked on this game.  Scoring with knots (instead of kingdoms) will get you addicted.&#10;&#10;&#10;     This first game: Sacred Hill introduces the basic elements of play.  The aim of both games is the same -- to have the least number of kingdoms by the time the game is ended, a kingdom being a group of linked ring forts.  There are two phases to the game.  In manoeuvres (first phase) you are building a network of unconnected ring forts scattered around the board.  In Battle (second phase) you are adding ring forts next to your own, linking them together with bridge tiles, to form larger (and fewer) kingdoms.  This starts to magically create the Celtic knotwork.  Isolated ring forts that are besieged must be captured.  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.===&#10;     The second game:  High Kings of Tara introduces the kings.  Each player has three which do the work of building your ring forts. They move like the knight in chess and add many more twists and turns to the game, taking it to another dimension.  Kings can capture enemy ring forts and kings; they can also be immobilized.  Your own kings cannot work in tandem and they must always move to a vacant hill whenever possible.  Ties are possible, but the duality of scoring pursuits (ringforts versus captured kings) usually prevents this possibility.  This is especially true in tournament scoring...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Those who feel that they have mastered those variants are encouraged to try the real brain burner of the bunch.  Poisoned Chalice  Played at right angles to each other, each player tries to exert total control over each other from a position of inferiority. The end scoring is the same as in the Sacred Hill variant, but in this endeavor the limitations of placement create challenging strategic obstacles for both opponents.  It is possible to exert control over an opponent in such a way that at times they are limited to one possibility for tile placement.  However, there are twists that occur if a piece is captured (surrounded) on the board (like in 'go').  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.&#10;&#10;&#10;This is very probably the same game [system] as The High Kings of Tara.&#10;&#10;",

There were a total of two sets of cards released for the game. The first, Arena, was released in January, 2006. The second set, Secret Origins, was released in October, 2006. Since then, there have been no official releases.&#10;&#10;The COHCCG was designed to be a quick game. Rather than using a turn structure where each player takes multiple actions in a row, the game used an alternating action structure. This lead to faster and more interactive games. Each player was represented by a Hero card, which began play with 2 starting powers. As their action, a player had many choices, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play a card, being:&#10;         a Sidekick&#10;         a Power that can be used by the Hero or a Sidekick&#10;         an Enhancement on a Power already in play&#10;         an Edge card with the keyword &quot;Action&quot; or &quot;React&quot;&#10;    &#10;    Activate a Power already in play&#10;    Move the Hero or a Sidekick&#10;    Search your draw deck for a Sidekick&#10;    Recharge your Powers&#10;    Play a Mission card&#10;    Use the Defeat text on a mission to complete it&#10;    Draw 2 cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Unless otherwise specified by the cards played, play continued until only one Hero remained, who was declared the winner.&#10;&#10;In addition to the 33 Heroes available in Arena and the 22 Heroes available in Secret Origins, players could create their own hero using &quot;Paragon&quot; Hero cards. These cards allowed a player to create new combinations of powers that were not available on existing Hero cards. Players could either play solely with the Paragon Hero cards available in the Arena set, or go online to access the HeroBuilder which allowed players to create Hero cards in the same template as the already available Heroes, including a picture uploaded by the player. Although the generic Hero cards listed all power sets available to the archetypes at the time, it wasn't until The Hamidon set was developed that many of those power sets were codified for use.&#10;&#10;",

Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.&#10;&#10;Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.&#10;&#10;",

In both games, players move and capture individual pieces, and each type of piece has distinct moving rules.&#10;&#10;However, Martian Chess differs from Chess in critical ways:&#10;&#10;     Piece ownership is determined not by color but by location.&#10;     Instead of capturing a specific piece, winning is determined by points, making it possible to force the end of the game and still win with no pieces left in that player's control.&#10;     Lastly, Martian Chess easily supports 4 players as well as two, and can also be played with 3, 5 or 6 players if you use geomorphic chessboard sections; see this photo for an example.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Mounted game boards, laminated full color ship control cards and gorgeous full color counters highlight this re-imagining of the Star Fleet Universe with 21st century production values.&#10;&#10;This was the initial product for Federation Commander, and was the original base set.  There are other base sets and expansions for the Federation Commander Series.&#10;&#10;Much effort has gone into streamlining the game - there are 8 impulses rather than 32.  One die roll allocates up to 10 points of damage, rather than 2 dice per damage point that strikes the ship.   Color coded charts and ship cards reduce the mental overhead of remembering what goes where.&#10;&#10;Gone is the tax form of energy allocation, replaced by a free flowing dynamic &quot;on the fly&quot; power allocation system.  Maneuver has had countless special cases removed and streamlined.&#10;&#10;This is not an introduction to Star Fleet Battles, but a re-imagining of starship combat in the Star Fleet Universe, redesigned from the ground up to appeal to a wider audience and reduce rules lawyer-ism.&#10;&#10;Included in the rules are the 'free form&quot; (hexless) movement rules that have been in use for years; the hex map is scaled for miniatures bases, and the game is designed to be easy to port over to miniatures adaptations.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&#10;&#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leader a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&#10;&#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.  Many of the non-English editions use more conventional artwork.&#10;&#10;",

A surprise Confederate attack, led by Albert Sydney Johnston, nearly swept encamped Union defenders into the Tennessee River. The next day, a reinforced Union army counter-attacked and drove the CSA line back in confusion and retreat. A CSA victory might have ruined the career of General Ulysses S. Grant. Instead, the battle ended with a Union victory, the death of Johnston, and the eventual demise of Confederate hopes in the West. Days 1 and 2 can be played separately or together.&#10;&#10;Shiloh was initially developed from the Gettysburg: Badges of Courage game system. However, the game mechanics have been completely overhauled. The map is divided into large areas and combat is resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division or corps. The game plays smoothly and quickly; each player gets to play one day on offense and one day on defense for a great gaming experience. Game time is 2-4 hours for both days of Shiloh.&#10;&#10;",

Your travel office asks you to explore new holiday destinations. Your task is to find the best beaches and the most attractive locations.&quot;&#10;&#10;Aloha is a nice mix of tile play and push-your-luck. Players are travel reps trying to secure the best beaches by placing sun loungers on beaches as they explore the island. The tiles show a good mix of land and water, with 1-3 golden beaches on most tiles. On your turn, you jump your rep to a new place, then draw a tile. This must be placed adjacent so you can walk straight onto it, otherwise your turn is over. If you walk on, and it has a beach, you have the option of dropping a lounger in your color onto it on its side.&#10;&#10;Then you can decide to push your luck and draw another tile. Each time you walk on, you may drop another lounger, but these go onto their sides. When you decide you've done enough or cannot move on anyway, you stop drawing and turn your loungers upright. But if you draw a tile you can't place so that you walk on, you lose all the loungers on their sides back to your pot. The tile still gets placed, and the game has a clever rule. Whenever a tile is placed, it must go where it touches the most tiles. So if the tile is going next to where you stand, sometimes you have no choice, the game forces its placement. But usually you have a few choices and these are crucial to pushing your luck.&#10;&#10;Finally, when all the tiles are down, the island is scored. The longest beach gets a 10pt marker, the next a 9pt marker and so on (with rules for tie-breaks). Then, the player with the most loungers on that beach collects to points markers (more tie-breaks). Also, any loungers still in your pot are also worth 1 pt each.&#10;&#10;At first, you think you must fight over owning beaches, and try to wrest back control of a beach. But in fact you will only win by occupying several beaches, and often you only need 3 or 4 markers to secure control. Being able to start a beach, get control, then extend it to get most points will win. Players can be unlucky and draw un-walkable tiles a few times, but this means you are not picking the correct places when jumping.&#10;&#10;As the game ends, your options reduce, but you should have done your work already. The result is a nice looking island, with lush jungle and bluewater inlets, dotted with lots of loungers.&#10;&#10;You have nothing to do till your turn, but if you make the right choices, you should have a winning chance. Knowing when to go one more tile matters, and knowing when to stop. Players with lots of loungers left in front of them can still win, but may have wasted their opportunities.&#10;&#10;",

The goblins want out, and the only way to succeed with this is to earn the gold coins needed for bribing their greedy guards.&#10;&#10;The fundamentals of Badaboom are quite simple, but there are lots of tricks and tactics that add depth. Basically, the players take turns holding and tinkering with the bomb while striving to do three things:&#10;&bull; Remove valuable mechanisms from the bomb.&#10;&bull; Change the nature of the bomb in a way that is favorable to the current player but not necessarily to the others.&#10;&bull; Make damn sure to stay away from the explosion when the bomb goes off.&#10;&#10;This may sound straightforward, but things are made complicated by the fact that any player can steal the bomb during other players&rsquo; turns. And it&rsquo;s very tempting to steal it. Not only do players get to tinker with the bomb when holding it. They may also draw a card from the deck, and as the deck is placed face up revealing the next card, the players know what they can gain by stealing the bomb. This makes the bomb skip and turn a lot during the game, keeping all players on their toes.&#10;&#10;To win, players need to perfect their timing, make every card count and, of course, avoid losing their heads.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by&#10;&#10;&#10;    Big Badaboom&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "By the winter of 1942, the Red Army of Workers and Peasants had contained the German attacks of the previous summer and fall. Now came the time for a whole series of counter-offensive of its own, designed to cut off and destroy the weakened Nazi armies.&#10;&#10;The northernmost of these would be Operation &quot;Mars&quot;, aimed at the German Ninth Army around the city of Rzhev, west of Moscow in the winter of 1942. The Soviet plan, the work of the brilliant Marshal Georgi Zhukov, called for smashing the already-weakened Germans with a heavy commitment of tanks and fresh troops. When this first objective had been reached, a second operation, code-named Jupiter, would encircle and destroy the German 3rd Panzer Army to the south.&#10;&#10;Despite horrible weather and very rough forested terrain, the initial Soviet attacks went very well. But German resistance stiffened, and as the Red Army failed to make further progress Zhukov reacted by committing more and more men and tanks. Suicidal courage only added to the Soviet casualty lists, and by the time the offensive sputtered to a halt Soviet losses topped 335,000 men and 1,600 tanks.&#10;Little known thanks to Soviet government silence for 50 years, the offensive was designed as a companion to the &quot;Saturn&quot; offensive around Stalingrad. The fact that the offensive was repulsed with heavy losses meant it was not discussed in Soviet accounts of the Great Patriotic War. While the offensive failed to accomplish what the Soviet High Command and General Georgi Zhukov wished, it did provide what the Soviets needed most, a means of keeping German forces of Army Group Center in place while the Saturn offensive in the south ran its course.&#10;&#10;Red God of War covers Operation Mars using the same game system as Alsace 1945 and America Triumphant. Game pieces represent regiments, brigades and divisions. Headquarters are vital to activate units and send them into action; supply is also important to keeping your units at full efficiency and players must choose how to allocate their resources.

        "name": "Kutuzov",
        "description": "Kutuzov is an interactive, play it complete in one-sitting card-driven game of sweeping manoeuvres, epic battles, storied sieges, lethal attrition and crucial-to-win troop morale for one to four players from the designer of The Napoleonic Wars and Wellington.&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1812 Emperor Napoleon of France gathered the regiments of 20 nations together into the largest military force yet raised in Europe. That June he led this Grand Army of over 600,000 men across the Nieman River to begin what he believed would be his greatest and perhaps final triumph: the invasion and subjugation of Russia. As the defending armies fell back before this prodigious onslaught, Tsar Alexander turned to a pugnacious and crafty old warrior to help save his country, his people and his Romanov Dynasty: Marshal Mikhail KUTUZOV.&#10;&#10;Kutuzov uses the same basic rules system as found in The Napoleonic Wars, as it has been modified for even more interactive play in Wellington . As with the later title, there are no diplomatic or political rules: other than those which come into play should Imperial morale fall so low as to trigger the desertion of the Austrians or outright revolt of the Prussians. There are no naval rules other than a Russian ability to move between friendly ports and a &quot;Hornblower&quot; Home Card that allows for a Russian invasion on the Baltic Coast). Kutuzov is thus primarily a game of manoeuvre and combat, where players can recreate the sieges and legendary battles made so familiar to gamers as brought to life in such great books as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.&#10;&#10;As this is Russia, however, not all enemies stand in solid ranks before you. Players must contend not only with their opponents but with Cossack raiders, Polish Lancers, often brutally horrifying attrition, fragile morale, treacherous allies, political events from outside the theatre of war and, of course, &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; and &quot;General Winter&quot; himself, whose scourge effects both invader and defender of Holy Mother Russia.&#10;&#10;110 Cards, most with quotes from the actual participants in that great struggle, drive the game and bring to it the flavour of being in Russia during the 1812 Campaign. The Imperials and Tsarists each have mini- &quot;Home Decks&quot; of a dozen cards each to share, thus increasing the chance that events, forces and options that were presented to the original contenders will arise during play. The other 86 cards, which include many &quot;Must Play&quot; political events, however, ensure every playing of the game will be very different.&#10;&#10;Kutuzov comes with a campaign game that can last one, two, three or four turns - but which includes numerous mechanisms that can bring the game to a &quot;Sudden Death&quot; ending at the conclusion of or even DURING A TURN.&#10;&#10;Mark and Fred, in seeking to deliver more value, variation and enjoyable gaming have provided two other game start scenarios which allow for the game to begin at the commencement of what would be turn two (On to Smolensk!) or turn three (Napoleon in Moscow) of the campaign. A fourth and rather unique method of play allows for two players to each take ONE of the powers from EACH side, in a highly competitive and unusual game of labyrinthine think and double-think. A fifth version allows for two players to play the game using a SINGLE hand of cards each, with &quot;chips&quot; to buy additional cards for their side as the play progresses.&#10;&#10;The Campaign and the Scenarios:&#10;&#10;&quot;Invasion&quot;: A Turn One game start should see the French and their Allies' military juggernaut smash across the border and attempt to catch and annihilate the Russians before they can mass to defend their Motherland Can the players surpass their historical counterparts?&#10;&#10;&quot;On to Smolensk !&quot;: This permits players to avoid the border battles and initial French advances to begin play at a watershed of the Campaign: The Grand Army confronting concentrated Russian forces defending Smolensk immediately before Kutuzov arrives to take command. Will the French advance on Moscow as they did historically or seek victory through an alternative offensive direction&hellip;north to St. Petersberg or south to seize the Ukraine and other southern victory points?&#10;&#10;&quot;Napoleon in Moscow&quot;: In this version of Kutuzov the bloody Battle of Borodino has been fought. The Grand Army reposes in Moscow awaiting Russian surrender or at least agreement to terms. The first chill snow of Winter has fallen, harbinger what's to come: should the French remain deep in Russia hoping to conquer the country or is it time to withdraw to better defences for the 1813 Campaign?&#10;&#10;In all of the scenarios, the Imperial Powers have an initial advantage in numbers, leadership, Resources, and Morale. They are, after all, an Army that has never known defeat; a superb military instrument, led by the most powerful man in Europe with his devoted retinue of almost legendary Marshals. They face an enemy who has not tasted victory in Battle in nearly a generation, let alone full-scale war of the likes of which Napoleon wages. &#10;The French must take advantage of their superiority quickly, as that will soon dissipate in the immense marshes, unending steppes and fiercely fought over fields and cities of Russia. If they do not or can not succeed, then the advantage slips away to the forces of the Tsar, who, under Kutuzov, will not just be defending Russia, but will be advancing into the outer marches of that yet fragile empire led by their archenemy&hellip; Napoleon.&#10;&#10;",

The game uses the same system that first appeared in the popular 1998 Avalon Hill card game Atlantic Storm.&#10;&#10;The game setting is the naval and air war in the Pacific theatre during World War II. Pacific Typhoon depicts the history of the air-naval battles of the Pacific War with 40 battle cards, each of which represents an historical naval or air battle such as Pearl Harbor, Midway, Surigao Strait, etc. Players compete by fighting a non-sequential series of twenty of these battles. A battle lasts for one round of play, so each player gets to play once per battle. The round-leader starts by picking one of two battle cards (he discards the unpicked one). The chosen battle card determines the year of battle. The battle card is also worth a certain number of victory points and resources to whoever wins it. The round-leader alternates after each battle, and the game ends after 20 battles (when the Battle Card deck is exhausted).&#10;&#10;Players are not assigned to sides. Instead, each player has a hand of force cards that typically includes both Allied and Japanese cards. The force cards represent warships, submarines, aircraft, special weapons, and events. Non-event cards have three separate combat values: Air, Surface, and Sub. For example, the battlecruiser Kirishima has combat values of 1 air, 4 surface and 0 sub; the submarine Flasher has combat values of 0 air, 1 surface and 3 sub; the Zero fighter (Sakai) has combat values of 3 air, 0 surface and 0 sub. Force cards are also worth victory points because they can be destroyed in battle.&#10;&#10;After the round-leader selects the battle card, he announces the &quot;suit&quot; of battle: Air, Surface, Sub or Combined. Only the combat values in the announced suit will affect the outcome of the battle. In a Combined battle, the combat values of all three suits are added together. The round-leader also announces the time of battle: Day or Night. Some force cards are only playable in a day battle (for example, the aircraft carrier Lexington), a few are only playable in a night battle, but most are playable in day or night battles. The round-leader then gets to play from his hand. He may play on one side or the other (but not both sides together). Each player after him in turn may then play on one side or the other.&#10;&#10;",

Every player who has a piece of this color or shape in front of them receives a small gold coin for each of these pieces. When playing with the picture tiles, scoring is based on the colors or animals. (with only 5 gold coins)&#10;If the taken piece is the last one of a color and shape, there is a double scoring: 6 (or 5) small coins for the appropriate color and 6 (or 5) for the appropriate shape (or animal) are distributed.&#10;&#10;The game ends if all 36 (or 25) small coins are distributed.  The player with most coins wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Fast Action Battle (FAB) Series - Volume 1: The Bulge&#10;&#10;From Rick Young, designer of Europe Engulfed, comes a series of fun, tense block games. FAB games focus on speed and playability with low-unit density while keeping the history both accurate and exciting.&#10;&#10;Volume 1: The Bulge brings you the Battle of the Bulge from December 16th through December 27th. You command the division and brigade level units using the historical orders of battle. You order your forces to key points, and decide how and when to order extra Assets to bolster them. Note that there are never enough of these Assets to give to all the units begging for them, so you need to weigh your decisions carefully.&#10;&#10;FAB delivers a new blend of units and decisions to the block game genre: your forces are a mixture of wooden blocks and die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Blocks: your divisions and brigades are multi-step wooden blocks with printed labels on one side only, with step-losses represented by rotating the blocks. FAB has a new twist on the units in that the pips on the edges of the blocks are color coded to represent troop quality, which can change as a Division suffers losses. Elite Units can lose their edge and become Veteran, while Green Units can harden and become Veteran as they experience the strains of combat. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Counters: Die-cut counters represent (1) additional Assets available to you as the Field Commander and (2) major Events that could have or did occur during the battle. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Assets represent engineers, army level artillery, independent armor and infantry regiments/battalions, and other small units that can be temporarily assigned to the battles that you deem important to your strategy. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Randomly drawn Events provide divisional replacements, air strikes, interdiction teams, parachute drops, and events unique to each battle in the Series. These Events represent unique opportunities which you can use to influence the outcome, although you cannot count on exactly when these opportunities will be available to you. &#10;&#10;&#10;Another strong element of FAB is the return of Special Actions, which have already been proven in GMT&rsquo;s Europe Engulfed design to give flexible, exciting game play. Special Actions give you tense choices in deciding how and when to seize initiative or interfere with a sudden move by your opponent.&#10;&#10;Series Designer: Rick Young&#10;Series Developer: John Foley&#10;Published: 2007&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wargameroom (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;",
