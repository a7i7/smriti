        "description": "The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord).&#10;&#10;The campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.&#10;&#10;To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:&#10;&#10;        No dice are used&#10;        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.&#10;        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.&#10;        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.&#10;&#10;No dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.&#10;&#10;Legitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.&#10;&#10;The initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.&#10;&#10;Blocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.&#10;&#10;True to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     2 weeks per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     Point to point&#10;UNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     2&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;    Mounted Map&#10;    119 wooden pieces&#10;    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets&#10;    110 cards&#10;    Rulebook&#10;    Two player aid cards&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Matthew Calkins&#10;MAP &amp; BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;(source: GMT website)&#10;&#10;",

Instead, the players play cards capable of moving one of the pawns forward along the paths.  The paths diverge often, giving players a chance to send pawns on longer routes or to get them back onto shorter routes.  Getting a pawn to certain spaces rewards the player who moved it with gold, diamonds or additional cards (randomly assigned by face-down &quot;stepping-stone&quot; markers).&#10;&#10;Once a player moves a pawn onto the temple, the end-zone of the path, the first round ends.  That player gets 1 diamond.&#10;&#10;Next, the players are rewarded and/or penalized for the cards left in their hands, based on the zone the pawns have ended in.  A card for the pawn in the end zone (the one that ended the round) earns +3 gold, +2 for pawns in the second zone, +1 for those in the third, 0 for those in the fourth and -1 for those in the fifth.&#10;&#10;Now the board is flipped to the second side and a similar adventure embarked upon.  This second side has an additional feature: bridges that are destroyed after crossing, further complicating the choices about divergent paths.

So you have to decide: do I wait to put in that snazzy Easter Egg and create the best video game or do I beat the competition by releasing more games to the market?&#10;&#10;Pink Godzilla Dev Kit is a light/medium weight card game for 2-4 players, with enough interesting decisions and tension to satisfy serious gamers but not overwhelm casual gamers.&#10;&#10;The game parodies everything from retro Nintendo classics to the latest Japanese imports featuring a pantheon of offbeat characters like Pixel, the Elders, Jumpman, the Ninja Suppressors, the Good, Evil and Neutral Guardians and Pink Godzilla himself. The artwork for the cards is original, refreshing, and oozing with theme.&#10;&#10;Win or lose, serious and casual gamers alike will enjoy being able to create parodies of their favorite video games.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/devkit/&#10;&#10;",

In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color or number to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw cards from the draw pile until they are able to place a card. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit. Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.&#10;&#10;WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: Victory Lap Card. When played, each player puts their hand face down on the table and passes it to the next player. Only the player of the victory lap card gets to look at the hand in front of them, which they choose to either keep or pass. If they keep passing, the hands keep getting passed around, until the Victory Lap player selects a hand to keep. Play then continues with all players adopting the new decks they now have in front of them.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In a distant land, many and many years ago, rose a big and wealthy city: its name, now forgotten by most, was Hermagor. Commerce was the source of its richness, because from all its territory countrymen, artisans and also adventurers brought to the city every kind of merchandise: weapons, ancient books, precious relics, and rare dragon eggs. In this city, you can buy and exchange everything. This made Hermagor famous and merchants came from afar to buy and sell all kinds of goods at the market. Some even undertook perilous adventures to acquire especially rare items. They criss-crossed this wealthy region, creating new paths and roads, adding markets to towns, but always with the aim to become the richest!&#10;&#10;Set in the imaginary land of Hermagor, each player takes on the role of a merchant striving to be the wealthiest trader. While playing, they aim to acquire goods in the marketplace and then sell those goods profitably in the towns and villages across land of Hermagor. Players first gain access to goods tiles in the marketplace by placing their agents in proximity to the tiles they want.  Then the players move one agent across the map of Hermagor, visiting and selling goods in the towns requesting goods that match the tiles the player acquired in the marketplace.&#10;&#10;Hermagor is played in five rounds with two phases in each round.  Each round begins with the marketplace phase. Players pay to place their four agents in the market trying to control the goods tiles they will use in the second phase of the round.  Control of a tile goes to the player who has the most agents next to the tile.  Ties are broken by the priority of the adjacent locations.  Agents adjacent to the sides of a tile take priority over agents adjacent to the corner of tiles.  An agent placed on a tile has the highest priority.  After all agents have been placed and tiles claimed by the players, the marketplace agents also generate income.  Agents in the same row or column generate income at the rate of 1 for 1 agent, 3 for 2 agents, 6 for 3 agents, and 10 for 4 agents.  The price for placing agents depends on the location.  Locations that apply control to more tiles cost more.&#10;&#10;Each round concludes with selling phase.  Players take turns moving one agent across the map of Hermagor, paying a price for each road segment they use so that they can sell goods in a town or village.  Importantly, each player may only sell in any town or village once during the game.  Players mark each town or village where they have sold goods with a house. Players receive a small monetary reward when other players sell in a town or village that the player has already sold in. Selling goods in all the towns or villages surrounding a region of the map defined by a set of roads potentially gives the player the right to a production facility in that region, supplying additional income immediately and at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Hermagor ends when the last player finishes his turn of the selling phase of the fifth round. End game bonus money is awarded for production facilities, most sales along the major road, and for the smallest of each players sales locations in each of the three Hermagor regions defined by its rivers.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?&#10;&#10;In Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 &quot;glory&quot; points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.&#10;&#10;A big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn &quot;pirate&quot; or remain as a trader or neutral party.

It was thought very little infantry would be needed.&#10;&#10;In the end, when the last Allied troops evacuated, the casualty count for both sides topped half-a-million. (And Churchill lost his job.)&#10;&#10;And yet, the big naval attack had almost succeeded. The Allies would not know until after the war ended how close they had come to achieving their breakthrough on the Dardanelles. It was the first of many &quot;what might have been&quot; episodes, where success was just one more push, one more aggressive movement away...in contrast to many times when failure was reinforced and repeated.&#10;&#10;Gallipoli is held as something sacred by the Australians and New Zealanders... as though they own it. The British would point out that the ANZACs made up less than 10% of the overall force and suffered less than 10% of the casualties. (But you can still get into a fight in Sydney if you talk like this!)&#10;&#10;A Fatal Attraction brings this campaign of tragedy and opportunity to life. The counters represent brigades, batteries, and ships, and players have the chance to do better than their historical counterparts, while gaining a greater appreciation for the difficulties faced by both sides, including supply shortages, command/control difficulties, and random events.&#10;&#10;With A Fatal Attraction, you'll find everything you need to understand Gallipoli except the smell and the flies.&#10;&#10;Published in Against the Odds magazine #20, August 2007&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 week&#10;Map: Area&#10;Unit: Infantry Regiments/Brigades, Artillery Batteries and individual ships&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;One countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12 page Game Rulebook&#10;Four pages of chart &amp; tables&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire suitability - Low&#10;Playing time - Up to 6 hours&#10;&#10;",

The primary game concept is original, but simple, card play players use to permanently improve their influence in the quarter. However, turn after turn, round after round, players must make choices that can have major implications. If one does one thing, then the other can't be done.

Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;",

Those components will be used as reagents in the cure.&#10;&#10;When playing, a player merely chooses an action among three :&#10;&#10;     draw a new card&#10;     add a gem to the pattern, trying to put a reagent in play&#10;     move a gem on the pattern to another place, thus producing an 'alchemy reaction'.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The players use alchemy powers to prevent the opposing team from putting their reagents in play, or to speed up their own production, in order to produce the best cure for the king and be rewarded accordingly. The game ends as soon as one category of gems is depleted, so it is important to delay the end of the game if your team hasn't found the best cure yet.&#10;&#10;The other side of the board presents a completely different game named the &quot;Epic Version&quot;, that includes more diplomacy and roleplaying features.&#10;&#10;Players are powerful mages trying to save the city of Astoria from three disasters : a barbarian invasion, a revolt, and the wrath of a powerful dragon. They develop their powers by creating magic items and putting them in play. Magic items are from six different magic sources, and each source can be used for a different effect on the city. The players use those magical forces to fight off the barbarians and defend the city from the besieging forces. The barbarian hordes will also be reinforced by war chiefs and sorcerers that will add to the pressure on the city.&#10;&#10;The players objective is still to find a cure to the illness of the king of Astoria. But some of the mages are also traitors, trying to lead the king to his final rest and give victory to one of the enemies of Astoria. Players have to watch each other, and may accuse another mage of treachery. They also have to keep an eye for the king's health, for if he dies, everything will be lost for the defenders.&#10;&#10;The game has different endings : the king can die, or can be saved. Or the city may fall to the hands of one of the enemies of Astoria. If one of the enemy factions comes to its maximal force, the game immediately ends with the victory of this faction (and, possibly, the victory of the traitor that was secretly supporting it!).&#10;&#10;Both the Combination and the Epic Versions use a scoring method that makes it possible for players to play the game in competition and tournaments.&#10;&#10;",

But simply reaching the boat does not mean they have escaped as re-capture is always possible, perhaps, even likely. They will not be really safe until they reach their Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.&#10;Each player leads a group of pirates to Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.The path leads the pirates through wild jungle and across the waters of open ocean to the island of Tortuga. In addition to the innate perils of the trip are the other pirates, as each group wants to be the first to arrive at Pirate's Nest and will do what they can to slow the others' progress. As soon as one player has all his pirates in Pirate's Nest, he can raise the Jolly Roger and win the game.&#10;&#10;The game is a sequel to Cartagena with the pirates trying to figure out what to do now that they have escaped from the prison.&#10;&#10;Inside the box:&#10;&#10;    5 game board pieces with 7 symbols: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass&#10;    3 Game board parts: boat, Pirate's Nest and Jolly Roger flag&#10;    105 cards - 15 cards of each symbol: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass plus 1 of each symbol with gold border&#10;    30 pirate figures 6 each of five colors&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player receives seven cards. A turn consists of taking at least one and up to three of the following actions:&#10;1) Play a card and move a pirate forward to the next unoccupied matching symbol.&#10;2) Move an opponent&rsquo;s pirate forward to the next space with one or two pirates on it (you may not skip over pirates), then draw one card for each pirate already there (max. 3 pirates on any one space at the same time).&#10;3) Sail the boat between the islands.&#10;&#10;To sail the boat to the second island, you must have at least one pirate in the boat. If, at the start of your turn, your pirates outnumber the pirates of your opponent/s, you may sail the boat as a free action.

Two maps cover Europe and North Africa from Caucasus to Ireland and from Sweden to Egypt. 780 counters personify land and naval units as well as every corps-commanding leader of that time. The combat units are army corps and fleets, and sometimes entire armies. Their content varies with the player&rsquo;s will and the contingencies of that era; Guard, line infantry, Elite, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, militia, Cossacks, and so on. The game turns are season-based and interactive, including a variable number of impulses. A budget phase occurs every fall.&#10;&#10;The game can involve two players (one French and one anti-French), or five players (France, Great-Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria), or even seven players (Spain and the Ottoman Empire have their own player). Of course, victory conditions vary accordingly.&#10;&#10;The operational part of the game points out the importance of leadership and line of communication; attrition can be very high. Evasive actions and interceptions lead to the deployment of armies followed by battle. Battle occurs in the same hex; troop quality, tactical choices and leader values are taken into account in the issue of the battle.&#10;&#10;At the strategic level, the players are responsible for their unit&rsquo;s production and maintenance. Diplomacy is the key point in creating alliances with other powers, major or minor. Moreover, many random events improve the Napoleonic flavor of that time.&#10;&#10;The overall purpose of the Grand Empire is to provide a strategic Napoleonic game that takes into account historical, military and diplomatic sights, and that can be played in a short period of time (one year is four turns and can be played in two hours) with a reasonable amount of rules.&#10;&#10;Contents :&#10; * Two maps&#10; * 3 countersheets (260 double sided counters each).&#10; * one rulebook and one scenarios booklet.&#10; * 2 dice.&#10; * Tables and charts&#10;&#10;",

The repercussions of their journey continue to live with us today.&#10;&#10;In Kingdom of Heaven - The Crusader States 1097-1291 (KOH) two players use cards to activate forces, trigger random events, conduct diplomacy or prosecute siege warfare on a vast arena stretching from Antioch to Cairo and from Cyprus to Mosul.&#10;&#10;Nine scenarios cover all the major campaigns of the era, from the First, Second and Third Crusades to the Mongol invasion and the rise of the Mamluk Empire.

Turns are yearly, and most scenarios can be finished in 3-4 hours.&#10;&#10;The historical scenarios pit the greatest commanders of the age against one another: Nur ad-Din, Richard the Lionhearted, Saladin, Frederick Barbarossa, Louis IX, Hulegu Khan, Baibars, and many others.

        "description": "Description of the game from Spielbox:&#10;&#10;Gezanke auf der Planke is a three-dimensional family game by Dominique Handel that is already available. Pirates are afraid of water but today is bath day and they all have to go into the ocean. But nobody wants to. Because for pirates, the rules is: he who washes and saves, loses. Nobody wants to go into the water, and so there's a lot of pushing and shoving on the plank. Each tries to stay as far back on the plank as possible and push the others overboard. Finally, a large shark was also spotted happily circling the ship in anticipation.&#10;&#10;16 pirates in four colors stand in rows and columns on the plank. Each player draws a counter out a bag that secretly indicates which his color is. Now each player tries to move the pirates such that at least one pirate of his color is left on board at the end of the game. Players may move all pirates of any color. On a player's turn, he first turns the wind rose. It chooses the first move - if two pirates are exchanged, for example, or move one pirate to the head, the end of the line, or one space forwards, or no action at all. Secondly, a full row of pirates is always pushed on space forwards. So, over the course of the game, pirates fall off the plank - and into the mouth of the waiting shark!&#10;&#10;",
