Cards represent items, treasures, actions, and &quot;reactions&quot;; you're generally not allowed to play an item or treasure card unless your player token is in a specific room on the map. For example, the Rare Coins are not playable anywhere except in the Hall of the Mountain King.

Evade the ruthless Wind Pirates as you collect influence with the powerful Sky Guild. Manipulate the commodity market using your powers of persuasion. Through clever trades and resourceful captaining, you can seize the title of Master of the Sky Guild!&#10;&#10;Each round of Sky Traders takes place in two main phases. In the first phase, players sail their ships and perform actions. To start, each player draws an Ill Wind card, which has a variety of effects that can help or hinder players. The Sky Patrol could attack you for carrying contraband, or the Wind Pirates might try to board your vessel in hopes of plundering valuable goods. If you're lucky, you'll stumble upon a treasure map that leads to riches. It's all up to fate when you draw from the Ill Wind deck.&#10;&#10;You'll add new members to your crew to gain various improvements. Skymen lend their blades to fight off Wind Pirate attacks. Other shipmates can help you earn more money when selling goods. Some crewmembers even make it possible to disregard the results of an Ill Wind card. You'll want to be judicious when hiring crew since they take up valuable space on the ship that could be used for trade goods.&#10;&#10;If your skyship requires repairs or refueling, visit a city. While there, line the ship's cargo hold with valuable textiles, spices, or even jewels, then deliver the goods to another city where entrepreneurs will pay large sums of money for the items. Make sure to stock up on goods when the price is low and sell them off when their value increases.&#10;&#10;In the second phase of each turn, the Guild Council takes place. During this round, players deliberate with each other in hopes of persuading their peers to help influence the price of goods. Strike a deal with your peers and you could force a surge in the value of the commodities you own, but if you've angered your rivals, they may choose to team up and devalue the wares you are selling.&#10;&#10;At the end of the Guild Council phase, each captain also has the opportunity to purchase Influence, which increases his ability to control prices and moves him a step closer to victory. Influence is expensive, but you cannot become the Master of the Sky Guild without it.&#10;&#10;As captain of your own skyship, you'll have to decide each turn how to best service your needs. Buying cargo at one port and delivering it to another city where the goods are highly desired is a great way to turn a profit. However, a captain also must consider hiring new crew, checking the ship&rsquo;s phlogiston (fuel for skyships) levels, repairing damage sustained in pirate attacks, and undertaking other important tasks to keep the ship running at peak performance. When money is tight, haul toxic sludge or collect minerals from the countryside to make some quick money.&#10;&#10;FAQ &amp; ERRATA: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3532&#10;&#10;",

The &quot;men at wok&quot; cards provide special abilities, boosting the points scored for certain types of woks, or allowing you to substitute one ingredient for another on one wok card, or transforming a wok into a fixed number of points with no ingredients required.

        "description": "Blurble - The Hilarious Word Association Card Game&#10;&#10;Blurble is the new, exciting, and hilarious card game that is great for just about any crowd. With 500 different hand-drawn images, you'll have hours of entertainment every time you play, and the game will never be played the same way twice.  Play with a friend while you're waiting for the bus or invite a group over for a game night.  It's small size and varying options for length of game play make it perfect for any occasion.&#10;&#10;Object: &#10;&#10;     To say an English word with the same first letter as the depicted image on the card before your opponent. The player with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Playing the Game:&#10;&#10;     Choose one player to start as the &lsquo;Blurbler&rsquo; (the person who starts the action by flipping a card onto the table). The Blurbler takes a small stack of cards, without looking at the images, and adds more to the stack as necessary.&#10;     Play starts between the Blurbler and the player to his or her left.&#10;     The Blurbler flips the first card from the stack face-up onto the table. The card should be placed at an equal distance between the two players. Each time a card is flipped, a &lsquo;face-off&rsquo; occurs between the Blurbler and the opponent.&#10;     The two players involved race to say any English word, that is not a proper noun or a number, that shares the same first letter as the object on the card. For instance, if the card shows a dog, words such as &ldquo;drain&rdquo; or &ldquo;dairy&rdquo; would be acceptable, whereas &ldquo;David&rdquo; or &ldquo;Denmark&rdquo; would not. Words used must be at least three letters long.&#10;     The first player to finish saying a correct word first is the winner.&#10;     The Blurbler continues to move clockwise around the circle until beat.&#10;     Once the Blurbler is beat, the deck is passed to the player who won that round, and a new Blurbler is born.&#10;     Play always resumes with the player to the left of the new Blurbler.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;&#10;     The player who says a legal word first is the winner of that face-off.&#10;     After each face-off, the winning player takes the card and puts it in front of him or her.&#10;     If there is uncertainty about who said the word first, the other players not involved will vote on who won. If the round is deemed a tie, neither player is awarded the card, and the two players will face-off again with the next card.&#10;     A word may only be said once in a given sitting.  Let&rsquo;s say the octopus card is flipped.  One player yells &ldquo;orange&rdquo; and the other yells &ldquo;oblong&rdquo;.  If &ldquo;orange&rdquo; was said before &ldquo;oblong&rdquo;, then &ldquo;orange&rdquo; cannot be used for the duration of the game, but &ldquo;oblong&rdquo; is still allowed.  If there is uncertainty whether a word has already been said, consult the rest of the table for a group vote.  A redo card can be used to resolve any disputes.&#10;     If an incorrect word is used, for instance a proper noun, a number, a two-letter word, or a word that has already been used, players may continue to shout words until someone says a correct one. There is no penalty for incorrect words.&#10;     A word may not be used if its exact spelling is contained within the depicted image. For instance, &ldquo;rain&rdquo; could not be used for &ldquo;rainbow,&rdquo; or &ldquo;rob&rdquo; for &ldquo;robot.&rdquo; Similarly, if a word is pronounced the same, but has a different spelling, it cannot be used. In the example above, &ldquo;reign&rdquo; could not be used for &ldquo;rainbow.&rdquo; A word with a similar sound is acceptable, so long as it is not spelled out in the depicted image. For instance, &ldquo;row&rdquo; could be used for &ldquo;rope&rdquo; or &ldquo;camel&rdquo; for &ldquo;camera.&rdquo;&#10;     The player with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Winning the Game:&#10;There are several different options of how to structure the game. In all options, the winning player of each face-off keeps that card. These options allow you to structure how long game play will last.&#10;&#10;     Decide on how long to play and set a timer. When the timer sounds, players add up their cards to determine the winner.&#10;     Play to a predetermined number. Once someone has accumulated the predetermined number of cards, he or she is the winner.&#10;     Decide on how many cards will constitute a game.  This can be done by simply grabbing a smaller stack from the deck, or counting out an exact number.  Play until all the cards are gone.  The player who collected the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You attempt to have the most power on the Base from your minions when the Base is smashed. Sounds easy?  How easy is it when an opponent's Alien-Ninja decides to Beam Up your minions to other Bases - flat out Assassinate them? What about when the Pirate-Dinosaur player Full Sails in and releases King Rex to stomp your minions into the ground, or when the Wizard-Zombies use their Mystic Power to create an Outbreak, suddenly flooding minions onto the Base from the discard pile? Or what if you faced a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an Outbreak of massive beasts all at once?!?&#10;&#10;When a Base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, bro &ndash; try harder next time.&#10;&#10;With eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try.

You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the beer you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much beer, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the cup is empty and the sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Loki, the thirsty god of evil, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their beer.

Alternatively a player can skip the round or postpone an attack until after other players bid, but doing so will cause one or more of his outlaws to become wounded. When a player bids outlaws, the sheriff token moves a number of city tiles equal to the number of outlaws bid (in most cases). If a sheriff lands on a player's Chief of the Outlaws token &ndash; as these tokens are located on city tiles and not used for bidding &ndash; one of that player's outlaws is wounded.&#10;&#10;The winner of the bid attacks a city, most likely netting him gold and possibly giving him new outlaws (as they are freed from that city's prison), but which city is attacked is determined by the difference between the winning bid and the lowest bid.

A wounded outlaw who is wounded again is removed from the game.

        "description": "Battle For Souls is a card game pitting the seven archangels of heaven versus the seven princes of hell in a fight for the eternal souls of humankind.&#10;&#10;In the game, 1, 2, or 4 players choose the side of heaven or the side of hell. Each side will battle for 28 souls, which are worth victory points. Players add holy or unholy points on the souls in play based on how they use temptation, virtue, sin, intercession, holy relic, unholy relic, angel and devil cards. Earn enough holy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to heaven, earning the side of good victory points; earn enough unholy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to hell, earning the side of evil victory points. If a soul does not earn enough holy or unholy points and is reaped, it goes to purgatory where its victory points are not counted.&#10;&#10;Guiding a soul to complete purity or complete darkness before death and final judgment adds a new archangel or prince of hell to a player's arsenal. Influence on souls can be spent for more powerful cards that have special abilities, and allow a player to gain souls more quickly.&#10;&#10;Many strategic decisions impact play. Strategies include focusing on gaining more help from heaven or hell to increase your power, working to reap souls quickly from the start with little intervention from the angelic and demonic hordes, or balancing your play to ensure victory.&#10;&#10;Sin, Intercession, and Relic cards can be purchased for beneficial effects at the cost of holy and unholy points. These help to make for deep gameplay and excellent risk-reward scenarios. Invest in these cards to strengthen your position.&#10;&#10;",

Your job is to make compromises, yet always stand by your principles, form coalitions yet still achieve your agenda. To succeed you must herd cats, spin facts into a web of deception, and speak truth to power.&#10;&#10;Enter a world of mudslinging, dirty tricks and the crooks and liars who manipulate the masses, juke the system and corrupt the true believers in order to throw out the tyrants, make the world a better place, and save us all from ourselves. A canny and calculating political operative, you are battling to take over a country in crisis. The old-line political parties are weak and divided, primed for being taken over from within or pushed out of the way. Your movement has captured the imagination of a small but loyal few and now it's your job to grow it into a national force. The goal is to put your handpicked candidate into high office, lead the country, and put your mark on history.&#10;&#10;Democracy: Majority Rules is focused on the retail work of politics at every scale: making friends, forging alliances, outmaneuvering rivals, deceiving enemies, building consensus, selling your point of view, creating a coalition, hiding resentment, feigning weakness, blindsiding foes, and turning doubters into believers. It's all in the game.&#10;&#10;While the game plays 3-5, there is a Party Expansion pack that adds extra components, super supporters worth five normal supporters, and enough materials for up to 15 people. Currently, the Party Expansion is available only on the Kickstarter campaign.&#10;&#10;",

Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, use a goblin's power, draw cards, or pass. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles.

When you buy a tile, you're not claiming land on the game board, but rather investing in that type of landscape as that's where you expect the sheep to end up grazing. At the end of the game, you score 1 point per tile of a terrain type for each sheep in a region of this type; you also score for coins still in hand.&#10;&#10;The map on the game board shows regions separated by roads: three regions of each terrain type for a total of 18 regions. Numbered &quot;rest stops&quot; lie along the roads, with each rest stop between exactly two regions. Shepherds move from one rest stop to another, with the first movement being free and all others on the same turn costing 1 coin. When you buy a terrain, you can purchase the top tile of either of the two terrain types next to your shepherd. When you move a sheep, you move one sheep from a region adjacent to your shepherd to the other region adjacent to that piece, i.e., you lead the sheep across the road to a greener pastures &ndash; well, greener for you, if all goes well.&#10;&#10;Each time you move the shepherd, you place a fence in the rest stop from which it started moving, making that location off-limits for the rest of the game. During the game some regions become inaccessible, and if they are full of sheep, naturally there's a rush for the tiles. The lone black sheep in the game, which is worth two points, serves as a semi-random element, possibly moving to an adjacent region each turn while still being movable by shepherds as long as it's not fenced in.&#10;&#10;After twenty fences have been placed, you end the round so that all players have the same number of turns, then you count up the points.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever best balances these two goals will win the election.&#10;&#10;There are seven offices within City Hall. These offices deal with a different aspect of building the city or campaigning, such as the Tax Assessor, Surveyor, or Zoning Board. In a round, each player will get to activate one of these offices. However, just because you activate an office doesn't mean you will get to use it. The other players will have an opportunity to use their influence to steal control of the office away from you. Keeping it will require countering with your own influence. However, you can instead let another player control that office this round and add their influence to your own, giving you a leg up on controlling things later on.&#10;&#10;In using these offices, players will buy land and build properties to create attractive neighborhoods that will bring the most people into the city &ndash; or they might place a factory next to an opponent's housing complex to drive people out. They will also tax their constituents to raise funds (with the option of sacrificing popularity to tax at higher rates), buy and sell influence to the Lobbyist, and campaign to increase their approval level.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the citizens of the city will vote based on which player brought them in and that player's approval level. Special interest groups will also collect votes for players based on certain goals, such as Wall Street backing the player with the most money. Whichever player has the most votes on election day will become Mayor of New York and appoint his or her opponents to the Sanitation Department.&#10;&#10;",

An individual game supports 2-5 players, while combined they support up to eight players.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out 30 cards in a grid (49 cards with 6-8 players) and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, light/dark, one/two arms, with/without sunglasses, and with/without popcorn. (As noted above, combining the two games adds a sixth attribute: pig/dog nose.) Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot;. The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card (two cards when playing with 6-8). If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.&#10;&#10;Whoever has collected the most cards when the game ends wins!&#10;&#10;Components&#10;96 cards (3 sets of 32 different cards)&#10;1 rules sheet&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you in the cockpits of the world&rsquo;s best Close Air Support aircraft. In Thunderbolt-Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll zoom through canyons hunting enemy tanks and troops while dodging their AAA fire and SAMs.&#10;&#10;Stuffing all this heavy metal in one box has allowed us to expand the normal Leader component set! This game comes with 168 cards and 5 counter sheets!&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you down in the weeds in 8 campaigns spanning the globe. The game system creates immense replayability by pairing a Tactical Situation card with the Campaign card to create a unique environment for the campaign. This means that your campaign in North Korea might be part of a Holding Action, Show of Force, Rapid Deployment, or General War.&#10;&#10;The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world. The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces. If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridge-line to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react. Beware! During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&rsquo;re flying!&#10;&#10;You get to resolve every missile launched at enemy bandits, and every air to ground attack against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, S.P. Artillery, APC, Infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. You also get to resolve the enemy SAM, AAA, and Bandit attacks against your aircraft.&#10;&#10;While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy SAM and AAA assets?&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy tanks before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it won&rsquo;t be able to fly the next day.&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader or Phantom Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Thunderbolt-Apache Leader.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following aircraft:&#10;A-10A Thunderbolt II&#10;A-10C Thunderbolt II&#10;AH-64A Apache&#10;AH-64D Apache Longbow&#10;AV-8B Harrier II&#10;AH-1 Cobra&#10;RQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;MQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;AC-130 Spectre&#10;&#10;Scheduled Campaigns:&#10;Iraq 1991&#10;Pakistan 2013&#10;Libya 1984&#10;Iran 2014&#10;Taiwan Defense 2008&#10;North Korea 2011&#10;Israel Defense 2001&#10;North Atlantic WWIII 1986&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following weapons: Mk.82 Iron Bomb, Mk.83 Iron Bomb, AGM-65 Maverick, AIM-92 Stinger, LAU-68, LAU-61, ECM Pod, AGM-114 Hellfire, AIM-9 Sidewinder, Mk.20 Rockeye&#10;&#10;Target Audience: &#10;This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played co-op (like our other Leader games) by splitting-up the aircraft and planning/resolving missions as a team.&#10;&#10;Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each campaign consists of 2 to 6 turns in which you&rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each day.&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Thunderbolt/Apache Leader&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players act as farmers and operate a cart in which they will harvest produce and deliver them to the five villages to sell. Additionally, players will compete for Produce Order cards, which reward Lira points for selling desirable produce in specific villages. Players track sold produce in each village using their Fulfillment Cards. The winner is the player who gains the most Lire by selling valuable produce, gaining popularity in the villages, and fulfilling Produce Orders.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game Set Up and Play&#10;&#10;During setup in Cinque Terre, colored dice are randomly pulled from a cloth bag and rolled to establish the prices each village will pay for select produce. Each player also begins play with a private order only she can fulfill. Five public orders are turned up that all players can work on, though only the first player to fulfill each public order will score points for it. The Most Popular Vendor cards (1 for each village) are placed face up along one side of the board. The first player to fill an entire row with produce cubes for a particular village earns the Most Popular Vendor card for that village, which provides bonus points. Four Produce cards are turned face up and each player receives 4 to begin with along with a Fulfillment board and Produce Truck in their color.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can perform 3 actions in any order or combination you choose:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take a Produce Card - either a faceup card or one from the deck.&#10;     Move your Produce Cart up four spaces clockwise around the board.&#10;     Harvest produce from the location your cart is currently at. Each produce cube you wish to harvest requires a matching card. Two identical cards can be used in place of any one other card. Your cart can hold up to 4 produce cubes at a time.&#10;     Deliver produce to a village. Unload the produce cubes you wish to deliver and place them in the appropriate spaces for that village on your fulfillment card.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if you complete a public order or achieve Most Popular Vendor, take the appropriate card, scoring the points indicated. You can only complete one public order per turn. When you complete a public order, you must draw a new card from the Order Deck. If you would like to keep that card as a private order, add it to your hand and draw another and place it face up to replace the public order just completed. If you do not wish to keep the card you drew as a private order, place it face up instead. Any private orders not fultilled by game end count as negative points against you.&#10;&#10;Players take turns taking their 3 actions until one player has completed 5 public orders (Most Popular Vendor Cards also count as public orders for determining game end), then everyone gets one more turn, including the player who caused the game to end.&#10;&#10;",

If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.&#10;&#10;If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water...&#10;&#10;",

Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&#10;&#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&#10;&#10;",

Pioneer life was hard, but the men and women who worked and raised their families on those planets and asteroids had much to be proud of.&#10;&#10;Then the rumors began &mdash; whispered tales of frontier abductions and sightings of mysterious creatures.

Families had been stolen away by slavers from the stars, and the peace-loving survivors had no choice but to arm themselves and fight. Fight to stop the alien attacks! Fight to free the helpless abductees!

Each mission features different combinations of aliens on different spaceships, with hexagonal map tiles arranged to form flying saucers, rocket ships, space stations, etc. Cooperation, tactical planning and good dice are essential if the spacemen hope to overcome the relentless horde of little green men.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Legend: History of 1000 Miglia is the first title of a game series that will cover the history of the legendary car race across Italy from 1927 to 1955, starting from Brescia, then going to Rome and back. In particular, this first chapter covers the first years of the competition, between 1927 and 1933, when the biggest cars brands &ndash; Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Mercedes, etc. &ndash; struggle against all the odds in that tough race of 1000 miles (1000 Miglia, in Italian) in the worst conditions ever in the history of car racing and technology.&#10;&#10;The 15 stages are realized by a combination of large hexagons, which represent the Italian countryside and its typical winding roads.&#10;&#10;Particular attention was paid realizing a &quot;playful simulation&quot; in which all 19 cars featured in the game have their own characteristics, historically and technically recreated, after long research and interviews with the actual drivers of each car. So every car features its handling, engine performance and reliability with the goal of finding the right trade-off between simulation and entertainment.&#10;&#10;The driver prepares his car to the race, acquiring spare parts and abilities that will help him along the way. He plans his speed for the turn and moves along the track dealing with different kind of curves, altitude gradients. He has to manage his car through 1000 miles of race, facing technical issues (14 different mechanical area of the car has been covered to model damage and mechanical wear!), changing weather conditions, daylight and nighttime, racing against the other drivers directly side-by-side and against their timing.&#10;&#10;Who arrives back in Brescia with the fastest time wins the 1000 Miglia.&#10;&#10;Previously known as 1000 Miglia: Dawn of the Myth.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Stratopolis, players want to build wide, while also building big.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with twenty L-shaped tiles, each comprising three squares; one player has tiles showing all green squares, green and neutral squares, or two green squares and one red square, while the other player's tiles reverse red and green. Players shuffle and stack these tiles face down, revealing only the topmost tile.&#10;&#10;To start the game, a two-square tile (one red, one green) is placed on the table. Players then take turns adding their topmost tile to the display. A tile can be placed (1) on the table with at least one edge adjacent to an edge in play or (2) on top of at least two tiles already in play. When placed on a higher level, each square of the tile must be supported, the tile must be level, and red and green squares cannot cover one another. (Every other color play &ndash; such as green on neutral or red on red &ndash; is legal.)&#10;&#10;Once all tiles have been played, players count the scores of their zones, to find their best zone: number of squares in a contiguously connected area of their color times the height of the square in this area that is at the highest level. The player with the highest scoring zone wins.&#10;&#10;Variant rules invite players to play with a hand of tiles that they refresh after each turn or to play with all tiles available at all time.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Colorpop seems like a video game brought to the board game world, complete with a cool gadget to mimic the work done by our digital overlords.&#10;&#10;The game board consists of an inclined plastic holder that holds ten racks, with each rack holding ten colored tokens. Tokens come in five player colors (19 each) and the white Jokers (5). To set up the game, slide the tokens into the racks, then place the racks in the holder so that no more than color has more than five tokens orthogonally connected. Each player then receives a token that reveals her color for the game, a token that she keeps hidden from other players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player chooses a group of two or more orthogonally connected tokens and pushes on these tokens so that they fall through the racks and down the holder. (A player can choose to make a joker any color, so she can include or exclude a joker as she wishes during her turn.) Any tokens that were above these will slide down inside the racks. The player keeps all the tokens removed.&#10;&#10;Players take turns removing tokens until either a player is eliminated from the game or no groups of two or more tokens remain. At this point, the game ends and players reveal their secret colors. Whoever has the fewest tokens of her color on the board wins! If two or more players are tied, they compare the tokens they collected during the game; whoever collected fewer of his or her own color wins.&#10;&#10;",
