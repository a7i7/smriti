The game attempts to simulate a sport whereby 2 teams are simultaneously trying to get their ball to the opposite teams starting goal line.&#10;&#10;The board depicts a 7&times;7 grid. Each player starts with 7 ball holders along their edge of the board and their ball in the middle holder. Players subsequently take turns completing the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Moving an empty ball holder orthogonally (up to 2 times); and/or&#10;     Making a ball &quot;pass&quot; by moving the ball from on holder to another along lateral (horizontal) or diagonal line. Pass are not limited in length as long as no opponent pieces are in the way.&#10;&#10;&#10;First person to send their teams ball to a holder on the opponents starting line wins. It's worth noting that an impenetrable wall of ball holders results in an automatic loss to the player who created the wall.&#10;&#10;Nominated for the 2006 As d'Or Game of the Year.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Bo&#195;&#174;te &#195;&#160; jeux (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;Available on iPad (via iTunes Apps Store) since the june 21st 2011 (2 players local game, or 1 player vs AI)&#10;&#10;Strategiespiel nach den Prinzipien von Mannschaftssportarten, mit Bewegung und P&auml;ssen.

        "description": "Bitter End: Attack to Budapest, 1945, is an operational-level simulation of the German attempts to relieve the encircled Hungarian capital of Budapest, besieged by Soviet forces, in January 1945.&#10;&#10;Budapest, Hungary, January 1945&#10;&#10;79,000 Axis troops belonging to the IX SS Mountain and 1st Hungarian Corps are surrounded and being pounded by two Soviet armies, the 46th and 7th Guards. The situation is grim. The Soviets are well- supported by heavy artillery and the German line has been steadily retreating, leaving Budapest in grave danger.&#10;&#10;On January 1st, the German IV SS and III Panzer Corps launch a surprise attack to rescue the defenders and recapture the city. By January 12th the attack is stalled in the rough terrain to the west of the city. Hitler shifts the focus of the attack from the west to the south-west and continues the attack on January 18th. Although progress is made, Soviet reinforcements pour into the area and the offensive grinds to a halt.&#10;&#10;Hitler calls off the attack at the end of January, and by February 14th, after seven weeks of grueling combat, Budapest falls.&#10;&#10;&#10;By January of 1945 Nazi Germany_s military fate was sealed. There was nothing the German forces in Hungary could have achieved that could have substantially delayed or even mitigated this defeat. That did not deter the German attempt to relieve Budapest. Hitler_s goal in ordering the attack toward Budapest was not the rescue of its garrison, but rather the recapture and retention of the city. The garrison was in fact ordered not to break out but instead to hold and await relief. Few commanders on the German side took the idea of the retention of Budapest seriously, however. Had the relieving German forces gotten to within a few miles of the city, a breakout attempt would probably have been made. Bitter End lets the players explore the tantalizing possibilities. In addition, players may test their skills with several viable historical alternatives, such as the inclusion of forces that could have been available to the respective commanders.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (456 9/16&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Bitter End rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed Unit Organizational Charts&#10;Two dual-side printed Historical Set-up Charts&#10;Three dual-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-25 hours&#10;&#10;",

Score the most points investing in the most profitable development companies and putting the best bosses in control of the richest casinos. Put your dollars on the line . . . it's time to roll!&#10;&#10;The game board is broken into 8 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty 'lots'. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and VP. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. VP goes only to the casino's owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents' casinos to make more money.

        "description": "Here's a game that's enormous fun and will sharpen your wits and hone your imagination. The 54 images were designed by Rory O'Connor of Ireland, a trainer in creativity and creative problem-solving. They can be used to arrive at answers or decisions in an indirect and ingenious way.&#10;&#10;Originally Rory had put the images on the faces of a Rubik's Cube, and players would turn the Cube to scramble the images, then choose one side to play with. Kate Jones of Kadon Enterprises suggested putting the 54 images on 9 separate cubes, to allow for quicker ways to generate more varied combinations, including conceptual puzzles. Rory readily agreed, having considered the 9-cubes idea himself earlier. At a creativity conference held at Kadon headquarters in May 2004, a prototype was whipped up, and in 2005 Kadon launched the cubes version of Rory's Story Cubes.&#10;&#10;Each jumbo 1&quot; cube has 6 images or icons, with a total of 54 all-different hand-inlaid images that can be mixed in over 10 million ways. You roll all 9 cubes to generate 9 random images and then use these to invent a story that starts with &quot;Once upon a time...&quot; and uses all 9 elements as part of your narrative.&#10;&#10;Play it as a game for one or more players, or as a party game for three or more. Or play it as an improv game where each player contributes part of the story, picking up where the last one left off. Win award points for speedy delivery, inventiveness, imagination, drama and humor.&#10;&#10;Full instructions include several other ways to use the cubes to solve problems, break up writer's block, enhance your imagination and heighten your ability to find unifying themes among the diverse images. Interpret or get at the meanings of your answers more quickly. It's fun, easy, and mind-stretching.&#10;&#10;As a puzzle the cubes will really give your imagination a work-out. You'll practically feel both sides of your brain dancing. The challenge: Fit the 9 cubes into a 3x3 square. Now examine the cubes in any one row and turn them so their tops have something in common. Do this for all 3 rows. Explain your choices, or challenge another player to identify the element they share. More than one answer may be right, and there are thousands of possible combinations.&#10;&#10;Rory's Story Cubes are recommended for all ages over 8, though it's fun to watch a younger child create combinations with the cubes and make up stories.&#10;&#10;",

The British Home Fleet relentlessly tracked the German warship, and she finally sank beneath a hail of gunfire.&#10;&#10;This Second World War at Sea game has one of the larger operational maps in the series; the North Atlantic is a big and empty place. There are two 34x22-inch maps, covering the area from north of Iceland south to the latitude of Spain. The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.&#10;&#10;The game includes 24 pages of rules and 12 scenarios which feature not just the Bismarck chase, but also the North Atlantic raids made by the German warships Admiral Hipper, Admiral Scheer, Gneisenau and Scharnhorst.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the website:&#10;&#10;The Campaigns of King David is Rob Markham's multi-player simulation of the struggle for supremacy in the biblical area of Israel and its immediate neighbors during the reign of King David.   Two to five players attempt to achieve their victory conditions (control of cities).  The game is 7 turns, each with 5 separate sections. Four of the sections play very quickly (Initiative Determination, Diplomacy, Drawing Phase Chits, and determining if&#10;victory conditions have been met.  The fifth section, Phases, has 12 Actions.  Each Action consists of one specific type, movement/combat, obtaining resources, obtaining food, army maintenance and building, etc. The 12 Actions are chosen randomly with the first six shown face up, allowing the players to know the order.  The remaining six are displayed face down, providing some uncertainty as to the next Action to occur.  As there are 15 Action chits from which to choose, players never know exactly what will occur the second half of the Phase sections. Players must husband their resources and food to maintain their field armies, build and re-equip units, improve fortified cities, and wage battle.&#10;&#10;Play is balanced, with each nation's victory conditions tailored to its historical situation. Game duration ranges from 3 hours for a two-player game up to 5-6 hours for a five-player game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "from GMT website:&#10;&#10;We are proud to announce the companion game to GMT Games' award winning Europe Engulfed. In Asia Engulfed the action takes place across Asia and the Pacific covering the entire war from the attack at Pearl Harbor to the final collapse of the Japanese empire.&#10;&#10;Asia Engulfed is a complete stand alone game or it can be combined with Europe Engulfed to simulate the entire Second World War. A complete set of combined game rules allow for unit transfer, production allocation, and combined victory conditions.&#10;&#10;Asia Engulfed focuses on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. Players actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in 6-to-9 hours once players become familiar with its elegant game systems.&#10;&#10;Wood Block Units:&#10;Wood blocks are used for both land and naval units to provide a realistic fog of war. Different colors are used for not only the different nations but also for land and naval units so there is no confusion as to what is what and who is who. Only the controlling player knows where their elusive carriers are until combat is engaged. Players will have to decide during their naval reaction move if they have the guts to intercept the enemy's unknown forces.&#10;&#10;Supply and Oil:&#10;Asia Engulfed incorporates a unique and simple system to realistically portray the Japanese resource limitations. The further your empire expands from Japan the harder it is to supply and operate your far-flung forces, not to mention defend your perimeter with a navy limited by its oil reserves.&#10;&#10;China, India, and Australia:&#10;All three are in play and potential targets for Japanese expansion. Could any of them been captured if Japan had focused its resources? While it isn't likely, they are targets that the Allies have to defend and often seem just out of reach. Optional rules can bring the Soviet Union into the game.&#10;&#10;Redesigned Air System:&#10;Air assets are critical to a successful campaign in the Pacific, influencing both movement and supply. A carefully designed area map allows air units to exert control into adjacent areas and move across areas to the next airbase without having to worry about tracking range or counting hexes. Carrier air assets are represented by their own counters allowing for their losses to be tracked separately from the carriers and for the Japanese to husband their elite pilots.&#10;&#10;Redesigned Naval System:&#10;The naval system is totally redesigned from Europe Engulfed and along with the air system an integral part of Asia Engulfed. Basing limits, extended range movement, naval reaction movement, carrier day or surface ship night combat, surprise effects, port attacks, invasion support, it's all there and when combined with block limited intelligence and a healthy dose of lady luck every engagement brings the thrill of a potential victory and the fear of a devastating defeat. Even submarines get to put in an appearance as they try to pickoff stragglers.&#10;&#10;Production and Strategic Warfare:&#10;Asia Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include Special Actions, Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, Cruisers, Submarines, Land Based Air and Carrier Based Air units, Infantry, Marines, and an assortment of strategic assets. The USA conducts a strategic submarine campaign against the Japanese naval transport system and later in the war is able to direct strategic bombers over Japan.&#10;&#10;Special Actions:&#10;Special Actions are an innovative rule system to allow for not only extended operations during the course of a normal two month game turn but also to represent each sides unique capabilities. From code breaking to emergency rebasing, special actions provide a wealth of options for the player who has been able to commit the necessary resources to build them.&#10;&#10;Rulebook and Playbook:&#10;The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, combined game rules, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play.&#10;&#10;Integrates With: &#10;&#10;    Europe Engulfed&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Society in this distant time is divided into four powerful guilds. These are the Energy Guild (symbolized by a red sun), the Synthesis Guild (symbolized by a blue fountain), the Control Guild (the most powerful guild of all, symbolized by a green crown), and the Builder's Guild (symbolized by a black tool---yes, that's how tools look in the far future).&#10;&#10;Cities in this future contain two types of structures, towers and domes. Towers are owned by the various guilds. These are the power plants (energy), factories (synthesis), and government facilities (control). Domes are smaller structures used to house the citizens. As with the towers, domes are always associated with a particular guild. Both towers and domes are color-coded to identify guild affiliation; red for energy, blue for synthesis, green for control, and black for builders.&#10;&#10;Each of the guilds wants its towers positioned close to the towers and domes of other guilds (their customers) and far away from its own other towers (to avoid competing with other towers of their own guild). Location, location, location! Some things never change, even in the distant future.&#10;&#10;The Builder's Guild is unique because there are no Builder's Guild towers, i.e., no black towers. Instead, the Builders are compensated for their efforts by being given the profits of some of the other guilds&rsquo; towers that the Builders choose as they construct the city.&#10;&#10;The players in this game are competing builders working to construct the city. At the same time, they are choosing towers for themselves that they hope will be profitable with many close customers and little competition. The choices must be made with care because each builder may only choose three.&#10;&#10;Red, blue, and green large Icehouse Pieces are used for the towers, and piecepack coins with the suit side up represent red, blue, green, and black domes. The land area of the city is defined by a 4x5 array of piecepack tiles, suit side up, with each tile representing four building sites. The game-play consists of the players alternating turns, placing a tower or dome each turn until either all&#10;available towers and domes have been placed or until there are no legal construction sites remaining within the city. Then scores are determined based upon the relative positions of the towers and domes.&#10;&#10;Winner of the piecepack Ludic Synergy design contest.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    Super Duper Games&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Send them into battle. &#10;        3. Clobber till content.&#10;&#10;&#10;Wyrd City&mdash;where conflict lies in wait around every corner and the shadows are acrawl with mystery and adventure, where liberty wanes, government waxes, and a chosen few don capes and cowls to take their stand in a world gone Wyrd....&#10;&#10;Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game features 32 original Heroes (and/or villains, depending on your perspective) and several Crews of secondary characters, including Freedom Patrols, Liberty Bots, Diabloids, Arachnidrones, Darklings, thugs, and zombies. Each Hero is defined by personalized stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, and Vigor) and 3 unique Powers, while each Crew is defined by personalized stats and 1 unique Power. Altogether, Capes &amp; Cowls provides over 75 characters with over 100 Powers.&#10;    &#10;Capes &amp; Cowls is played on a unique Battleboard whose color- and number-coded spaces influence character abilities, modify power levels, and place strong emphasis on strategic and tactical play. Though certain game situations do require a roll of the Battle Die, skillful players will find themselves seldom relying on luck to determine the outcome of an action. In short, the player who recruits and manages his team of Heroes most wisely will nearly always prove the victor.&#10;&#10;Capes &amp; Cowls offers the following 3 modes of play:&#10;&#10;1. Basic: In the Basic Game, each player recruits a team of 2 or 3 Heroes, deploys the team to the Battleboard, and dukes it out with his opponent&rsquo;s team for a predetermined number of rounds. The victory goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;2. Standard: The Standard Game allows each player to recruit a team of 4 or 5 Heroes, and introduces Scene Features such as Rooftops, Walls, and Trees, as well as Objects such as Boulders, Cars, and Mailboxes. These elements enrich the Battleboard environment and call for keener strategies and sharper tactics. The victory, as in the Basic Game, goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;3. Adventure: The Adventure Game requires the players to select an Adventure from the Adventure Book. Each Adventure includes a full-color map for Battleboard setup, instructions for team recruitment, and special rules for playing the chosen Adventure, including team-specific goals and victory conditions. This mode of play incorporates Crew characters, special items, and plot devices that further define the Wyrd City universe and its colorful assortment of costumed denizens. The victory in an Adventure Game goes to the player whose team succeeds in fulfilling the predetermined goal of the Adventure.&#10;&#10;In addition to the above modes of play, Capes &amp; Cowls also allows for solitaire and multiplayer variations.&#10;&#10;Wyrd City&mdash;where the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; are bad, the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; are you, and the dress code is decidedly unusual.&#10;&#10;Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game!

        "description": "In Tara each player strives to become Ard Ri or High King of Ireland.  Through the play of cards representing your supporters and the use of 'cumals' (a cumal is worth three cows), you attempt to promote your followers from Farmers to Herdsmen, through Warriors to Chieftains and finally to the ruling King in the region.&#10;&#10;Tara is played in rounds of three cards.  A round is completed when each player has used three cards.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game the Starting Player deals each player six cards.  Each player chooses three of these cards to use in round one, and puts aside the remaining three cards - you will use the second set of three cards in round two.&#10;&#10;In your turn, you select and play one card from your hand.  Then the player on your left takes a turn, and so on, until each player has played all three of their cards in hand.&#10;&#10;When you play a card, you choose one of four actions:&#10;A    Place pieces into a region;&#10;B    Play a Stone of Destiny card to swap 2 pieces in a region;&#10;C    Discard the card and pay 4 cumals to declare an amnesty that releases all captives from a region;&#10;D    Discard the card to gain 2 cumals.&#10;&#10;If you placed or swapped pieces, you may pay the card's Activation Cost to promote from two of your adjacent pieces to the space immediately above them.  For example, if you placed a herdsman next to another of your herdsmen, you could pay the Activation Cost and put a piece above both herdsmen into the space at the warrior level.  The object is to gain a King in the region by promoting to the King space.&#10;&#10;By placing or promoting pieces you might capture opposing pieces and release those of your own that have been previously captured.&#10;&#10;After each player has played the three cards in hand, there is an End of Round sequence.  Each region may have a traitor.  The player who owns the traitor swaps one of their pieces for an opponent's piece and may then pay to promote from the traitor's space.  Once all traitors have been actioned, players collect income, dependent on the number of pieces they have on the board and their rank.  Then remove pieces from any region containing a new King; the player with the new King establishes a garrison in the region, captives are removed and exchange or ransom of prisoners may occur.  Finally the Starting Player chooses a new Starting Player for the next round.  A new round then begins, using the three cards set aside by each player if they remain, or by dealing another six cards to each player and splitting them into two sets of three as at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has a King in two different regions.&#10;&#10;",

It is designed to entertain a wide range of audiences and age groups.  Keesdrow is ideal to play at family gatherings, an evening with friends, or any time of day when people just need a break.  The game consists of 64 double-sided wood tiles (each tile consisting of four letters with number values assigned to each letter along with a hole for the placing of a colored peg)&#10;&#10;The object of the game is simple.  Players compete for high score by identifying words within a maze of letters and scoring points based on the letters they use.  As players identify words, they insert a colored peg in the hole of each letter used to form the word.  Adjoining letters may be up, down, left, right or diagonal.  The letters must be joined in sequence, and may be used more than once within the same word.  Letters have varying point values, and may be used a maximum of three times during the game.&#10;&#10;The first time a letter is used, it counts as a single point value, and a green peg is inserted in the hole of the letter.  The second time a letter is used, the point value is doubled and a yellow peg replaces the green peg.  The third and final time a letter is used, the point value is tripled, and a red peg replaces the yellow peg.  Once a letter has been used three times, it is expired and may not be used again for the remainder of the game.  (While playing the game, think of a stoplight &ndash; first play the green, then the yellow, and finally the red at which time play is stopped for that letter.)&#10;&#10;The key to making this game so enjoyable is the ability to use the same letter multiple times within the same word, to move in any direction to connect letters and to limit the use of individual letters to a maximum of three times.&#10;&#10;Game contents include a game board, sixty-four wood double-sided tiles (each side contains four letters, numbers and holes), 300 colored pegs, plastic case for the pegs, blue organization bag for the tiles, two-minute sand timer, very descriptive game instructions with color illustrations of the first twelve turns, and score pad.&#10;&#10;2006 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;History&rsquo;s best-known naval battle was just one part of the ongoing four-year struggle to control the seas around Germany&rsquo;s coasts. If the German High Seas Fleet could catch and destroy a portion of the much larger British Grand Fleet, the blockade suffocating Imperial Germany might finally be broken.&#10;&#10;Great War at Sea: Jutland is an extensively updated version of the earlier GWAS Vol. II: The North and Baltic Seas published in 1998. It covers not only the signature battle, but also the many other sorties of the High Seas Fleet like the Scarborough, Lowestoft and Gorleston Raids, the Battle of Dogger Bank and Helgoland Bight.&#10;&#10;Like all games in the Great War at Sea series, this one is packed with scenarios. Along with the operations in the North Sea, the game also includes the bitterly-fought naval war in the Baltic Sea. Here the roles are reversed, with the smaller Imperial Russian Navy aggressively seeking an advantage against the larger German forces. The Russian cruiser raids are all covered, as well as the climactic Battle of Moon Sound.&#10;&#10;The scenario book includes not only more than 40 scenarios, it&rsquo;s packed with the background information about the ships, the men and the battles.&#10;&#10;The map covers the North and Baltic Seas, as well as the waters around the British Isles; it&rsquo;s a bit larger than the map in the previous edition. The smaller navies of the region are all represented as well: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands.&#10;&#10;But it&rsquo;s the major powers that get most of the ships. The Royal Navy is huge, with ships ranging from ancient paddle-driven minesweepers to modern battle cruisers like Repulse and Renown. Famous ships like the battleships Dreadnought and Iron Duke, the inaptly-named battle cruiser Invincible, and early aircraft carriers like Engadine and Argus are all here.&#10;&#10;The German High Seas Fleet has all the ships that challenged England, from the tiny coast defense ship Siegfried up to the huge battleships Sachsen and W&uuml;rttemburg. The Germans have zeppelins and submarines to help redress the balance somewhat, but it will take skilled play to overcome Britain&rsquo;s sea dogs.&#10;&#10;Russia has modern dreadnoughts, but will depend on her armored cruisers and a squadron of older battleships for most missions.&#10;&#10;As with other games in the series, the tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.&#10;&#10;&#10;     32 miles/sea zone campaign scale&#10;     420 1-inch counters, 420 1/2-inch counters&#10;     34&quot; x 22&quot; operational map&#10;     24&quot; x 24&quot; tactical map&#10;     16 page rules, 128 page scenario book&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)&#10;&#10;The war in China-India-Burma theatre is always looked at as through a veil; perceived as a backwater front of the far larger conflict that was World War Two. Nevertheless, this war was vital to the final Allied victory in the Pacific, and even more so to the impact this war would have on the post-war world. Many &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo; could have dramatically changed the world. What if China had surrendered in 1937 and over a million Japanese soldiers would be free to overrun India. There would be no Flying Tigers or Doolittle's Raid, or even Pearl Harbor. If Japan could have mobilized Chinese manpower, the world as we know it might not exist.&#10;&#10;War of the Suns (WotS) was first designed by Leonard To, a Hong Kong native, more than 20 years ago. It won the championship of the First Wargame Design Competition in Hong Kong in 1984. The game has since been updated in the early 90's, and extensively again during the last 3 years. Offering exclusive research based on recently opened Chinese archives, as well as many Japanese and English sources, has made War of the Suns one of the most painstakingly researched and accurate games of its type ever made.&#10;&#10;The title of the &mdash; &quot;War of the Suns&quot;, refers to the flags of Kuomintang China and Imperial Japan. The game itself covers the period from July 1937 to August 1945. The roughly 1:3,000,000 map covers most of China proper, Burma, Assam area of India, and parts of Thailand and Indochina.&#10;&#10;There is a campaign game as well as 5 separate scenarios, and the game can be played as a 1-4 players' game-with players taking the roles of Japanese, KMT, CCP, and British Commonwealth. In the game, politics will play as vital a role in how the game progresses as the units presented on the map.&#10;&#10;Other key game concepts include: &#10;&#10;    The HQ activation system - Players move units under the activated HQ. The number of activated HQs is affected by command points, the quality of HQ selected, and whether China is cut off from foreign routes. Randomness and quality of the HQ affects who moves what first.&#10;    The KMT replacement system - KMT units are divided into 3 levels: The elite units with imported weapons; the standard units equipped with what Chinese herself produced; and the local units which simply bought whatever they could find locally.&#10;    The Political Affiliation system - Each warlord and minor country has its own home territory. They may be affiliated with different players at different levels under different conditions. Friend may become foe with a random or historical triggering event.&#10;    The Guerilla System - From the setting up of guerrilla bases to a unique combat system, Guerrilla actions from CCP, KMT, and even British player can be as active as the front line.&#10;    Optional Rules - The game does not shy away from controversial subjects such as wartime atrocity, opium production, and Japanese collaborators. It also includes an &quot;alternate history&quot; section that probes into many &quot;what if?&quot; situations, e.g. what if Stilwell has not been recalled, but instead was capable of commanding all the Chinese forces?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;War of the Suns Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: 3 months&#10;    Counters: Army [marked as Corps on counters]/Division for the Chinese; Division/Brigade for the Japanese and British [/Western Allies]&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Details:&#10;&#10;    Players: 1-4&#10;    Scenarios: 5&#10;    Complexity: Medium to Hard&#10;    Playing Time: 5 to 34 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;War of the Sun Components:&#10;&#10;    3 22&quot;x32&quot; mapsheets&#10;    1 8-1/2&quot;x11&quot; map overlay&#10;    10 countersheets (176 counters on each countersheet)&#10;    36 page rulebook&#10;    56 page playbook&#10;    8 player aid cards&#10;    4 six-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.&#10;&#10;The war in China-India-Burma theatre is always looked at as through a veil; perceived as a backwater front of the far larger conflict that was World War Two.

He will not hesitate to breath his magic fire on anybody getting too close to his savings.&#10;&#10;So caution Hot stuff, Who will dare enter the dragons lair? Who will manage to bring back the most treasures?&#10;&#10;The basic principle of this small risk taking game is extremely simple. During each round of play, all players simultaneously choose an adventurer, from the four of their respective team, which they wish to send into the cave to recover treasures.&#10;&#10;This choice will be done according to a &quot;crystal ball&quot; prediction, which is never highly reliable.&#10;&#10;So players must bear in mind the power and the range of the flame of the dragon, and the &quot;fire resistance&quot; of each adventurer (from very weak for Spark, to very high for Ice Breaker). Also because the cave is narrow the placement of the adventurers in the cave is very limited.&#10;&#10;An ascending order of fire resistances will be carried out. In fact, the more resistant an adventurer is, the slower he runs. In other words, the more you take a risk, the higher your choice of placement will be, but the more likely it is your adventurer will get scorched.&#10;&#10;Lastly, to protect your valorous adventurers from the small sudden changes of mood of the dragon (anger, fury...) as well as the various tricks of your adversaries, who will surely never miss an opportunity to prevent you from recovering treasures, you will have at your disposal a complete set of magic items tailor-made for this kind of &quot;sport&quot; so it's up to you to use them wisely.&#10;&#10;The winner will obviously be the player who has piled up the most treasures at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Other children can break up a fight by landing on that same space, or tattle by landing on a nun's space. If a nun moves onto the fight space, the attacker is sent back to the entrance for detention. Finishing thirty of the minute-long turns marks the end of the game, or it ends immediately when one player's boy and girl figures meet on the same space while out of sight of the nuns.

Each conquered tile creates new opportunities to tackle tougher tiles around it, both for you and your opponents (so you have to be careful!).&#10;&#10;Conquering a tile gets you a reward equal to its difficulty level. This money is used in the game to purchase assets and abilities, and it is also used to determine who has won this game, once it's over.&#10;&#10;A number of magic cards introduce a variety of special effects and abilities that can greatly benefit the players.&#10;&#10;The game includes two rule sets, Normal and Advanced, that play very differently:&#10;&#10;    The Normal game is very accessible; it is a lighter game that plays with little downtime and yet has a lot of strategic depth. &#10;    The Advanced rules lead to a more complex game that can sometimes be a bit of a brain burner.

Players alternate playing cards and moving pieces. The game sequence is very interactive, with NO down time waiting for the other player to take his turn. The combat system has both players rolling dice in each combat.&#10;&#10;In this two-player game each player starts the campaign game and 1914 scenario with cards that also represent the prewar stocks of ammunition, reserves and planning that allows the war to start off with a large bang. After players expend this allotment of cards, they must purchase more cards along with new units. Each player's resources are limited, so players often will not be able to launch large offensives every turn. They'll need to husband their resources. This represents the preparation for the next &quot;Big Push.&quot; All of this leads to difficult game decisions all the way through the game.&#10;&#10;There are scenarios for each year of the war from 1914 to 1918, along with the hypothetical Fuller or 1919 offensive. Also included are the many war plans conceived prior to the war and their appropriate set-ups so you could, for example, try the French 1909 plan vs. the German Schlieffen Plan.&#10;&#10;Rules include: Great Offensives, Stosstruppen, tanks, gas attacks, cavalry, huge dogfights, reserves, siege guns, forts, events on other fronts, and much more.&#10;&#10;",

While the lucky ones made their fortunes; most folks barely scratched out a meager existence in these harsh and lonely towns. Some died lonely deaths in these places far from home, and now their souls wander around these ghost towns haunting them until the day when their soul can return home to achieve final peace. The ghost trains are these lost souls&rsquo; ticket to rest. These spectral trains glide majestically along ethereal rails looking for lost souls and give them passage homeward. You are the engineer of a ghost train. Your job is to find lost souls in various ghost towns and deliver them to their home towns so that they can achieve final peace&#10;&#10;Players are Engineers of Ghost Trains traveling through the American Southwest. Each player uses their standard set of Ether cards (1-4) to move, picking up souls and delivering them to Ghost Towns. As you move, you expend Ether to lay track behind. Other players can move along on your Ether track for free, but you may never travel along your own Ether.&#10;&#10;As you lay down more track, your old Ether disperses -- you can pull up your track to clear the way for yourself or to leave someone in the lurch.&#10;&#10;A portion of the game revolves around managing your discard pile, as you only get half of your ether cards back each turn.  But most of the game comes down to proper planning along with timing your movement to take advantage of what other people have left you, while trying to disallow easy passage for others.&#10;&#10;",

The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary.&#10;&#10;Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).&#10;&#10;Several of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.&#10;&#10;Runebound is playable solo and is expandable by many adventure packs that alter the final challenge (replacing the Dragonlord for example). Runebound 2nd Edition also has a series of big box expansions that provide a new map or central map overlay to alter the game in some way.&#10;&#10;Runebound 2nd Edition is different from 1st Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by 2 10-sided dice, which helped to better balance the luck factor.&#10;&#10;",

The new piece placed must touch another piece of the same colour, and it can only touch corner-to-corner or corner-to-edge. The constraint is that a piece can never touch another piece of the same colour edge-to-edge.&#10;&#10;When a player cannot place any more pieces on the board (either because they are blocked and can't fit any more, or because they have already placed all of their pieces), they must drop out of the game. The other players continue until no one is able to place any more pieces on the board.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each player must count the number of triangles that they were unable to place on the trigon board, and calculates their score as follows:&#10;&#10;     Each triangle that is not placed on the board counts as a negative point.&#10;     15 points are awarded as a bonus, if the player has all 22 pieces placed on the board.&#10;     This bonus increases to 20 points if the 22 pieces were placed on the board with the single triangle piece being placed last.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Players can choose to play multiple rounds and keep a running tally of the scores.
