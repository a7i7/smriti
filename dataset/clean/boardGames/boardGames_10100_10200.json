        "description": "Throughout the centuries, mad scientists have always encountered the same problem of very limited access to the dangerous resources they require. To solve this problem, the Mad Science Foundation was created. Now these &quot;misunderstood geniuses&quot; can finally get the access they need to the four vital building blocks of mad science: Lasers, Dark Matter, Cryptomium, and Sharks.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, for each mad scientist who seeks &quot;funding&quot; from the Mad Science Foundation, there remains the unfortunate fact of life that mad scientists do not play well with others. In the quest for infamy, directors will be bribed, resources will be reallocated, spies will be dispatched, inventions will be sabotaged, and big, ominous buttons will be pressed with catastrophic results. Welcome to the Mad Science Foundation, where everyone is ready to stab you in the back with overly-elaborate backstabbing machines.&#10;&#10;At heart, Mad Science Foundation is a drafting game. You draft resources to craft wacky inventions and dispatch minions to help with your diabolical plans. Each round, one player controls the Crooked Director for that round. They then separate the available commodities into piles to be drafted. It's up to the scientist controlling the Director to determine the value of whatever resources are available and separate them into piles. Not all piles are created equal! Players then take turns selecting which pile of goodies to grab, with the Director's controller choosing last. Sizing up your competition is key! You know what they need; don't let them have it. Or give them two choices of equal terrible-ness! But each player also has a secret side objective that you may not figure out until it's too late...&#10;&#10;By crafting new inventions, you might be able to put together an engine of cards that eventually fuel themselves. Perpetual motion in our lifetime! Or perhaps you might stockpile valuable resources for later exploitation. It's all done with the altruistic goals of megalomania and personal glory in mind. What could go wrong?*&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Mad Science Foundation is not responsible for stock market crashes, illegal dumping, or tears in the fabric of space-time.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

These cards have two halves, each with icons representing the influence in one or two of the groups. Every round each player selects one card secretly, touching the side of the card they want to be valid, then all players reveal/place their card simultaneously. The players add their played card to their display, overlapping the cards, so that only the half that they touched when revealing the card is seen. The other half is taken out of play for this game.&#10;&#10;Some cards show icons that allow you to collect victory points immediately. When doing so, you compare your total of power of the specific group with each of the other players, scoring some points for each player you beat and less in case of a tie.&#10;&#10;In game end scoring, you compare all symbols with all of your competitors and gain additional points when having more symbols of a kind, and fewer points in case of a tie. Finally, you score more points for each face-to-face victory when comparing the symbols on cards you have taken out during the game as part of the city wall.&#10;&#10;Scoring during the game weakens your display because the scoring symbol is only on card halves with a single icon of influence, while other card halves show up to three icons.&#10;&#10;Tallinn is the second game in the cycle of little tiny card games of Medieval Theme in the Baltic Sea by OSTIA-Spiele, following VISBY.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, the players each select one card to leave in their kingdom as a &quot;relic of the past&quot; to help them in later rounds. After three rounds, the player with the the most prosperous kingdom wins.&#10;&#10;Tides of Madness adds a new twist to the above game: madness. Some cards, while powerful, harm your psyche, so you must keep an eye on your madness level or else risk losing the game early as your mind is lost to the power of the ancients. More specifically, eight of the eighteen cards in the game feature a madness icon, and while scoring, you receive a madness token for each such icon in your collection of cards. Whoever has the most madness in a round either scores 4 points or discards 1 madness token &mdash; and the latter option is valuable because if you ever have nine or more madness, you lose the game immediately.&#10;&#10;",

Staying on top proves difficult as every stolen die moves other players up the ladder toward taking over as Don, so the tension rises with each shake of the dice.&#10;&#10;With multiple ways to use each die you roll, players never find themselves at the mercy of the dice, instead using what they roll to make their opponents beg for mercy.&#10;&#10;",

Players compete to kill monsters and take their blood.&#10;&#10;In general, Bloodborne is a game about risk management with a bit of group think, inventory management/upgrades, and tactical play. You start with a hand of basic weapons, which you get to upgrade to improve your fighting combos and capabilities.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one monster chosen at random attacks players, who fight back as a team, with everyone playing a card from their hand simultaneously to attempt to kill the monster. Players collect blood from the monster, assuming it dies, based on how much damage they dealt. Monsters can fight back with exploding dice that can potentially deal infinite damage.&#10;&#10;Players can fight as long as they want, but if they die in combat, they lose their progress. Players can opt out of fighting to bank their blood and save it permanently. Collected blood counts as victory points.&#10;&#10;Says designer Eric M. Lang, &quot;My goal with Bloodborne was to channel the intensity and frustration of the video game into a contest between players. Lots of death.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Canada&rsquo;s westward expansion was very different than that of the United States. In the U.S., conflict in the westward movement was between the White Man and the Native Indian, and a common language united U.S. settlers. Language, however, has divided Canada ever since General Wolfe united the country by arms at the Plains of Abraham.&#10;&#10;Canada&rsquo;s settlers pushed westward, led by fur-traders and trappers who were predominately French Catholic. These pioneers intermarried with the Native Indians, producing a new race and a new culture &ndash; the M&eacute;tis.&#10;&#10;When the Canadian government made treaties with Native Indians, the M&eacute;tis, being neither Native nor White, did not receive any comparable consideration. Wanting to protect their rights against the remote Anglo-Protestant government in eastern Canada, resentment grew into rebellion in Manitoba's Red River Valley in 1869. Louis Riel led this resistance and forced the government into compromise, resulting in the Manitoba Act.&#10;&#10;Due to his participation in the rebellion and in the execution of English Protestant, Thomas Scott, Riel himself was forced to flee to the United States. While residing there, Riel obtained American citizenship.&#10;&#10;When trouble between the M&eacute;tis and the government occurred further west, in Saskatchewan, the M&eacute;tis recalled their former savior to lead them. Louis Riel and Gabriel Dumont, a local M&eacute;tis leader, initially worked toward a peaceful solution for their grievances. However, this movement eventually grew into a resistance, known as the North West Resistance. The Conservative government in Ottawa amassed a military force to crush it, and finally did at the Battle of Batoche, 9 &ndash; 12 May, 1885. Gabriel Dumont fled to the United States; tried and hanged for High Treason was Louis Riel.&#10;&#10;There are many reasons why the first Riel resistance succeeded and the second failed. The westward expansion of the railroad allowed the federal government to deploy superior forces rapidly to the field. Riel himself embraced unorthodox religious views &ndash; views that alienated the Catholic Church and its devout supporters who were the key to his first resistance&rsquo;s success.&#10;&#10;Now you enter the courtroom during those five fateful days of July, 1885, when the future of a country hung in the balance, and the defendant, Louis Riel, hanged in the aftermath.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In DIG, each player is a dog that will run throughout the Yard, dig up bones and attempt to return them to the matching colored Dog Bowl with the greatest efficiency. All players will score once, at the end of the game, based on the cumulative value of the Bones that he returned to the matching Dog Bowls.&#10;&#10;There are 4 Bones in each of the 5 colors in the game. A Bone's value is determined at the end of the game, based on the distance of its corresponding Dog Bowl to the Dog House. The Dog Bowl that is closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 5 for each bone of that color. The Dog Bowl that is second closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 4 for each bone of that color, and so on. The Bowls and Bones will be swapped from the end of the Yard into the place of a recently dug up bone, continuously moving the 5 Bowls to the end of the Yard nearest the Dog House.&#10;&#10;Each Yard Card has a Scent with 2 colors. The Bone on the opposite side of the Yard Card matches 1 of the colors of the Scent. This will help players determine which color Bone might be dug if that Yard Card is selected for digging.&#10;   One of the most interesting aspects of DIG is the unique &quot;Leap Frog&quot; Yard replacement mechanism. When a Bone is dug up, the Card that is furthest from the the Dog House, is removed and fills the empty spot created by the Dog. This action creates some interesting ways to influence which Bones and Bowls each Dog has close access to, but also makes timing critical for influencing Bone value for scoring.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he may perform ANY or ALL of the following actions, but may only perform each action ONCE per turn.&#10;&#10;MOVE: A player may move his Dog a maximum of 4 cards along the Yard Cards, and 1 less for each Bone he holds prior to movement. For example, if a player holds 2 Bone cards, he may move his Dog up to 2 Cards, moving below or above the Yard cards. A player may move his Dog in any direction. There is a movement legend on the bottom half of the Dog House for easy reference.&#10;&#10;DIG: A player may dig up a bone and place the Bone card in his hand. Bones that are in the hand are kept secret until they are dropped off and placed in front of the player. The empty space created from the Yard Card removal is filled with the last Card at the edge of Yard. A player may have no more than 3 Bones in their hand at any time.&#10;&#10;DROP: Drop a Bone into a Dog Bowl and place the Bone card from your hand to the playing area in front of himself, face up with the Bone visible to all players. A Dog must be AT the Bowl of the corresponding color in order to drop off any Bones of that color.&#10;&#10;Game End and Scoring:&#10;   When Bowls are the only remaining Cards in the Yard (next to the Dog House), the game ends immediately and players total their scores. Any Bones still in a player's hand are removed from the game and do not count for scoring.&#10;&#10;",

This is the fog of war...&#10;&#10;The Fog of War is a two-player grand strategic game covering the European theater of World War II from 1940 to 1944. One player plays the Axis forces, and the other the Allies.&#10;&#10;The game does not have units that move around a map; instead the game focuses on the planning and intelligence aspects of the war. Each player has a deck of cards that represent the army, navy, and other assets of their nations. A map shows the 28 land and sea provinces over which the players are battling.&#10;&#10;You defend a province by placing cards face down on the map. If you wish to attack a province, you must plan an &quot;operation&quot; to do so by creating one on your operation wheel. The wheel is a unique way of forcing players to commit to operations in advance, while giving opportunities for intelligence gathering and bluffing. An operation consists of a province card that shows the target of the operation, plus one or more cards to conduct the attack. All of these cards are placed face down, so your opponent does not know the target of the operation or the strength of the cards that are taking part. Each turn, the dial on the operation wheel is rotated by one position. This controls when an operation can be launched and any attack or defense bonuses that apply.&#10;&#10;In addition to combat forces for attack or defense, you may also spend Intel tokens to look at your opponent&rsquo;s operations and defenses.&#10;&#10;",

The peculiar strength of the game is the innovative resource management: Each player has a finite amount of matter, energy and antimatter that they can produce or spend during the game. In each round, they can decide to burn forever one or more resources to perform powerful actions, thereby allowing them to follow different strategies.&#10;&#10;",

Spell cards each have 4-6 different magic symbols on them. Each player starts with 2 Spell cards and then draws 1 new card every turn. You can never have more than 6 Spell cards in your hand at once though. The goal is to pair up matching symbols across your Spell cards to create hands, sort of like a weird, alternate universe version of poker. Once you've matched up a complete Spell hand, you trade it in to draw Summon cards. How many Summon cards you can draw in a turn depends on the complexity of the hand you trade in for it.Summon cards depict a deity, demon, or monster from a variety of mythological, religious, literary, or just plain made-up sources. Each Summon card has an ability that you can play against your competitors to make them lose turns, discard spell cards, or other nefarious setbacks. Each and every Summon card you play puts you one step closer to victory, until...&#10;&#10;For a 30-45 minute game, the first person to play 7 Summon cards wins! Want a longer game? Really challenge yourself and play to 13 Summon cards. That's the basics. Pretty simple, huh? Oh, one little twist I forgot to mention...&#10;&#10;Included in the Summon deck are the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They're extremely powerful cards by themselves, but if by some unholy fluke you manage to draw and play all four of them in a game, you win instantly, no matter how many other Summon cards you've played.&#10;&#10;And... shuffled into the Spell card deck are also Curse cards, which can totally throw off even the best player's strategy. They can make YOU lose turns, give other players cards, or other setbacks, so watch out! The tables can turn at any time and nobody is ever safe for long.&#10;&#10;",

These changes turned out to be not only theological, but also influential in the Reformation in other ways: the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded people's faith in the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much of traditional thought. The Roman Catholic church responded with a counter-reformation initiated by the Council of Trent.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game Sola Fide: The Reformation, by the renown design team of Jason Mathews and Christian Leonhard, players attempt to install Reformation in the Holy Roman Empire or try to prevent it, battling the Holy Roman Empire's Imperial Circles.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player takes the tile to their left, right or front; moves their figure to the space just vacated; then draws a tile to place where their figure started the turn.&#10;&#10;When adding an animal tile in your park, you add its main landscape &mdash; the base space for the animal &mdash; to your park, too. While placing this new animal, its own piece of landscape can help to fulfill the requirements of your other animals' requirements, e.g., the water on a hippo tile fulfilling the adjacent otter's need for water. Thus, fulfilling every animal's desire for land becomes a more and more difficult task with each tile you add.&#10;&#10;Aside from expanding your park with different landscape types, flora and animals, you can improve its profitability by building extra entrance roads, trek spots, and watchtowers.&#10;&#10;Habitats lasts three seasons, with each season giving each player 6-9 new tiles for their parks.
