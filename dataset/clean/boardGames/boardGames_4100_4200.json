Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.&#10;&#10;Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper &mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.&#10;&#10;All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no on can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players start at the well and their objective is either to kill 25 points worth of skeletons or to collect the Necromicon from the graveyard and return with it to the Altar.  The various skeletons are worth different points, White are worth 1, Red are worth 2, and Blue are worth 3.&#10;&#10;Players start by drawing a tile and placing it on the board anywhere it will fit.  They then place a number of skeletons and villagers as shown on the tile.  They then roll a six-sided die (d6) for movement.  Movement is orthogonal and limited to the tiles currently in play.  If you encounter a villager you can collect it; skeletons you encounter must be overcome.  At the end of your turn you again roll the d6 to move that many skeletons 1 space each.&#10;&#10;Players can collect up to 5 villagers who can be sacrificed if they lose a fight.  Combat is simple - enter a square with a skeleton and on a 4 or better on a d6, you win.  If the roll is less than 4, you can either sacrifice a villager or pay skeletons to reach 4 or better.  There is no change, so if you roll a 3 and only have reds, you now have a 5.&#10;&#10;Some of the cards also require specific colors of skeletons be used in order to power them and many require that you kill skeletons in order to play them.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches the Graveyard and grabs the Necronomicon, the other players can attack him during their turns to try to steal it away from him.  The game ends when someone takes the Necronomicon to the center tile of the Altar or collects 25 points worth of skeletons.&#10;&#10;This Zombies!!! sized box contains 30 map tiles, 50 event cards,  6 pawns, 50 sculpted life counters (little gray dudes), rules and 100 HEAVILY ARMED AND ANGRY SKELETON WARRIORS!!! The whole game is done with the same realistic but very tongue-in-cheek style you have come to expect from Twilight Creations.&#10;&#10;Part of the MidEvil/Zombies!!! series&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Midevil II: Castle Chaos&#10;    MidEvil III:  Subterranean Homesick Blues!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Goods shipments, intended for transport along sea routes, are in danger of gathering dust in the warehouses or being lost at sea in a storm. While the players speculate about success and failure, the ultimate fate of the ships will be determined by the dice.&#10;&#10;There are four shipments that need to get to Manila - jade, ginseng, silk and nutmeg. A round begins with an initial auction to become harbour master. If you win, you'll be allowed to buy a share of one of the shipments, choose which three shipments you'd like to take down river and how likely they are to make it to their destination in the harbour. If they make it to Manila, their share price will increase. The aim of the game is to bet on the outcome of these shipments, with dice ultimately determining their fate. How many of the three boats will make it and which ones? Would you like to provide insurance against possible failed ships or perhaps you think pirates will snatch a chance to take control? Manila is a fun family game that takes minutes to learn and brings the river boats of the Philippines to life!&#10;&#10;",

This exciting and unique card game invites players to compete to get the best directors and most famous actors for their films. With an easily accessible theme, and simple but deep gameplay, The Hollywood Card Game appeals as much to casual gamers as it does to hardcore strategists.&#10;&#10;The game plays over 3-4 rounds (the same number as the number of players), with each player having one turn to play first. Each round a new Hollywood Area is created by shuffling 3 Star cards and 11 Movie cards together and dealing them out into 4 columns. Players take turns either placing a marker on the bottom card of a column (pushing the preceding markers up the column), or playing one of their Studio cards (Skip a turn, or take two turns in a row). Each studio card can only be used once per game. Once each card in a column has a marker on it, that column is closed, and no more markers have been played in this column.&#10;&#10;Once all players have run out of markers, the round is over, and cards are allocated to players based on the marker on the card, and starting from the TOP left corner. Cards are allocated one at a time, and must be used on a Project immediately. Film cards must be allocated to a Project of the same genre (Horror, Action, or Romantic Comedy), or allocated to a new project if the player does not already have a Project of that genre. Star cards must be allocated to any project, however this will immediately complete a Movie, which no more cards can be added to. If a Star card cannot be allocated to a project, they cannot be held to add to a later project. Movies score points for the number of Film cards in them (with Award Film cards counting twice), multiplied by the number of stars on the Star card. Blockbuster cards stand alone and are worth 2 points each. Additionally, each player scores one point for each Film card in their largest unfinished project (no ties allowed). The player with the most points wins. If players are tied, the player with the single most valuable movie is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Hollywood Card Game contains 64 cards, 16 film reel chips, and a rule sheet.

The Standard Rules are common to all four games.&#10;&#10;Game scale is one mile per hex and 12 hours per game turn.  Unit sizes range from battalion to Brigade.

The Standard Rules are identical to those used in the first Modern Battles (Quad).  In this new series the same scale is used (one mile per hex and 12 hours a turn). Units range in size from companies to brigades.  Artillery units have the ability to add to the defensive strength of friendly units being attacked. Artillery has various ranges, some in excess of ten hexes.&#10;&#10;Also included (in various games) are rules for Untried units, special river conditions, other special terrain, airpower, ammuniton depletion, B-52 and B-1 bomber attacks, commandos, paratroopers, stacking, garrison units, bridge destruction, militia, artillery suppression, command control, helicopters, replacements and international cooperation.&#10;&#10;Movement is sequential and single-phased. Zones of Control are rigid, and combat is mandatory between adjacent units. The Combat Results Tables (there are two, representing different doctrines) use a differential system.  The &quot;Active Combat Results Table&quot; is very bloody, with a large possibility of exchange and elimination, even at low odds. The other table, the &quot;Mobile Combat Results Table&quot; is a bloodless CRT, offering mostly retreat results.&#10;&#10;Terrain varies from flat, open plains to some of the most rugged in the world. The terrain effects on combat are taken into account by a system whereby the combat differential is actually altered (column sifts) by the terrain the defending unit occupies.&#10;&#10;",

The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows). On a player's turn, they must place a tile and may then place a follower on it.&#10;&#10;As in the original game, tiles may only be placed so that identical landscape types match up. A follower may only be placed when no other follower has been placed there yet. When the follower is removed, however, then the size of the region in which the follower is located brings points - regardless of whether the region has been closed off or not, although closed off regions score considerably more points. There's also an additional rule that lets mountainous regions increase in value, even if they've already been completed.&#10;&#10;This is a distinctly simpler version of Carcassonne than the original. This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower). Since the regions can only get more valuable, this ensures many agonizing decisions.&#10;&#10;(From Gamewire and Spielbox)&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;",

The two dealers want to store spices so that they know where everything is, but they also have to keep the rats at bay.  Stack your crates, keep your spices together, and cover up the rats.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rat Hot is a two-player game developed from Michael Schacht's Dschunke: Das Legespiel on his own label Spiel aus Timbuktu, which in turn was developed from his game Dschunke, also published by Queen. The Rat Hot tile distribution differs slightly from Dschunke: das Legespiel but you can very nearly use the Dschunke: das Legespiel rules with a Rat Hot set.&#10;&#10;All the games use the clever mechanism of stacking long 3x1 tiles so that the upper tiles obscure some parts of the tiles underneath. In Rat Hot, the two players simply take turns to draw 2 tiles from a face down pile, and add them to the existing layout.&#10;&#10;The tiles are all 1x3 and show a combination of rats, spices or empty crates. Each player has four different types of spice in their player colour which they are trying to form into large groups. Many of the tiles have spices of both colours.&#10;&#10;The game is scored with grey and yellow chips which represent 1 and 2 points. Each time you place a tile, you and your opponent can score points from groups created or changed by that tile. Whenever a group of two of the same spice is formed, the owning player receives one point, or two points for groups of three or more. Beware! If there are three rats of your own colour visible at the end of your turn, you instantly lose.&#10;&#10;When the draw pile is exhausted and the tiles all placed, the board is scored once more for all players, so trying to preserve existing groups also counts.&#10;&#10;The real trick in the game comes in the tile placement. Tiles must be adjacent by at least one square. Tiles can placed on top of other tiles, so that stacks build up. But a tile can not sit exactly on top of another, so there must always be some offset, and all three squares of a tile must be supported by other tiles, or the table.&#10;&#10;Rat Hot can be very tricky. You want to keep your opponent's rats exposed in awkward places, so they have to spend both their moves trying to keep the rats covered. But you also want to set up scoring positions, and cover your own rats, and avoid giving your opponent points as well. There's a good mental challenge here, as you puzzle over the best use and arrangement of your tiles. Do you dare leave two of your rats open, because your opponent may draw more of your rats and make it impossible for you to finish your next turn with less than three showing. Can you get a good group of spices going and also break up your opponent's groups? Tricky problems for tricky minds.&#10;&#10;Rat Hot is a quick, fun game and is a good addition to Queen's line of small 2-player games. The wood chips make it easy to see who is leading, the tiles are nicely made, the graphics are fun, and the game plays quickly and fairly. You can be stuffed by unlucky tile draws, but perhaps your low score is more to do with your choices, or maybe the other player is just smarter than you. Fast play, easy rules, and the risk of sudden death give Rat Hot a high replay value.&#10;&#10;",

With green cubes you increase your ministers and potential to gain VPs at the end of a round. Yellow cubes attract warriors and permit you to hold more battle cards. The blue cubes are &quot;pipers&quot; used for combat support or possible VP generation. A blue cube can also be played as a &quot;bard&quot; to lure away opponents' followers. Finally, there are the red cubes, which represent cattle and generate VPs. You also use cubes to create new estates, where you can deposit cattle and groups of cubes (which are safer than those not on an estate).&#10;&#10;Raids are resolved simply. In three battle-rounds a card of value one to four is played by the two opponents; this value can be increased by a single blue cube. The one who wins the most battle-rounds wins the fight. The loser will then lose cubes while the victor gains a VP or two.&#10;&#10;After each round there is a valuation, in which the VPs are determined based on number of cubes. For example, the player with the most green cubes gets 3 VPs, while second most gets 2 VPs; if two players are tied for most, each gets only 1 VP. Another example: each red cattle tile is worth a VP, but if one player has the most he gets a 2 VP bonus.&#10;&#10;The estate tiles contain a number on the back. After each round a panel is turned. If the leading player has at least as many points as the number of the tile, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Bottom line: a fast game offering something for everyone: luck, tactics, and lots of interaction with your fellow players.&#10;&#10;",

Play dominoes on their corresponding spaces on the game board. As you complete squares, you conquer territories and claim them as your own. Dominate the game board and you win! For ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;From a review in &quot;Games Quarterly&quot;, Winter 2005:&#10;&#10;The Domination board is a seven-by-seven grid of squares with sets of numbers that resemble half a domino at each corner. Each player starts with seven dominoes. When it's your turn, you lay down a domino along one edge of a square so that the numbers on both corners match your domino. Then you draw another domino.&#10;&#10;If your play closes off the fourth side of a square, you put a poker chip in the center of that square to claim it. You keep playing until all the dominoes are used, which fills up the entire board. At that point, the player with the most chips on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

There are 140 &ldquo;long&rdquo; playing pieces, depicting the major fleet units of both sides: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and fleet destroyers. There are also 280 square playing pieces, half the size of the ship pieces, mostly depicting aircraft but also smaller warships and markers.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two operational maps, covering the South China Sea and the East Indies, and these maps overlap with the maps in the &quot;Eastern Fleet&quot; product.&#10;&#10;As with all &quot;Great War at Sea&quot;/&quot;Second World War at Sea&quot; games, the tactical map is a generic field of blue hexagons that ships and aircraft move to when fleets meet on the operational maps.  Combat is simple - roll 1d6 for every 'factor' the ship has, with a result of '6' equaling a hit.  Compare the weapon that hit (primary gun, secondary gun, tertiary gun, torpedo, or bomb) vs the armor of the area hit to determine if penetration occurred.  If it did, mark off a damage box.&#10;&#10;&quot;Strike South&quot; includes 15 scenarios, of which 8 of these are limited &quot;Battle Scenarios&quot;, that just use the tactical map.  The larger 'Operational Scenarios' can take some time to play out - sometimes a whole evening, although Avalanche Press tries to focus them on a 2-hr timeframe - and include such actions as the last mission of the British Battleship Prince of Wales, the Battle of the Java Sea, the Battle of Sunda Strait, and the Japanese invasion of the Philipines.&#10;&#10;Strike South includes: &#10;&#10;     Two 32&quot;x22&quot; strategic maps &#10;     11&quot;x17&quot; tactical map &#10;     420 game pieces &#10;     12-page rulebook &#10;     12-page scenario book &#10;     2 player aid cards &#10;     1 organizational card &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",
