For the first time in history, air power will decide the fate of a nation.&#10;&#10;August 1940: The Royal Air Force has been awaiting massive German air raids since Churchill refused to make peace with Germany. And they did not have to wait long - in fact, far too short to build up the RAF to a strength that would be able to match the German Luftwaffe. But besides its fighters, the RAF has other weapons to help deal with the &quot;Huns&quot;: a chain of RDF (radar) towers along the British coast, and an elaborate system of communications, signal evaluation and fighter control and guidance. If those are used skilfully, the resulting economy of Fighter Command operations might just be able to offset the sheer power of the German Luftflotten (&quot;air fleets&quot;).&#10;&#10;You are in command of all four RAF Fighter Groups to match them against the incoming raids. Can you deny the Luftwaffe its objective to weaken the British air defence system beyond the breaking point?&#10;&#10;",

The races are paired up as Coral Elf/Lava Elf, Dwarf/Goblin, Feral/Undead, and Amazon/Swamp Stalker. Hybrid Dragons were offered in 2008. Acolytes of the Eldarim (a large expansion of the Eldarim race) was released in August 2009, along with a re-release of the Dragonkin. The Battlefields expansion (new major and minor terrains) was released in August 2010, adding exciting new options and strategies. The Dragoncrusader and Dragonzealots (new Eldarim Champions) were released in 2011. Dwarves and Goblins were re-released as kickers in 2012 and now include a 5th monster for each race.

        "name": "Dragonfire",
        "description": "Dragonfire was an attempt by Target/Heartbreaker to entice young adults into roleplaying, by means of devising a crossover between a roleplaying game and a fantasy miniatures boardgame similar to Milton Bradley and Games Workshop with their Hero Quest game system. This boxed game consists of 16 miniatures, various room and corridor tiles, cardboard doors with stand-ups, and some dungeon dressings represented by die cut cardboard pieces. The aim is to complete the task of each scenario given in the scenario booklet. One player is the Dungeon Master and sets up the rooms and monsters within when the other players reach them; the instructions are very specific about how to place the monsters, traps or items they encounter. Players are cooperative and do not compete against each other. Of course the players won't see the adventure booklet in advance or during the game, only the game master. All the players are knights of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). The same four colors are used for the plastic miniatures of: 4 orcs with bows, 4 trolls with clubs, and 4 Dragon Lords with swords.&#10;Between each scenario may the players increase their rank, depending on how many points they have collected during the scenario. They get points depending on which monsters they have killed plus one extra for a successfully done scenario. In the Dungeons are there monsters, traps, magic items and other stuff. Overall, the designers do a decent job of making the scenarios entertaining given a limited amount material in the game. Each turn, a new event card is overturned and strange things take place. This is fun at first but becomes predictable in later games.&#10;The dicing and combat system uses colored dice with different probabilities of scoring a hit - similar to Heroquest's Skulls and shields except that they are just circles on the dice and represent more of a yes/no answer when rolling. The game is slightly more advanced than Heroquest in that players can advance in levels similar to dungeons and dragons. As you increase in levels, you switch color of dice when attacking and defending, thus increasing your chances to score a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;hit&quot; result on the dice. Otherwise the game is very similar to HeroQuest in general.&#10;Heartbreaker Hobbies produced a couple of lead elf miniatures designed for use with Dragonfire. At the same time, they put out a rare poster/magazine called &quot;Symmetry&quot; #1 that included two new magic items for the game, stats for two elf characters, and a short scenario using all of this with the Dragonfire game. One would assume that consumer response was lacking given that no attention was given to the Dragonfire game in later issues of Symmetry and the game went into obscurity. Still, the game could be used for a couple of night's gaming, especially if introducing children to D&amp;D style gaming or if one wanted to pirate the minis and room pieces to use with other game systems.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Component Game Systems came out with a number of component game systems that used the same sort-of-collectible approach (a roughly similar game is Space Race). Besides Babylon 5, there was Hercules, Xena, and Star Trek. The Babylon 5 game was apparently derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name --Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process.&#10;&#10;The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and put their components in common to have a game. Pretty cool.&#10;&#10;In the Babylon 5 game, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.&#10;&#10;You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are &#10;different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs. You can create decks for each player as per CCGs, or you can just draw from a common deck after handing out the empire specific cards.&#10;&#10;Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.&#10;&#10;The game does a very good job of recreating the B5 universe, with play action matching pretty closely the series' happenings. In terms of mechanics, it is similar to Twilight Imperium and Les Cochons de l'espace.&#10;&#10;There are two core sets, although CGS initially intended five (one for each of the show's seasons). They are the 2258 and 2259 Core Sets. The first was published in two formats, the 1997 first printing (Limited Edition; CB5-101) using a smaller, unimpressive box (they were in a hurry to get it to the store shelves by Christmas of that year), whilst the 1998 second printing (CB5-001) came in a beautiful large box (allowing room for the storage of extra sets) labeled as &quot;Babylon 5: The Board Game&quot;. The 2259 Core Set (CB5-102) was only published in the big box format. The core sets include the Earth Alliance, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic and Minbari factions, which were each available separately (although the core sets include some extra cards and stuff beyond the combination of the four individual Starter Kits). There is supposedly enough difference between the 2258 and 2259 core sets to warrant buying both, although I haven't received my 2259 set yet so I can't be sure.&#10;&#10;Component Game Systems has now disappeared from the face of the earth, and even their domain name (www.c-g-s.com) has been recycled by some unrelated outfit.&#10;&#10;Part of the Component Game System.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn you must play to the central &quot;Pig Pile&quot; one or more cards of the same value that are equal to or greater than the top card of the Pig Pile. If you fail to do so, you must take the entire Pig Pile into your hand. Certain cards have special effects:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hog Wild: Wild card that can be played at any time and allows any card to played on it next turn.&#10;    Hog Tied (4s): The next player loses his turn.&#10;    Hog Wash (8s): Remove the Pig Pile from the game and take another turn. (If three cards of the same value are played in succession, a Hog Wash takes place automatically.)&#10;    Ewe Turn (11s): Reverse order of play.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each turn you draw back to three cards until the deck runs out. If you have no cards in hand (which can happen only after the deck runs out), you must play a face-up card (a card that you laid aside at start) or if those are gone, a slop card. (Slop cards are played blind, so you could be really screwed.) If you're the first or second player to rid yourself of cards (including your slop), you receive a number of pigs.

Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.&#10;&#10;The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.&#10;&#10;Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say &quot;I'm a Crab player&quot; you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.&#10;&#10;L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.&#10;&#10;The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: &#10;&#10;     Clan War, a miniatures game.&#10;     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.&#10;     Legend of the Five Rings: Art of War, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.&#10;     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.&#10;&#10;In 2008, L5R held the first &quot;Mega-Game&quot; which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.&#10;&#10;In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.&#10;&#10;Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.&#10;&#10;In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.&#10;&#10;2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.&#10;&#10;In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017. FFG has also plans to continue the RPG at some point (in what form and with which ruleset is yet unknown).&#10;&#10;",

While the game retained some of the features of the original game, it also removed a number of abilities and interactions deemed too confusing for the novice player.  Though a number of the cards in portal were direct counterparts to cards in the regular-run of Magic: the Gathering, gone were named abilities like Trample, Banding, -walk (though Three Kingdoms did add the ability &quot;Horsemanship&quot;, which is almost but not quite flying).  Additionally, the game cut back on cards that could be played on another player's turn (i.e. instants and interrupts), leading to a greater focus on creatures and not spell interactions to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Portal cards are recognizable from core and expansion sets of Magic: the Gathering by the expansion symbol, as well as a bolder and larger font in the text box, and symbols next to the attack and defense numbers of creatures.&#10;&#10;Portal was printed in three editions:&#10;&#10;     Portal&#10;     Portal Second Age&#10;     Portal Three Kingdoms (with an Eastern/Chinese theme)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

As such, GMT's War Galley is almost a complete history for this era of war at sea.&#10;&#10;What is best about War Galley is how easy it is to play -- the rules are about half the length of the usual GBoH game -- and that means that most battles can be complete in several hours, at the most. The battles themselves, cover all aspects of galley tactics, from the line against line of big ships at Salamis (Cyprus), to the Chase, Turn and Fight of Chios, to the Line Astern vs. Line Abreast at Side, to probably the most unusual of all ancient battles, the Roman arrowhead against the Carthaginian Lines Astern at Drepanum in 249 B.C.&#10;&#10;War Galley wars and battles covered by the scenarios are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ionian Revolt- Lade, 494 BC&#10;     Peloponnesian War- Arginusae, 406 BC&#10;     The Silician Wars- Catana, 397 BC&#10;     The First Successor War- Salamis, 306 BC (Cyprus)&#10;     The First Punic War&#10;         Ecnomus, 256 BC&#10;         Drepanum, 249 BC&#10;         Aegatian Islands, 242 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Macedonian Wars- Chios, 201 BC&#10;     The War with Antiochus&#10;         Side, 190 BC&#10;         Myonessus, 190 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Civil War&#10;         Tauris, 47 BC&#10;         Naulochus, 36 BC&#10;         Actium, 31 BC &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.&#10;&#10;From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.  The second set of money (dollars) is thus actually a victory point counting device and not actual currency (i.e. it cannot be spent).&#10;&#10;It works well with any number of players (when playing with a smaller complement, each player operates multiple mines) except five, as the competition factor on one side of the board is uneven with the other.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details.

Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).&#10;&#10;Competitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!&#10;&#10;The game was first published as &quot;Choice&quot; because Anspach was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot; by the courts. When that was overturned in 1983, the name was changed to &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot;. In 1987, believing that consumer confusion between Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II was harming sales of the latter game, Anspach ceased the production of the original game and removed the &quot;II&quot; from the name of the latter game.&#10;&#10;",

If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country.&#10;&#10;You start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country's port to your country. To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces. Secret agents also move each turn and are used to defend attacks by blocking the path of opposing leaders and for moving onto &quot;?&quot; spaces to take a gamble on an incident card. At face value, half the cards are favourable and half not, but all offer diplomatic opportunities for the country who is most stable.&#10;&#10;To survive players must continually manage risks while trying to maximize their oil revenue.

Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;&#10;&#10;Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.&#10;&#10;The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.&#10;&#10;Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.&#10;&#10;There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.&#10;&#10;The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.&#10;&#10;Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.&#10;&#10;Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.&#10;&#10;The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.&#10;&#10;A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.&#10;&#10;The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.&#10;&#10;Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.&#10;&#10;from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles.

Alternatively, the game can be timed and scored.&#10;&#10;You start with a small number of provinces under your control.  Population counters of your colour indicate this; if a province has extra population, it can move some into an adjacent unoccupied province --this is the simplest way of conquest.  Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.&#10;&#10;A player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.  If the second player agrees then the smaller empire is absorbed by the larger and both players continue play as senior (larger) and junior (smaller) partners.  The absorbed empire no longer has a separate turn nor separate recruitment.  This concept of &quot;shared victory&quot; is intriguing, particularly with a larger number of players.&#10;&#10;The game allows any number of players but components are only provided for five.&#10;&#10;",

The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.&#10;&#10;Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.&#10;&#10;Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.&#10;&#10;The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:&#10;&#10;The Eye (covers 1 square);&#10;    The Rod (covers 2 squares);&#10;    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);&#10;    The Snake (covers 4 squares);&#10;    The Door (covers 5 squares);&#10;    The Gun (covers 6 squares).&#10;&#10;",

Thus, each move is chosen to try and limit your opponent's next as well as to try and guarantee yourself a good selection of choices.

Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.&#10;&#10;Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.&#10;&#10;Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The Gameboard is big and beautiful. It has large areas denoting the nations of the Middle East, with some abstracted land to shore up the U.A.E. and some islands. It also has oil wells and airbases, as well as some other stuff.&#10;&#10;The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!&#10;&#10;Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.&#10;&#10;Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.&#10;&#10;All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.&#10;&#10;A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.&#10;&#10;",

The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.&#10;&#10;The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.&#10;&#10;Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.&#10;&#10;The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.&#10;&#10;It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;. It's a hoot whether you're winning or losing.&#10;&#10;",

As commander of the U.S. or Soviet fleet and respective allies, you must form your ships into Task Forces  and attempt to cripple the enemy&rsquo;s capital ships and submarines.  Your limited air assets must be carefully assigned to defensive and offensive missions.  Commando, parachute and amphibious assault units stand at the ready to capture vital objectives.  Most important, you must protect your supply and replenishment ships, or your fleet will be unable to maintain combat momentum.  Sixth Fleet is a comprehensive simulation of the myriad elements involved in future naval confrontation.&#10;&#10;Each 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.&#10;Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.&#10;Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.&#10;About 14 scenarios are included which range from about 60 minutes (for Introductory Scenarios) to 3 to 6 hours (for Intermediate Scenarios) to 20 or more hours (for the Advanced Scenarios).&#10;&#10;Part of Victory Games Fleet Series.&#10;&#10;",
