From shore to shore, all owe thanks to his wondrous legacy. Now, sacred sites across the land have been defiled and plundered by the disgraced wizard Mortibris, who along with his vile undead minions will stop at nothing to obtain the secrets of Valandor&rsquo;s power. Only the bravest heroes dare oppose him. Thrown together from the far corners of the realm, they step boldly into the depths, ready to face whatever foul evil awaits them&hellip;&#10;&#10;Hero, your quest begins here!&#10;&#10;Embark on a fantasy adventure for up to five players with Dungeon Saga: Dwarf King's Quest. With highly detailed game-pieces and learn-as-you-play rules, this set contains everything you need to transform your tabletop into a deep and immersive world of heroes and monsters. Play a single game in just 30 minutes, or combine the carefully composed adventures for countless hours of classic quest gameplay. When the fate of the world hangs in the balance, which part will you play in the epic Dungeon Saga?&#10;&nbsp;&#10;-Epic, story-driven campaign&#10;-Classic quest atmosphere&#10;-Easy rules you can learn as you play&#10;-Characters that develop as the adventure unfolds&#10;-Beautifully illustrated 3D dungeons with doors, barrels, bookcases and more!&#10;-26 detailed and fully assembled miniatures in coloured plastic&#10;-Evocative &lsquo;ancient tome&rsquo; packaging in a protective sleeve&#10;&#10;One player takes the part of the evil dungeon overlord with the forces of evil at his command, and the others divide the mighty heroes between them.&nbsp;Each hero has strengths and weaknesses and teamwork is the key: The mighty barbarian can slaughter many foes at a time, yet he is lightly armoured and vulnerable to strong enemies. The Dwarf, on the other hand, is steadier as his thick armour can resist most attacks. The Elf is not as skilled a fighter as either of these, instead preferring to stay at a distance where her finely-honed archery skills can best be used. Finally, there is the wizard -the others may laugh at his lack of fighting skill, yet it is often his magic that carries the day. If the others can keep him alive, that is.&#10;&#10;This core set will be supported with a raft of expansion products as time goes on, adding new challenges and game modes to your Dungeon Saga. The first of these will be Adventurer's Companion which will add an AI system for solo and fully co-operative play, the ability to create unique characters from scratch using any model in your collection, the tools you need to design your own dungeons and much more!&#10;&#10;",

When one player has rid himself of all of the cards (quests) in his hand, or when a certain period of time has passed (when you've drawn four special cards from the draw deck), that round ends. The player who rid himself of cards gets closer to the High Heavens, but those with cards remaining are pushed away even further.&#10;&#10;The gods can also use their faithful servants for their own purposes. They can help their masters to do away with surplus quests, or cause trouble for the other gods by imposing more quests on them. However, take care when you do this because all such acts remain in memory as bad karma. If you manage to complete all of your quests, your accumulated bad karma will be ignored, but if you fail and have quests remaining, they will become a heavy burden.&#10;&#10;You will need to determine when to silently do your chores and when to use your servants to increase your chances of success.&#10;&#10;",

The person with the smallest feet starts first. A player wins a round when she has the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. To find the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella, each player lays down a card. The card dictates which card will be or won't be the real Cinderella. When a card is laid down, everyone secretly votes whether or not they want the new rule for that round. This repeats until each player has played two cards. Then everyone reveals their hand, and whoever has the card that matches all the rules laid out in the round is the winner for having the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. In cases of ties, the winner is the player with the highest card.&#10;&#10;Game #3 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.&#10;&#10;",

It's up to the citizens of the Miskatonic Valley to work together to wield its awful power to stop the end before it begins.&#10;&#10;In Shadow of the Elder Gods, 1-4 players take on the roles of citizens of Arkham who work together to prevent cosmic horrors from unraveling reality. Shadow focuses on dealing with the consequences of dark forces conspiring against players, rather than combat. Players take turns spending actions to travel the streets of Arkham researching Knowledge, hiring Muscle, collecting Assets, and dealing with Threats.&#10;&#10;Each game revolves around an inevitable danger to Arkham which is represented by the Threat Deck, a constructed deck of cards which players must survive in order to banish the Elder Threat and win the game. Each threat card features an Arkham face and a Shadow face. The Arkham faces represents the visible manifestations of the unseemly things found on the Shadow faces of the cards. Whenever the player with the Threat Start Marker begins their turn, a Threat token is placed on the current Threat Card and the indicated damage is dealt to players or locations. The first/last card represents the unique Elder Threat which players must contend with in order to win.&#10;&#10;The player who possesses the Ring of Shadows is able to view the Shadow side of the Threat Deck and deal with the Threat at hand by using what resources they have, but they expose themselves and others to harm in the process. If players manage to survive their final encounter with the Elder Threat in the shadows, they unceremoniously save the world from incomprehensible danger.

Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.&#10;&#10;Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.&#10;&#10;Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.&#10;&#10;In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed. During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round. You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom.&#10;&#10;Each player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor&rsquo;s favors. Careful, though, because trying to get too much power, or exploiting the workers for personal gain could increase dissatisfaction among the populace, and consequently increase the risk of uprisings in the newly added kingdoms. Whoever is able to make the greatest contribution to the emperor's cause, while at the same time keeping the citizens placid, will be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Whether you seek to triumph through military might, or use diplomacy to achieve your ends, the fate of the galaxy rests in your hands.&#10;&#10;On one side of this galactic battleground are the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. Only rarely can these heroes go toe to toe with the unlimited reserves of the Imperial Navy and Army. Instead, the iconic characters of Star Wars and the unsung heroes of the Rebellion must work in secret, utilizing diplomacy, reconnaissance, and the Force to achieve their aims. Even when the Rebellion deploys its full military strength to win a battle or destroy a key Imperial emplacement, they need the groundwork put in place by Alliance Special Forces.&#10;&#10;Opposing the heroic endeavors of the Rebel Alliance is the massive power of the Empire, led by the twisted Emperor. The dark side of the Force is strong with the Emperor and Darth Vader, and the military might of the Empire is unparalleled across the galaxy. Whether you undertake aggressive negotiations or hire bounty hunters and scum to ferret out Rebel spies, making the Empire the ultimate power in the galaxy rests in your hands.&#10;&#10;To successfully win these struggles and reclaim the galaxy in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, you will need to utilize all of your resources. Every turn, you can increase your faction&rsquo;s presence at the current event by drawing the top card from your deck and putting it into play. Each resource card you play give you more power and brings you closer to the objective value of the current event. As an example, the resource card shown to the right has a resource value of five, which it contributes to your total resource value while in play.

Each building has four characteristics &mdash; carpentry, masonry, architecture, painting &mdash; rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building, but placing a worker on a construction site costs money.&#10;&#10;Each turn players have three free actions; however, for an added cost players may also chose to buy additional actions during their turn. Unlike in The Builders: Middle Ages, players can acquire slaves and put them to work, but if they don't pay to free the slaves by the end of the game, they lose points. Other changes from the original game include the ability to send your workers to universities or purchase tools to improve their characteristics.&#10;&#10;Make use of your workers, of your slaves, or your freed slaves to build your buildings and amass victory points to ultimately be named the greatest builder of all!&#10;&#10;",

In this game you play the role of one of the crew members on board the space ship Liberty. Your job as a Mover is to jump from planet to planet in the system picking up and delivering cargo. Movers specialize in getting cargo to its destination as efficiently as possible. As you deliver cargo, you are rewarded with resources that are needed to keep the Liberty flying. But you must do this without drawing too much attention from the Universal Oversight.&#10;&#10;Universal Oversight (UO) is the government elected by the planets to police the system. The UO watches all movement through the system in an attempt to keep order. Over time it has become corrupt and evil. UO Scouts are sometimes dispatched to chase down and interrogate Movers that have been spotted delivering cargo. They are looking to confiscate anything that might be a threat to the UO&rsquo;s power. If you draw the eye of the UO too often, your job will eventually become impossible. You and your fellow players must work together to deliver cargo, avoid UO Scouts and quickly handle any Events that pop up along the way.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you need to complete a set of five Objective Cards. These cards directly continue the story that begins in the included graphic novel Finding Liberty. (A 20-card random objective card deck will also be included with the game. Players can choose 5 cards from this deck for a fresh experience each game)&#10;&#10;- Unique Dice-Rolling Mechanic&#10;How the dice are rolled-Space Movers handles dice-rolling to complete skill checks in a whole new way. Rolls take place inside the game box on a specially designed roll board. Dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once. For each skill needed in the check, 1 die will be rolled needing a 5 or higher for success. Since the dice are rolled 1 at a time into the box, players are encouraged to strike dice already rolled in an attempt to change the result as needed. After all the dice are rolled, one last roll is made using the blank 6 sided die. This signals the end of the skill check and is a player&rsquo;s last attempt to change any previous die results.&#10;&#10;- Comic Book Included&#10;The story begins in the Comic book &ldquo;Finding Liberty&rdquo; that will be included with the game.

Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.&#10;&#10;First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.&#10;&#10;Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.&#10;&#10;Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?&#10;&#10;In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?&#10;&#10;",

You hire monsters, build rooms, buy traps and defeat the do-gooders who wish to bring you down. Each turn, players use a hand of cards to choose where to place their worker imps. Actions vary from mining gold, hiring monsters, buying traps etc. Each action has three spots available - with each spot having different effects (e.g., mining gold lets you mine more gold in each spot). When using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn.&#10;&#10;The entire game lasts two &quot;game years&quot;, and each year consists of four seasons (a.k.a. turns). At the start of each season, players see the heroes and events to come in the following season, allowing them to prepare. At the end of each season after the first, heroes are allocated to each player according to the players' level of evilness. Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves. Each hero has its own power for which the player needs to prepare for.

Through clever pairing of colored and numbered cards, players can summon dangerous Monster Cards to their aid, unlock the eldritch secrets of lost Artifact Cards, and even manipulate an Unspeakable Guardian to terrorize your opponent. All of this and more await the cunning and adventurous in this tactical card game of influence and horror for 2 players.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will have 2 actions: you can either draw 2 cards, play 2 cards from your hand, or draw a card and play a card. Cards can be drawn from a face down deck of Cultist cards or a face up pile of discarded Cultists cards, known as the Valley. Cards must be played on your side of one of the four main Lovecraftian locations - Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport. The player with the most total points on a given location turns the location to face them, marking that location as being influenced by their cultists. As the values change during gameplay, locations will shift their influence from player to player. Playing three of the same color, three of the same number, or a run of three cards of the same color (ex. 2-3-4 of green) will earn players the right to draw from special Monster and Artifact cards to help their hold on locations or hinder their opponent. At key points in the game, Old Ones will be drawn from the Cultist Deck and attach themselves to a location: the player currently influencing that location will reap the benefits of the Old One.

This edition has an error on the board that has the name of the game covering part of the graphics and text on the board.&#10;&#10;Kremlin is played for up to ten turns, ending as soon as the Party Chief successfully waves three times at the May Day Parade or when so many politicians are dead or in Siberia that the Party Chief can disband the Politburo and take complete power for himself.&#10;&#10;Each turn has phases.  The most important of these are the KGB trials (which can send party members to Siberia or the cemetery) and the Defense Ministry's Spy Investigations which can also force politicians on a winter's gulag holiday.  With the KGB, the catch is that the higher up the ladder the target, the more difficult to bring down, and Party Chief's tend to change KGB leaders who take shots at the top...  For the Defense Minister, his investigations require a trial to be successful--and a guilty vote, and that isn't always possible in the Central Committee.&#10;&#10;The catch?  Players allot influence secretly at the start of the game and don't reveal it until it is used, meaning no one knows who controls the KGB or any other ministry, not until Influence is revealed--and even then, who knows who still has undeclared influence on that person?  It is possible that players can swap control back and forth over the KGB chief even as he is trying to determine who to assassinate!&#10;&#10;Once the carnage is done, players have to survive the ravages of aging--and every time a politician takes action, he ages faster than normal...your 50 yr old star of the party?  Well, suddenly he's acting like he's 83, Comrade.  Life near the top will do that to you.  In the Health phase, politicians may die or grow sick--sick politicians can choose to go to the hospital, but while there, they exert no influence and their responsibilities pass on to other politicians. Sometimes this means your man must make the heroic sacrifice to the Rodina and remain on the job even while at death's door.&#10;&#10;Once we know who is still alive, the Party Chief is allowed to move politicians between posts.  After all, he's in control of the bureaucracy.  He can move people up and down, and when he's done, upper ministers do so as well--but can only affect politicians below them on the food chain.  Heck, politicians can even sponsor comrades in exile in Siberia to come back to the People.  Of course, each person you bring back ages you five years....want to bring back five?

It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution.

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components.

You then refill your hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when all the barbarian villages on the game board have been surrounded and attacked or when all the temples have been constructed.

Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.&#10;&#10;A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel. Shops score according to how many houses are currently connected to the shop. There are also bonuses awarded to the first player who connects a shop to a certain number of houses.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player completes the highest possible hotel or shop score, or when a player loses his last tree due to pollution.
