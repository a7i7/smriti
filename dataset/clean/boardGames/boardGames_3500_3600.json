But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn.

Before each phase, horses are auctioned off to the players; each player gets 2, 4 or 6 horses depending on the number of players. After each phase, players can keep only one horse from the preceding phases, the rest are auctioned off again. Auction is followed by training which is played on a short &quot;training track&quot; on the game board; here the horses can get better - each horse has a value from -5 to +5 which will help/hinder in the roll-and-move race - and the players may also get cards for later use during the actual race.&#10;&#10;Results of the training define starting positions for the race and also give some clue as to each horse's capabilities, so now it's time for betting. A player can bet on up to 2-3 horses, depending on the number of players; betting is secret, and a player can freely bet on any horses, including their opponents'.&#10;&#10;The actual race is conducted as roll-and-move using 2 dice. A special die is used for moving the horses, adding or subtracting their individual modifiers, and a regular d6 is used to determine if a player must pick a race card (on 1 or 6). These affect the race directly and often quite drastically; some may be saved for later use.&#10;&#10;After the race the winning horse gets it's modifier increased by one step, all bets are revealed, money paid out from the bank and preparations made for the next race. Horses that competed in a race may not compete in the immediate next one - this is why the players have several. After the 2nd and 4th races, the auction phase is repeated.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, a bonus is paid to players who managed to bet on the winning horse in 5 or 6 races, any bank loans are paid back, and winner is the player with most money.&#10;&#10;Approximate play sequence:&#10;&#10;1) Auction - buy a number of horses&#10;2) Train them for the race&#10;3) Select horses for race 1&#10;4) Betting phase&#10;5) Run short race&#10;6) Pay winner, both race and betting money.&#10;7) Repeat 3-6, but with long race&#10;8) repeat 1-6 twice&#10;9) Pay bonus to anyone who has picked the winner in at least 5 of the 6 races.&#10;&#10;",

Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.&#10;&#10;From the designer:&#10;Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution.

Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from her rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, she scores one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, she immediately takes another turn. At the end of her turn, she refills her rack to six tiles. (Before refilling her rack, if she has no tiles on it that contain hexes in her lowest-scoring color, she can discard all of her tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&#10;&#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&#10;&#10;Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see his partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.&#10;&#10;",

And with La Strada, he has come up with a particularly clever road-building game. Everything &ndash; from the rules to the game play &ndash; is devilishly simple. The game lets players claim successes throughout the game, and turn-by-turn one reaches one or even multiple goals. But at the end, someone else wins? How did that happen?&#10;&#10;The game features a variable game board, built up out of hex tiles that depict easily traveled flatland, forests, or hills. Before the start of the game, nineteen different settlements (ranging from cities to tiny villages) with varying victory point values are randomly placed onto those spaces featuring a gray symbol. Each player then places his or her starting marker onto a chosen flatland tile. The object here is of course to try to put your starting marker near as many high-value cities as possible.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to connect together as many settlements with your roads as possible, in order to get as many victory points as possible. The catch is that settlements award fewer and fewer victory points the more players connect to them. The cities are like pies: the more people want a slice, the smaller the slices have to be.&#10;&#10;Building streets is very simple. One a player&rsquo;s turn, he receives six gold pieces. Each street segment costs two gold to build over flatland, three over forest, and four over hills. Players can build as many segments as they can afford on their turn, provided that they end at a settlement and don&rsquo;t intersect any other streets on the way. Put simply: players can&rsquo;t end a street in the middle of nowhere and then keep building next turn. Streets have to reach their destination at the end of each turn.&#10;&#10;Once a settlement has been reached, and then the player gets to put one of their trade markers on it. Note that streets can intersect each other only at the settlement locations. If a player doesn&rsquo;t use up all of his gold on his turn, then he can save it for the next turn (where he will also get another six gold to play with again). Players aren&rsquo;t allowed to spend more than ten gold pieces on their turn, though, so you can&rsquo;t save forever.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player can&rsquo;t build any more roads or doesn&rsquo;t have any trade markers left.&#10;&#10;Scoring then occurs. A scoring example for a city: The city is worth five victory points, but only if it was connected to by a single player. A doubly connected city is worth four points for each player, while a triply connected city is only worth three each. Cities connected to by four players are only worth two points. This decreasing point system also counts for smaller settlements, worth between four and two victory points. A nicely thought out sorting system ensures that the end game scoring doesn&rsquo;t turn into a math exercise. Naturally, the player with the most victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie, then the tied player with the most gold left is the winner.&#10;&#10;La Strada is a very simple game: build roads and connect cities. But it&rsquo;s not that easy to get ahead with the scores. It&rsquo;s every player&rsquo;s dream to claim a fat five point city all to themselves &ndash; but a player who spends too much energy trying to protect an investment will find that his other road-building options become tighter.&#10;&#10;[Text is from a preview by Spielbox]&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Theme:&#10;&#10;Game is themed around a purification ritual of the ancient Etruscan people, who predated the Roman Empire around 6th century B.C.  Each player represents a different temple, faithful to the divinities Achvizr, Alpan, Leinth, and Thalna.  On &quot;Tagete's&quot; day, the Etruscan Haruspexes [priests] proceed down the path of purification to the Velthumena Altar.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;Each player has 8 pawns representing &quot;Haruspexes&quot; [priests] in their color.  Each player is trying to move their priests along the path of purifiction from their home temple to the altar at the center of the board.  One player may also choose the path of darkness and consecrate themselves to the divinity &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; with the goal of elminating all rival priests.  This role is only available in 3 and 4 player games.  If a player chooses this path, then another single player may consecrate themselves to &quot;Lasa Vecuvia&quot; with a different set of powers.  This player's goal is to now move their priests to set &quot;passages&quot; on the path and place 4 seals to win the game.  This role is only available in 4 player games.&#10;&#10;Players win by having the most priests in the center altar at game end.  If a player chooses Tuchulcha's power, they win by eliminating all other priests, and lose if any priest enters the altar.  A player that chooses the Lasa Vecuvia power wins only by placing all 4 seals.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Game plays with 2, 3, or 4 players. Each player begins the game with 8 pawns on their home temple.  On their turn players roll 2 dice.  If doubles are rolled, the player may throw a third die.  Then player chooses to move one or more of their pawns the number of pips shown on each die.  For example, if a 5 and a 2 are rolled, a player may move one pawn 5 and another 2, or one pawn 5, and then 2 [not seven at once].  This is important as where you land can be significant on each move.  Players move their pawns around a spiral path approaching the altar at the center.  Along the way players will encounter other players' pawns, and special spaces on the path.  These spaces can increase the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of players' pieces by two times of three times [Mystical Stones], or &quot;passage&quot; spaces can banish them to the Tuchulcha forest.  While Mystical Stone spaces are powerful in defense, pawns must move off these spaces as soon as they can.  Pawns can normally pass through each other regardless of owner.  Any number of a single player's pawns may occupy a single space.  However, when a pawn would land on another player's by exact count, it must equal the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of the player's pieces in the space.  Normally, spiritual strenght is one per pawn, but in the 2x or 3x spaces these are multiplied respectively.  If a moving player can eqaul the spiritual strength of pawns in the space, then the occupying pawns are banished to the Tuchulcha forest.  These pawns are essentially out of the game, but can be used to activate the alternate &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; player role. Once a pawn banishes an opponent's pawn, it may not move again this turn.  2 player game uses 2 &quot;neutral&quot; colors which any player can move during their turn.  3 player game adds the optional Tuchulcha player role, and 4 player adds both Tuchulcha and Lasa Vecuvia roles to play.&#10;&#10;At any time one and only one player [in 3 and 4 player games], may choose to take on the role of Tuchulcha [a god of destruction]. To activate this power, the player must &quot;sacrifice&quot; 3 pawns.  These pawns may come from the home temple, altar, path, or Tuchulcha forest.  Once activated, the Tuchulcha player's new objective is to eliminate all other players' pawns.  As soon as one other player's pawn enters the altar, Tuchulcha loses and is eliminated from the game.  This can make this role selection a risky move.  However, this player gains powerful new abilities. Tuchulcha's pawns can never be banished to the forest, he rolls 4 dice and selects the 3 best, and no longer has to stop after banishing an opponent's pawn.&#10;&#10;If a player chooses to be Tuchulcha in a 4 player game, then another [and only one] player may take the role of Lasa Vecuvia.  This player must still have 4 active pawns in play to activate.  This player's objectives are now to &quot;seal&quot; the 4 passages along the path.  These passages normally banish pawns to the forest, but when the Lasa player lands a pawn on the passage, she places a seal token on the passage and removes the pawn from play.  Once she places all four seals in this manner she wins the game.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;32 high quality wooden pawns in 4 colors&#10;4 green wooden dice with gold pips and rounded corners&#10;1 double sided game board for 3 and 4 player games&#10;1 full color illustrated rules booklet&#10;&#10;",

Fighting had broken out early that morning. Meade had shifted the assorted corps of the Army of the Potomac northward to that town. General Reynolds was reported down. Hancock had the field in hand (he hoped) and Meade was now moving his headquarters to that fateful field. In the few days since being thrust into command of the Army of the Potomac, Meade had gained full control and would now direct it toward what was to be its single most important battle.&#10;&#10;Turning back R.E. Lee's second invasion of the North, Meade would end the Southern general's significant offensive capabilities. For the North. it was the beginning of the march which would eventually win the war.&#10;&#10;David Powell has completely revised his earlier Thunder at the Crossroads.
