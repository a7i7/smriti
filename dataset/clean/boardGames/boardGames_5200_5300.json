Hitler issued goals that ranged from the far oil fields to a city on the Volga by the name of Stalingrad, finally deciding not to decide and ordered the far flung Army Group to divide and go for both.&#10;&#10;Across endless steppe, in the blazing sun and freezing cold, the Axis legions advanced to the edge of Asia and the Caucasus mountains. Some of the oil fields, and most of the city were taken.&#10;&#10;Then the Red Army had its turn...&#10;&#10;Case Blue is a game that covers both the Axis advance (1941 and 1942) as well as the Soviet counterattacks (Nov 42 to Jan 43) and the German counteroffensive at Kharkov (Feb-March 1943) that ended the series of campaigns in the south. The game covers in great detail all the operations from October 1941 until May 1943 on a large play area extending from Voronezh almost to the Turkish border. The full scope and grandiose nature of these operations come to life here.&#10;&#10;Case Blue covers and replaces the 1994 award winning game Enemy at the Gates. Players get to encircle Stalingrad, run their pocket and relief attempts and the many operations that game covered.&#10;&#10;Case Blue is the 10th game in the award winning Operational Combat System and is the result of over 6 years of intensive research and testing. Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions (OK, there are a few very strange companies), making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work.&#10;&#10;Case Blue is designed to be played both separately or linked to the 2001 game Guderian's Blitzkrieg II. The monster linked game allows players to run operations on the entire Eastern Front (except for Leningrad) from the fall of 1941 until mid-1943.&#10;&#10;Multiple scenarios (one map to very large) allow play to be picked up at various key points in the campaign.&#10;&#10;If you want a serious look at these pivotal campaigns while having fun at the same time, this is the game for you.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the Operational Combat System finest hour, this game is huge.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: Half Week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Company to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Nine 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets (Maps A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K)&#10;One 14 x 22&quot; full-color mapsheet (Map E)&#10;Ten dual-side printed countersheets (2,660 1/2&quot; Unit counters)&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; Marker counters)&#10;One 48-page OCS v4.0 series rules booklet&#10;One 16-page Case Blue game rules booklet&#10;One 80-page Case Blue Scenario Book 1&#10;One 48-page Case Blue Scenario Book 2&#10;One 24-page Case Blue Axis Booklet&#10;One 24-page Case Blue Russian Booklet&#10;Two 4-page two-color OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Beowulf: The Movie Board Game is a reimplementation of Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms. It's also not to be confused with the same author's Beowulf: The Legend. It's an abstract strategy clothed in a theme based on the movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. The players' goal is to score the most victory points by clever tile and figurine placement on the board, composed of squares arranged in a grid. Its layout is changed, as the game is divided into three chapters that feature slightly different sets of tiles that can be drawn. Clever hand management (of tiles and figurines) is also important in the game, as some of them can be used only once throughout the entire game. Gameplay is as follows:&#10;&#10;1. On his or her turn, a player may either place a tile (which can be a negative or a positive number, feature a special power or not) or a figurine on the board. If the player wishes to place a tile, he/she can add one to his/her hand of two and place one of the three tiles. Special powers of these tiles may be: displace a figurine, swap a tile from the board from the one from a player's hand, block other tiles, increase the power of figurines in the same row/column, cancel positive numbers on tiles, swap two tiles on the board.&#10;&#10;2. By placing tiles and figurines, players will form rows and columns. After the board is full, the value of each figurine is calculated. Each figurine has a value of 1-4. This value is multiplied by the sum of values of all tiles from tiles that are in its row and column. Special powers of tiles may apply here (like the increasing of figurines' power or blocking). Players evaluate all their figurines on the board and gain points equal to their value.&#10;&#10;This game differs considerably from its predecessor (not all of these may apply to the third English edition by Fantasy Flight Games released in 2012):&#10;&#10;1. In Kingdoms, all three acts took place on the same board. Here, the board is two-sided, with three varying grids.&#10;2. There are more positive tiles than negative ones in this game, therefore situations when players lose points for their figurines are much less frequent.&#10;3. Here, a player manages a hand of three tiles. In Kingdoms, the players had no hand. Instead, he/she drew a single tile which had to be placed on the board.&#10;4. There are more tiles with special powers. More tiles can be swapped, even figurines can change their position, which didn't happen in Kingdoms.&#10;&#10;",

It started before the birth of Christ (B.C.) and lasted, in the East, until year 476 A.D. (anno domini) and, in the West, until 1453 A.D. Let us go back to year 140 D.C., when this Empire reached its greatest extension and dominated practically all Europe, part of Asia and northern Africa. Times that were not completely peaceful, for enemies threatened the borders of the empire and the conquered people insurrected against domination, seeking freedom. Go back in time with War: Roman Empire and feel the thrill of defending your borders and advancing your legions, conquering provinces of the roman world in 140 A.D.! Observe, though, that the political division of the provinces adopted in the board objectives to ease the game mechanics, and not portrait the reality of that age. All province and sea names are written in latin. Only the region names are in portuguese. Each players is dealt an objective, that will only be known by himself. The knowledge of this objective by other players will make your conquest harder.

        "description": "This game covers the French insurgency war against FLN in Algeria during 1954-62. It is a conflict of great drama. It cost the lives of at least half a million Algerians, it brought the tumultuous exodus of one million French settlers from Algeria and it brought France itself to the brink of civil war. But to be portrayed as a game has its difficulties, though. How do you recreate the fact that the side which lost militarily won the war? How do you make it interesting to play when FLN never succeeded in creating an army, like the Viet Minh did in the Indochina war, and therefore was never able to rival the French?&#10;&#10;To address this, the game contains &ldquo;three games&rdquo; within the game: A political, an insurgency and a military game. Politics are driven by chits which alter four parameters: FLN structure; Algerian population; Pied noir feelings (the French settlers in Algeria) and French public/government. Each one will affect the play, in different ways, when it changes. What eventually ends the game is when the French public reaches 0 and calls for a referendum. Then you check each region whether they will vote to stay with France or become independent. If a majority votes pro-France, the French player win and vice versa. It is through different insurgency or counterinsurgency actions that you will make a region pro-FLN or pro-France. Finally, the military part will allow you to contest or control regions. This will affect your ability to mobilize, tax and conduct insurgency/counterinsurgency actions.&#10;&#10;In other words, you will have to fight to control, conduct insurgency/counterinsurgency actions in order to win the hearts and minds of the population and, through politics, see to it that the public in France either supports you or gets fed up with the war. Some things might help you in one way but at the same time give disadvantages in other aspects. Nothing in war is purely a good decision. There is always a cost.&#10;&#10;Each year has four gameturns. You start the game with eight random political chits of 28 possible ones. Each chit may only be played during a certain time span and after you play a chit you will draw a new one.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;operation points&rdquo; are the main engine in the game. You will receive a certain number of points and with these points you will pay for everything you do, like recruiting or bringing in reinforcements, certain movement, fighting and conducting insurgency/counterinsurgency actions.&#10;&#10;FLN recruitment will depend on how pro-FLN the Algerian population is and how efficient the FLN structure is. It will also depend on population density and whether they control a region or not. The French can bring in new units and replacements, but it will cost operation points and put pressure on the French public. So the reason to attack is to control/contest as much as possible and to force the opponent to spend operation points to replenish his force.&#10;&#10;The counters have no movement points. With a gameturn of three months there is no lack of time to position units anywhere on the map. You follow the road network (as French) but it will cost you operation points when you pass regions which are controlled by the enemy. FLN moves off-road and will have some limitations to whether they may leave a region or not. The numbers represent strength and quality.&#10;&#10;Fighting will include combat chits which in certain combination will affect the combat. My first ambition is to minimize the amount of tables in order to make the game faster to play. You roll a number of dice corresponding with your strength and modify your roll with the difference in quality. You get a hit when you roll 5-6. The complexity and difficulties lies more in what to decide and when to do it.&#10;&#10;Best regards&#10;Kim Kanger&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The Germans believed they could launch an offensive on both sides of Reims, which would pinch out an Allied salient and draw in Allied reserves, and thus possibly produce a breakout across the Marne leading to the final drive to Paris. Despite gaining their bridgehead across the Marne, the Germans did not expect the fierce resistance offered by the Allies including the American 3rd infantry division-which earned its honorific name &ldquo;Rock of the Marne&rdquo; for its steadfast defense.&#10;&#10;An even bigger surprise awaited the Germans, however, when the Allies attacked them with crushing power from a wholly unforeseen direction three days later. Refusing at first to relinquish the initiative, the Germans showed why they were masters of defensive warfare in World War 1 as they exacted a fearsome toll in casualties from the attackers including the American 1st and 2nd infantry divisions.&#10;&#10;Rock of the Marne shares many of its design features with MMP&rsquo;s earlier game on the 1918 battles - Operation Michael. The Germans&rsquo; striking power consists of the battle-depleted, but still dangerous, stosstruppen. Trained specifically in infiltration tactics, these hard-core infantry units can find a way to pick apart the toughest Allied defensive position. The Germans also have mobile, and deadly, machine-gun units that will wreak havoc on unwary attacking Allied units. The Allies used tanks in record numbers in their initial assault, and these are shown in the game, as well as the six big American divisions that participated including the famous 1st Infantry Div, The Big Red One, the 42nd Infantry Div, the Rainbow Division, as well at the 3rd.&#10;&#10;The air game has been significantly expanded in Rock of Marne as both sides deploy their air assets to bomb bridges, and strafe infantry.

For reasons still unknown, right before the attack the German 9th Army ordered three battalions the GD Division to move to the Luchessa Valley as OKH reserve, thus backing up the weak 216th Grenadier Regiment. Because of the presence of the GD, the Soviets were unable to force a breakthrough and decided to commit the 3rd Mech Corps into the meat grinder to force the issue...&#10;&#10;Designer Wig Graves conducted extensive research, combing both German and Soviet sources to create the order of battle. The Soviets begin with seemingly overwhelming force, while the Germans trade space for time and attempt to rush reinforcements to the front to plug inevitable gaps. While the Germans are primarily on the defense, careful counter-attacks against the relatively immobile Soviet formations can prove to be key to victory. And if the Soviets do not preserve their forces carefully, they will end with the historical result: stable German lines and an entire mechanized corps wrecked.&#10;&#10;GD &rsquo;42 uses the new Tactical Combat Series rules.

Piers' rent depends not only on the weather, but also the presence or absence of a cruise ship, which is also affected by the card events.

Between the lemmings and their goal there are two eagles circling overhead hoping for multiple lemming snacks.&#10;&#10;Each turn a movement card is revealed which will allow for 2-5 lemming movement points. Card luck is mitigated in that all players use the same card to move that turn.

The down side is that the top lemming in each stack is the only one in danger of becoming eagle chow.&#10;&#10;Special Actions allow players to briefly alter the normal rules of the game to their advantage or to their opponents' detriment.

One point is scored for each field tile in the player's largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group.&#10;&#10;Points are also scored for the worker tiles a player places on their country board.  The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile.  Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles.  When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action.  Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands.  There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player.&#10;&#10;There are usually six field tiles available at any time from the registry.  On their turn a player may bid for up to two tiles using crop counters.  The field tile being bid for and the bid in crop counters are placed in the player's store.  On their turn the other players may match the store owner's bid in both the number and type of crop counters.  If they choose to do so, then they place the field tile on their country board and pay the crop counters to the store owner.  If no other player has matched the store owner's bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock.&#10;&#10;When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile.  It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters.&#10;&#10;When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile.  A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile.  If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile.  However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker's ability again.  Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game.&#10;&#10;Players have two actions per turn.  There are four possible actions.  Each action can only be performed once per turn.  As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b).  Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d).  A player may also harvest crops by turning over some unharvested field tiles on their country board - action (a).&#10;&#10;Field tiles taken from the registry are replaced immediately with field tiles from the bag.  The bag also contains a number of event tiles.  The event tiles, when drawn, affect all of the players, not just the player who drew the event tile.  When the tenth event tile is drawn, the game ends after two further rounds have been played.&#10;&#10;One point is also awarded to the players who have the most of each of the types of crop counters at the end of the game.  No points are awarded for ties.  Points are tallied using the scoring track on the town board.  The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Nr. 4 in the QWG Master Print Edition series, as Demetra&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "GMT's fifth epic game in its award-winning series of east front games, Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov. This is a two-player, or two-team, operational level game depicting the battles of the southern wing of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during 1941. This game picks up where an earlier game in this series, Barbarossa: Army Group South, left off. It begins in mid-August and ends in December 1941, historically near the cities Kharkov and Rostov.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;&#10;     Three 22 x 34 inch maps&#10;     One 24 x 34 inch map&#10;     1120 counters&#10;     Series rule book plus a scenarios book&#10;     Various player aid cards for charts and tables&#10;     Set up cards for each scenario&#10;&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, NKVD, Stormtroopers, militia, base units, and more. You can tailor your army to fight a lengthy campaign over variable conditions.&#10;&#10;Despite its size we have kept the overall rules within the context of other games in this series thereby leaving nearly all mechanics familiar to veteran East Front Series (EFS) players. Such familiar mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away. For those who are new to the series, many examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.&#10;&#10;Note that all games of the Barbarossa, or EFS, series are built to fit together. If space is at a premium for you, please note that four of the eight scenarios here in this game alone require only one map or less.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?&#10;&#10;THE SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;&#10;     Learning Scenario: Rostov Redeemed. The German 3rd Motorized Corps has just taken Rostov and now attempts to hold it against a massive Soviet counteroffensive. This was the first in what turned out to be a series of disasters that befell the German army during the winter of 1941/42.&#10;     Kiev Pocket. In mid-August the Germans had just cleared the Uman Pocket (the last battle of the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series) and looked to exploit their advantage to quickly conquer the rest of the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviets had built a whole new group of armies to the east of the Dnepr River. This campaign resulted in the greatest encirclement battle of the war, perhaps of all time, as the Soviets over-committed to the defense of the river. Yet this was not a sure victory. Play testers have called this scenario the best yet in the entire series of games. You simply must experience this battle, one of the decisive battles of the war in the east.&#10;     Battle on the Sea of Azov. In late September with disaster looming to the north and a German offensive building against the Crimea, the relatively untouched Soviet 9 and 18 Armies in the southern portion of the Dnepr Bend were called upon to act, this time to save their comrades defending the Crimea by striking toward the rear of the German 11th Army. While their attack made but small headway, some Romanian defenders were overwhelmed. The situation could have opened up to destroy the German rear and then threaten the rear of the rest of German Army Group South. Perhaps this offensive could as well reverse the tide of the German advance. Or was someone in the Kremlin just dreaming?&#10;     Battle of Sumy. Some small battles lend themselves wonderfully to focus treatment and this battle at the end of September near the north Ukrainian town of Sumy certainly qualifies. Handled on its own special map this becomes a contest of mobility between a German motorized corps on the one hand and a strong Soviet cavalry corps on the other, with the Soviets getting timely reinforcements from the 1 Guards Motorized Rifle Division. This very balanced situation plays quickly and perhaps is the best introduction in the series to the game system.&#10;     To Kharkov. It has become almost trite to say Russia is vast but for this scenario the German player will declare this many times. Even though the German has just won the Kiev Pocket Battle, now the great industrial city of Kharkov beckons in the distant east. The Soviets have reassembled their armed forces yet again but this time the German has sent his panzers north to Moscow and out of this game (see GMT's Typhoon! Game). German 6th Army, a true hard-luck formation, gets the honor of leading the advance and they now experience their first starvation of the war, similar to that they will suffer at Stalingrad a year later, although without the desperation of that later battle. Even so, the 6th Army is formidable; so will the arrival of mud be the only thing saving the Soviet's behind? Or, will he have finally mastered the art of war against the Nazis?&#10;     To Rostov. The most dramatic moment of the late drive to the east was the drive to Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus where lay the oilfields the Germans so vitally needed to run their war machine. The Germans have won victory after victory for nearly six months even though the Soviets have set successive armies in their path. Is this perhaps the Soviet last ditch and their last army? Are the Germans truly at the end of their supply line? Will winter stop the Germans? Historically in this near even contest, the panzers actually got into the streets of Rostov; can you?&#10;     Kiev to Rostov. This is the full campaign, mid-August through December, a very full 57 turns over vast distances. The Germans begin in supply difficulty and will have to pick a pause to advance their main bases. The Soviet player will have to take care he does not expend all his effort too far to the west, thereby leaving nothing for the final battles. Neither player has resources to do it all but it can be fun trying. The East Front experience is not complete without playing this full-size scenario. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

On one side of the wall lay the Chinese provinces, each with its own point value. On the other side are the provinces of the Mongol invaders, each with a randomly-assigned negative point value. Since provinces on either side do not directly correspond to each other, the goal is to place your pieces so that you can attain a majority on the Chinese side (for positive points) while avoiding having a majority on the Mongolian side (for negative points). Players also have a set of cards (tiles actually) that give them a few special privileges to help themselves or interfere with other players.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with optional cards that may be used to provide other methods of scoring points.&#10;&#10;",

From Mayfair&rsquo;s description of the game: &ldquo;You must shrewdly accept the building orders of the patrician families to position yourself in the right place at the right time. Play your cards right, and your name will be famous among the rich and powerful!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Patrician comes with 149 wooden tower pieces, 55 building cards, 20 prestige tokens, and a double-sided playing board.&#10;&#10;The board represents a number of cities, each of which will have 2 towers when the games ends.  Players have a hand of 3 cards, each indicating one city.  Playing a card allows that player to add a tower piece to the city indicated by the card.  Each city will have a specific number of tower pieces.  When the specified number of pieces are played to the city, the city is complete.  The player with the most pieces in each of the two towers will score points when the city is completed. The player replaces the played card by taking the card from the city where he played a tower piece.  As long as the city in uncompleted, a new card is added to the city to replace the one taken by the player.&#10;&#10;In addition to indicating a city, cards have one of 4 secondary functions.  They can have one or two Portraits from an influential family.  They can add a second tower piece to the same city. they can allow the player to move the top piece from one tower in any other city where the player has at least one tower piece, to the top of the other tower in that same city. Finally, a card may allow the player to take a replacement card from any of the cities, not just the one where the player has added a tower piece.  All cards played are kept by the player.  At the end of the game, additional points are awarded for every complete set of 3 portraits from the influential families.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all cities are completed, which will also be when all cards have been played.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the most successful builder, indicated by having the most points.&#10;&#10;",

Oh no, no, rather offering them scary ghost infestations!!! Some eccentric characters fight in an auction to be assigned castles and manors. This, in the hope that presences will not be too numerous! Even if a castle without ghosts may be found useless, on the contrary one which is too &ldquo;populated&rdquo; will end up terrorizing tourists and being valueless...&#10;&#10;Every player, after having seen the various castles, can declare what was seen, by showing his signs &ldquo;picture&rdquo; or &ldquo;ghost&rdquo;.&#10;Were there gloomy presences or only old and powdery family portraits? But beware, not all declarations are reliable: many players could lie... or perhaps all of them?&#10;&#10;In the first phase players must decide whether in that very turn they will lie or tell always the truth.&#10;Mrs Truelight could help everyone to find out actual results of such decisions, but she is greedy and therefore she will reveal precious indications only to best bidders.&#10;&#10;Caution is vital: the ones who pay more money too early will turn out having less funds to offer in the second phase auction for castles. Shall we have enough money to steal best ones to our competitors? Every castle has a score according to the number of ghosts by whom it is haunted.&#10;&#10;The player who succeeds in guessing where ghosts are and their exact number will achieve optimum business, becoming able to buy what he/she wants in a fairly relaxed mode and allowing himself/herself even the luxury to mislead adversaries with fake offers.&#10;&#10;Ghost for sale is a clever deductive game, with a subtle bluffing component, for 3 to 5 players, suitable for all the families, but with a strategy component that will not leave indifferent even most experienced gamers. In the box there are 8 special cards to be used for &ldquo;special auctions&rdquo;, which constitute a set for playing advanced rules games and which, randomly combined to the various castles and manors, guarantee rounds which are always exciting and different.&#10;&#10;English, German and Italian Rules available for download here&#10;&#10;",

In addition, there is a race to the top of each barnyard point track in order to acquire the most valuable animals for the farm. Players may also &ldquo;rotate crops&rdquo; by using their tiles to cover up fields that bring their opponent&rsquo;s points, possibly expanding their own farms in the process.

And there are copyists, who will dispute the glory you've earned for your monuments...&#10;&#10;The game shows monument cards with 12 types of ancient monuments like the Pyramids or the Colosseum (9 per type). The game is played in turns and usually you take a &quot;monument turn,&quot; consisting of 3 actions allowing you to collect cards, to build monuments, and to expand your existing monuments. For example, it takes you one action per card to draw it either from the draw pile or the 3 faceup cards near it.&#10;&#10;If you have some cards showing the same monument, you can use another action to erect this monument in your display. In case you are the first one to build this type of monument, you only need two cards - the second player building this same type of monument must have at least 3 cards. And no third player is allowed to build the same monument! Thus, playing your cards early makes it easier for you to erect the monument. But it saves you actions to collect some cards before displaying it, because regardless of the number of cards used, erecting one monument only counts as one single action.&#10;&#10;Your monuments will receive their eternal fame only, if they are part of history. Each player has 2 (in a 3 player game: 3) historian tokens. In a historian turn, you have no monument action, but only write a history about all of your OPPONENTS' monuments (not your own ones!). Monuments get famous, and the owners receive victory points at the end of the game - the more often your monuments are in such histories, the more points you get. However, only interesting monuments of at least two cards are considered for a history, and by writing a history, the historian takes one card away (removes it from the game)! Thus the monument could be cut down to only one card during the game and will be not interesting to later historians any more. Why should I write a history and make the monuments of my opponents more worthy? If you do not use all of your historian tokens, you will be punished with 12 negative points at the end of the game! And you get additional victory points in the case that you write histories with a lot of monuments mentioned in it.&#10;&#10;You should make your monuments interesting to historians again. During a monument turn, you may use one action (regardless of the number of cards played at the same time) to add cards to a monument that you have already erected.&#10;&#10;In MONUMENTS, timing is important, and you have to decide what the best move to do now is: Should I wait for another Petra card, or shall I display the Petra Monument this turn? Is it advisable to make a historian turn now or is it better to choose a monument turn and draw the faceup cards, which I really need - taking the risk that I cannot write a history next turn and wind up getting negative points!&#10;&#10;Finally, you have to consider that you are not sure about the victory points for your monuments. The points are related to the monument during the game, and if the Akropolis monument is worth 12 Points for example, you will only get 4 points if another player manages to erect an Akropolis monument that is greater than yours. This damn copyist will not only receive all your bad wishes, but 8 of the 12 Akropolis Victory Points - even in the case that his monument was not part of any history. Somehow you will feel that all the glory should be given to you alone!&#10;&#10;",

If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the city's growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals, and win elections.&#10;&#10;In Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes, and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayor's grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try to take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy.&#10;&#10;Tammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations. While the organization's influence spanned from its founding in the 1790s to its collapse in the 1960s, this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870 &ndash; the era of Boss Tweed.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;8 page rulebook&#10;1 Game board&#10;5 City Office cards&#10;25 Green Immigrant cubes&#10;25 White Immigrant cubes&#10;25 Orange Immigrant cubes&#10;25 Blue Immigrant cubes&#10;35 Green Political Favor Chips&#10;35 White Political Favor Chips&#10;35 Orange Political Favor Chips&#10;35 Blue Political Favor Chips&#10;20 Red Ward Boss Markers&#10;20 Yellow Ward Boss Markers&#10;20 Purple Ward Boss Markers&#10;20 Black Ward Boss Markers&#10;20 Neutral Ward Boss Markers&#10;15 Slander Chips&#10;2 Council President Markers&#10;1 Year Marker&#10;1 Political Favor Chip Sticker Sheet&#10;1 Drawstring Pouch&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Rise of Empires is an empire-building game in which players develop their ever changing empire from Ancient Age to Modern Age. War, economics, science and diplomacy are to be taken into consideration to successfully win this epic game.&#10;&#10;In Rise of Empires two to five players are building their own civilization from the dawn of history to present times. All players start small and fairly powerless, however, through clever play they try to gain wealth and progress in several areas.  Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires is divided into three eras. Each era consists of two game turns. The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn. The first turn in an era is called the A turn, the second one the B turn. In a way, the B turn is a mirror image of the A turn.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Victory points are scored by building cities, having an empire (area control), developing technology, and trading goods.&#10;&#10;In contrast to some other civilization type games, Rise of Empires plays fairly quickly. A full game can be completed in less than three hours.  It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Don't just make history-guide it! Take the reins of a developing civilization, choosing the resources and development paths that will lead to the fastest expansion, as you claim and defend territory on a map forging an empire that eventually encompasses whole continents.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires play is divided into three eras. Choices made early in the era are repeated late, so your decisions must have both short-term and long-term benefits to be successful. This process requires tough decision-making and promotes an atmosphere with nail-biting suspense. Victory points are rewarded for building cities, having an empire, for progress in science, and for trading goods.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires breathes new life into the civilization games genre! Balance gold and food, war and agriculture, territory and technology to forge an empire that is destined to rise above all other nations!&#10;&#10;Each copy of Rise of Empires contains:&#10;. 1 large game board&#10;. 1 tiles display&#10;. 40 resource discs&#10;. 150 player cubes in 5 colors&#10;. 45 action discs in 5 colors&#10;. 8 empire tiles&#10;. 40 territory tiles&#10;. 48 progress tiles&#10;. 36 city tiles&#10;. 104 gold markers&#10;. 5 alliance pieces&#10;. 5 player aid cards&#10;. 1 rules booklet with illustrated example of play.&#10;&#10;",

Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.  As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Jenseits von Theben&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If a player passes, he picks up all the stones currently on the table and places his token on top of the token pile. The last player remaining grabs all the cards of the color he had chosen earlier in the round. The second to last player, whose token now sits at the top of the token pile, then picks up all the cards of his chosen color if any cards of that color are left. The same process is repeated for each player when their token is at the top of the token pile. The game ends when all the cards of the deck have been claimed. Players then earn points for each animal for which they have majority.&#10;&#10;Components: 54 cards, 50 stones, 30 markers, rules.&#10;&#10;Released: Essen 2007.&#10;&#10;",
