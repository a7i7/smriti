        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;In September 1944, Operation Market Garden was intended to open a direct path for the Allied armies to circumvent the West Wall and threaten Germany's industrial Ruhr heartland. British, American and Polish airborne forces were ordered to assault and capture key bridges along the main highway leading through Holland, the Arnhem bridge being the most distant of them all. Unfortunately, the Allies had gravely underestimated the strength of German forces in the area; so, when the airborne forces landed, they found themselves scattered amid an SS panzer division. The various bridges thus became the fulcrum of the entire operation for both sides.&#10;&#10;Arnhem utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From mortars to self-propelled artillery, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by tanks &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy paratrooper battalion defending a landing zone. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself strafed by enemy fighter-bombers. More support will be necessary to take the landing zone, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Arnhem, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting for Arnhem. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Arnhem&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It is clearly written that anyone to whom the King awards the title of Royal Steward will manage the Wieliczka Salt Mine, called Magnum Sal. His Majesty the King will give this royal stewardship to the foreman who by his work shows that he is the best in the craft of salt mining, and he will lead the operations of the Cracow Salt Mine for the glory of the Polish Kingdom.&#10;&#10;Magnum Sal is a eurogame about exploration of a salt mine (second oldest still operating salt mine in the world). Each player takes the role of a foreman - the manager of a mining team. During the game, players will try to extract salt most efficiently from the mine, sell their &quot;white gold&quot; at the market, and above all complete the king's salt orders. The player who earns the most money from extracting salt receives the title of Royal Steward and wins the game.&#10;&#10;(From the rulebook)&#10;&#10;Magnum Sal is latin name that Wieliczka was noted in some documents for the first time - it means Great Salt. From this latin name, Wieliczka was formed - Magnum (Latin) -&gt; Great (EN) -&gt; Wielki (PL)&#10;&#10;Quote from wikipedia (there is no source for this but it's probably the way that the name Wieliczka was formed): &#10;Magnum Sal (latin) -&gt; Wielka S&oacute;l -&gt; Wielika S&oacute;l -&gt; Wielicka -&gt; Wieliczka&#10;&#10;",

The search can be interrupted as other players play dinosaur (and other) cards to cause mayhem and carnage. Once the treasure is located, players draw treasures from a bag, looking to avoid the pirate ghost and island sinking events, and return safe to their ship &ndash; a question of how far they'll go in pushing their luck.&#10;&#10;",

By effective speculation on the stock market, a player may take control of more than one corporation. Proper corporation management is preferable but not the most essential.&#10;The rules attempt to simulate real conditions of business competition and relationships between shareholders.&#10;&#10;THERE IS NO LUCK FACTOR.&#10;Internal balance discourages to play in a relation of 2(3) players versus 1.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules are quite easy and intuitive. It is the most difficult to use the rules effectively by good planning and predicting opponents&rsquo; plans.&#10;Players manage their corporations by investing in new factories and trading produced goods to earn money (like in many other games). The point is what the players do with earned money. They can re-invest it to make their corporations earn more during next phase or try to make pressure on another player by buying shares of his/her corporation. The player who has the biggest number of shares can be elected by voting as a new leader of the corporation for the next stage. Even if you don`t have enough shares to take control over another player`s firm, the investment can be quite beneficiary because it can give you some profit (if that firm is managed well) or enforce your opponent to use the corporation money for defending, which makes his final result worse than could be achieved without your pressure.&#10;&#10;Of course, the more players (max 4), the more fun there is during voting phase when all the shareholders, who are going to manage the corporation in the next stage, vote.&#10;&#10;The game tries to extract maximum advantage of double circulation of money you can find in the &quot;Imperial&quot;. Players have money and corporations have money. So, what is new then? Besides the players, also the corporations can be shareholders and they all (corporations and players) vote for new leaders. It means that if you want to keep control over a corporation you had started with, you can, for instance, first take control over some weaker corporation which has some shares of yours. The best defense is attack, isn`t it? ;) The only weapon in this war is money.&#10;&#10;There are some tools of defense, so taking control over experienced opponent`s corporation is rather difficult, though possible. When an experienced player plays versus a beginner, he/she shouldn`t have a problem with it. Moreover, keeping control of the corporation is useful, because it is a way of generating money for the leader, although speculating by buying and selling shares is a bit more efficient. It is the best to go both ways at the same time, choosing and changing your engagement alternately.&#10;&#10;Well, it is also possible to play without any corporation and increase the value of private property only by playing as a stock market profiteer, but this way is recommended only for very experienced players.&#10;&#10;There is a fixed variant of playing 2 vs. 2.&#10;&#10;",

One player begins as the Thing - all the other players start as human.&#10;&#10;The game is primarily played out using six asymmetrical card decks - three decks for each side (each deck corresponds to a different section of the narrative). Managing your hand of cards, and when to use each deck, is key to winning the game.&#10;&#10;The twelve members of the Outpost 31 team cards are positioned between the players, with each human player taking one character. The team then have to overcome various encounters, while trying to stay alive, in an effort to stop the Thing. Encounters are directly taken from film events, and are sorted into three separate acts - the second and third acts are shuffled, and then all three acts are placed together, forming one narrative (in this way, each game is a little different). Some example encounters: Autopsy of Norwegian-Thing, Battle in Dogtown, Explore Norwegian Base, Conduct Blood Test, and Investigate Crashed Saucer Site. In addition, the Outpost team must allocate men to tasks that may aid in their victory over the Thing. The truth being that the humans will not be able to achieve all that they want to do and will have to prioritise. All the while, the Thing player will do all in its power to thwart the human players, while attempting to construct its Blair-saucer in a secret ice cavern by cannibalising parts from the bulldozer, radio room, and helicopter.&#10;&#10;During the game, at various stages, the Thing player has the opportunity to place infection or dummy infection cards under the human character cards.

The humans must keep their wits about them if they are to fight and win against the Thing, or they may find themselves fighting each other....&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;1. The Outpost #31 team win if they survive the final confrontation, having destroyed the camp and sabotaged the Thing's Blair-saucer - and have killed all the Things.&#10;&#10;     If they are mistaken and some Things remain: the Things win.&#10;     If they killed a non-infected player: the Thing wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;2.

Those filthy drovers and gunslingers are dangerous and desperate, each one generally havin' killed a man, and be content to live on a diet of Navy plug and whiskey.&#10;I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after hearin' this here stupefyin' story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess you folks can make up yer own minds why I retired early.&#10;&#10;The year is 1892.&#10;The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed.&#10;Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as Colty's gang shot its way, whooping and hollering, out of town.&#10;Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he'd steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man's eyes - and his gang to justice.&#10;&#10;Revolver is a non-collectable card game set in the Old West.&#10;&#10;Consisting of two balanced 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang.&#10;&#10;At their disposal, the Colty gang - the meanest bunch of low down dirty dogs in the West - have a roster of weaponry to bring down the lawmen on their tail: .38 Specials, .45 Long Colts, 1866 double barrel Derringers, and even a Gatling gun! Some example cards from the gang's deck: Cherokee Scout, &quot;Adios, Amigoes!&quot;, &quot;Thanks for yer coffee and eggs, ma'am&quot;, and &quot;Chew on this, Gringo!&quot;&#10;&#10;The Colonel player's objective is to eliminate all the gang members before they can escape across the Mexican border. He can utilise such cards as Buffalo Stampede, Rattlesnake Bite, &quot;I can smell those yellow bellies on the wind&quot;, &quot;He shot my hat clean off!&quot; Apache Scout, and Rickety Bridge.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Revolver is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive gunfights in the following battlegrounds: The Bank at Repentance Springs, Whiskey Canyon, Buzzard Point, Rattlesnake Creek, and the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with bandits gunned down frequently, and law-men peppered with lead by the well-placed use of &quot;Fire at will, boys.&quot;&#10;&#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colty player could choose to deploy the Jackson Clan during the Whiskey Canyon battle, but the resources that this would require might make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Colonel McReady player can deploy the Colonel at any time during the conflict - he's free to play aboard the 3:15 Express Train, but hugely expensive if used at Buzzard Point, for instance. Also, during the final confrontation, Jack Colty can force the train to crash - as a last ditch effort, probably killing some of his own crew in the process - he's as crazy as popcorn on a hot stove!&#10;&#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. Some simple icons are used to display such things as 'coming-into-play' effects, and if a gringo has 'True Grit'.&#10;&#10;Revolver can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, and is a new implementation of Aliens: This Time It's War.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;The Colty Gang player wins if he manages to &quot;Escape across the Mexican border.&quot;&#10;The Colty Gang player wins if he reaches and survives the battle on the 3:15 Express train.&#10;The Colonel McReady player wins if Jack Colty and all the gang members are either hanged or killed.&#10;The Colonel McReady player wins if Cortez is killed before boarding the 3:15 Express train.&#10;&#10;Each bandit character card has a Survival Rating, indicating the likelihood of them surviving to the end of the game. For example, Lenny and Micky Mason have a low chance of survival, whereas Cortez has a high Survival Rating. Also, certain character's deaths have hugely detrimental effects on the game, such as having to discard a card, or in &quot;Kittens&quot; Mackenzie's case: the gang having to fight an extra two turns on the Rattlesnake Creek battlefield.&#10;&#10;",

You must work with or against the other survivors to be the last one standing.  No not standing, cowering in the corner crying for their mommy.&#10;&#10;In the spirit of AMC's &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, Eaten By Zombies takes you into a dark world of eventual death. Every turn you must venture out from your safehouse and scavenge for Swag. But not so fast, the Undead have other plans for your brains. Every day a Horde of fresh zombies will be waiting for you, and over time the threat gets greater. Now it's time for your &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; instincts to help you to survive just one more day. Using the swag you've got on you (ie cards in you hand) you must survive any way you can.&#10;&#10;If you can get away or kill the Horde, you may scavenge the remains of the desolate suburbs for any Swag the neighbors may have left behind.   With the right stuff and a few good friends to out run, you may just make it through this alive... well, no probably not.  But being the last one to die a slow, painful death means you can claim sole victory!&#10;&#10;With a set of over thirty different cards to start with, no two games will ever be alike. This game is a combination of Card Drafting, Hand Management and Survival Horror with a few dirty tricks thrown in.&#10;&#10;Game Play/Mechanics &#10;You start with five heavy sticks (each worth +1 fight) and five hide cards (each +1 flee) as well as two sandwiches (+1 Flee &amp; Draw one card).  You shuffle these 12 cards and draw 6 into your hand.  You then face one of the 25 zombies from the Zombie Deck with a fight value ranging from 1-8 and a flee value of 1-4.  You must announce Fight or Flee and then proceed to play some/all of your 6 cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;If you successfully fight/flee you then take the total fight/flee value to the scavenging portion of your turn (think of it as a &quot;buy&quot;) where you acquire items such as Shotguns, fists full of ammo, crowbar, binoculars, fire on a stick, grandma pantry, deadeye or other cards which you then put INTO YOUR HAND for use in the very next turn and draw back up to 6 cards from your draw deck.  Played cards go to your discard pile, including any zombies you have succeeded in killing.&#10;&#10;If you flee then the zombie card goes to the zombie discard pile.  As you draw zombies into your hand (from shuffling your discard pile) you are stuck with them in your hand forever unless you play them into the zombie horde attacking on another player's turn, so the zombie horde gets tougher over time.&#10;&#10;If you are unsuccessful in killing/fleeing then you must lose a number of cards equal to the flee value of the horde.  These lost cards come from either your hand or as a blind draw off the top of your draw pile and go back to the scavenging area, weakening you.  If you run out of cards you succumb to your wounds and become a zombie, now trying to kill the other players on each turn.&#10;&#10;If a player ever ends up with six zombie cards in his/her hand the zombie players win as the remaining players have gone insane.  Each time the zombie deck is gone through and reshuffled you add one more zombie to the horde for the rest of the game, making perpetual survival impossible.&#10;&#10;It isn't a matter of if you're going to die but when.  Be the last player standing and win.  If at any time the entire zombie deck is depleted (because the players have killed all of them rather than using flee), all remaining players alive win together.&#10;&#10;This is a unique cooperative/competitive game where you really feel the tension and inevitability of doom.  You spend the first few turns building up your deck only to see the zombies increase in power and slowly drain your will to live as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Eaten By Zombies!: In Cahoots&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Avalon Hill's (AH) Bismarck 1979/80 edition, designed by Jack Greene, is a totally different game from the AH 1962 edition designed by Lindsley Schutz and Charles Roberts.&#10;&#10;The game centered around the hunt for the KMS Bismarck and the KMS Prinz Eugen in mid-1941. The game has some similarities to game Battleship, with both players having a hidden map-board and calling out coordinates to locate their opponent.&#10;&#10;There are two players, German and British. The British player has the arduous task of placing the large number of Royal Navy vessels and search aircraft on his map-board before game play begins. Each map-board is on a grid, with letters on one axis, and numbers on the other. Each Royal Navy unit has a historically accurate starting point. The German setup takes but a moment, since the Germans have only a few bomber units and the task force with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen to place on their map.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players move their respective units (cardboard counters), searching for enemy units, and possibly engaging in combat. In the vast spaces of the Bering Sea and North Atlantic, the search phase becomes vital. Each player calls out grid coordinates containing a ship or aircraft, and the opponent indicates whether a ship is located there, and if so what type. A player may choose not to search with a particular unit, thus keeping its location secret (common tactic for German player, obviously). Since the Bismarck is the only enemy Battleship on the map, British discovery of her is key to victory. As the British are unlikely to have a force sufficient to sink the Bismarck when they initially find her, they will need to &quot;shadow&quot; the mighty vessel. A fast unit, such as the Heavy Cruiser Suffolk, is able to keep up with Bismarck and follow her on radar without engaging in combat.&#10;&#10;Eventually, British heavy units, such as the Battlecruiser Hood may be vectored into the same square as the German Task Force. At this point combat ensues. The British also have air units on the Aircraft Carriers Victorious and Ark Royal which can both search for the Germans and attack with torpedoes from a distance. The game has combat damage sheets with squares representing areas of each warship that can be damaged in combat. As combat is resolved, squares are checked off.&#10;&#10;The Germans win by avoiding contact with the British, successfully &quot;breaking out&quot; into the Atlantic and ravaging merchant shipping there. They can also achieve victory by destroying any opposition they encounter and making their way to a friendly port in occupied France. Historically, either scenario would have grave consequences for the Battle of the Atlantic. The British have a tougher task, needing to intercept and destroy the Germans. Since most British vessels are no match for Bismarck, it is necessary to vector several vessels currently on convoy escort duties in the area to form a powerful task force. Poor planning by the British or clever moves by the Germans allow Bismarck to slip through.&#10;&#10;The advanced rules of the game implement a weather system, combat using a miniatures-type system (with ship counters laid out on the floor), realistic damage to ships, etc. Alternate &quot;what if&quot; scenarios and ships are provided, such as the German Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin, breakout with the Tirpitz and others. U-boats are also represented (albeit in an abstract way) in the Advanced game.&#10;&#10;Second edition changes included:&#10;&#10;     the square grid on the original map was replaced with a  hexagonal brick grid overlay;  &#10;     the single Bismarck ship unit was replaced by multiple German ships; &#10;     the relatively simple search, movement and combat systems of the original were replaced by much more complex rules. (Indeed, many considered the rules changes ponderous and detrimental to gameplay.)&#10;     packaging was modified, second edition coming in a smaller, standard-sized AH flat box (compared to the over-sized box of the first edition) and having alternative cover artwork.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The forces come in five strengths, which from weakest to strongest are Lance, Bow, Sword, Helmet and Banner.

Each player starts with a hand of five cards and a location card on the table depicting five territories, which is where a player lays his cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws a card from the deck, then lays one card from his hand into one of the territories next to his location card. Each territory can have no more than four cards in it. Once you've played four cards into a territory, you've determined the final strength of the army there.

The Great Khan rules from the capital Karakorum over the empire and he sends out his best generals to conquer more areas for the ruler of all Mongols. Mongol strategy gives individual generals a high degree of independence in deciding how to invade and conquer new territories, so long as they keep to the overall objectives. The Mongol armies are highly mobile and enemies are terrorized by their ability to appear everywhere at once. To prevent enemy rulers from being able to regain control of their armies, the Mongols drive the rulers out and pursue them relentlessly wherever they flee.&#10;&#10;In KHAN it's your task to chase out the 8 different rulers of the lands that you are invading and to conquer as many valuable areas as you can. The general that fulfills this task the best will be proclaimed the next Great Khan.&#10;&#10;Each player invades areas by placing his yurts on the board. A player can then conquer two or more adjacent areas by laying one of the variously shaped conquer tiles over the yurts (not all the yurts need to be the player's own). Conquer tiles will bring the player victory points - the larger the conquer tile, the greater the number of victory points. At the end of the game the players with the largest connected conquered territories will gain additional victory points. The player who then has the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.&#10;&#10;The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be succesful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.&#10;&#10;Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.&#10;&#10;The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign.&#10;&#10;",

The game is the first game published by R&amp;D Games that has not been designed by Richard Breese.  Richard this time takes on the role of developer and the game consequently has the same look and feel as the previous Key games, with artwork again by Juliet Breese plus its own set of ani-/vegi-/arti-meeples.&#10;&#10;Each player controls an extended family of workers.  Over the course of two years, players will organise their workers in an attempt to turn their initial scanty resources into a thriving economic system.&#10;&#10;After an initial set up phase, the game is played over eight seasons.  Each season has three distinct phases, during which players may take a variety of actions.  The topography, weather, and seasons will influence the ability of workers to produce crops and livestock in the fields and luxuries in the villages.  In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favours sought and acquired.  Other workers may be sponsored to join the powerful guilds, where they will acquire skills as they gain promotion to become craftsmen or even the guild master.&#10;&#10;Turn order throughout the game is determined by the player&rsquo;s position on the season track, which changes at the end of each season.  At the end of the game, the player who has acquired the most gold will win the game.&#10;&#10;David Brain&rsquo;s designer notes on the box sides conclude by stating that &lsquo;Key Market is a reasonably intricate game.  Some of the strategies that can be employed (particularly the effective use of the market) are not immediately apparent, and some of the Guild combinations do not look so devastating at first glance.  But for those looking for a challenging medieval resource management/economic engine game, here you are.&rsquo;&#10;&#10;The game is for two to four players, with a game time of approximately 30 minutes plus 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;Key Market is a limited edition of 900 copies and was released at the Essen Spiel in October 2010.&#10;&#10;",

Fleeing to a mysterious mansion, you must gather any materials you can find to protect yourself and fight for your survival against a legion of infected beings!&#10;&#10;The Resident Evil DBG brings the story to life in a game of strategy where players construct their card decks while they play.  Choose one of your favorite characters from Resident Evil such as: Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, or Albert Wesker among others. Players start with only the most basic of items and weapons. As the game progresses, players build their arsenal with additional Weapons, Ammunition, Action or Item cards to customize their deck and improve their ability in defeating the Infected!  Your deck will be your lifeline to survival.  How will you survive the zombie outbreak?&#10;&#10;The Resident Evil DBG will consist of 250 playing cards, 3 different game modes (Story, Mercenary and Versus) and hundreds of possible scenarios within each mode for unlimited replay value.  No two games will ever be the same!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Story mode is the main version of the game where players must race to claim the best weapons, items, and ammunition before others get to it first. Quick thinking and a good instinct will help you survive the Mansion and be the one to escape to safety.  &#10;     Mercenary mode is similar to Story mode but this mode rewards the players that take the offensive. Players must prove their skills by defeating as many zombies as they can in a limited amount of time. This mode can be played in teams.&#10;     Versus mode removes the Infected from the game and pits the human characters against each other in a battle for dominance. Players must watch their back as they attempt to defeat each other while staying alive themselves. Watch out because you may find that players are not as merciful as the Infected!&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of one of the Heroes of Resident Evil. They start with a deck of 10 cards, which consist of Weapons and Ammo. Players must use their resources to obtain more powerful Weapons, Ammo, Items, and Action Cards that they add to their deck. As you progress in the game your Deck will become stronger and more efficient. You must use the cards in your deck to fight the &quot;Infected&quot; creatures which awards you Decorations . To win the game you must defeat more &quot;Infected&quot; creatures then your opponents, but the game only ends when the strongest &quot;Infected&quot; creatures is killed. Once he is killed, the player that has gained the most Decorations wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ammo cards are used to power your Weapons as well as purchase new cards.&#10;     Weapon cards are used to battle the &quot;Infected&quot; creatures. Stronger weapons require more ammo.&#10;     Item cards allow you to strengthen and Heal your Character.&#10;     Action cards give you additional actions that you can take during your turn, such as drawing more cards or improving the power of your weapons.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Contents&#10;&#10;     250 Cards&#10;     Game Manual&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Alliance&#10;    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Mercenaries&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Outbreak&#10;    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Nightmare&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Star Trek: Fleet Captains, designed for two or four players, is set in the &quot;Prime Universe&quot; of STAR TREK (as seen in the various TV series and movies up to Star Trek: Nemesis) and is more adversarial in nature when compared to Star Trek: Expeditions.  Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.  In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation.  Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding &ldquo;size.&rdquo;  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).&#10;&#10;Players then &ldquo;shuffle build&rdquo; a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player&rsquo;s strategy for winning.&#10;The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.&#10;&#10;Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.&#10;&#10;The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is &ldquo;trouble with tribbles.&rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points.&#10;&#10;Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).  The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek.&#10;&#10;",

It is built upon the cooperative board game model and the players will work together against the game itself.&#10;&#10;In the game, players assume the roles of Kirk, Spock, Bones and Uhura. The premise is the Federation has received a petition for membership from a planet and the Enterprise is dispatched to assess their application. When the Enterprise arrives, they discover:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A Klingon battle cruiser is in orbit;&#10;     Civil war is threatening to break out on the planet;&#10;     And the planet is (coincidentally?) reconsidering its application for UFP membership.&#10;&#10;&#10;Your mission is threefold; defuse the threat of civil war, deal with the Klingon threat and get the planet to join the UFP. And you only have 30 days (roughly equaling 30 turns) in which to do it. or a Klingon battle fleet will warp in and you will be forced to withdraw (thus failing your mission).&#10;&#10;Each objective is tracked on a scoresheet that monitors your progress. Decisions you make in the game as well as how you interact with the other players will affect the outcome of the mission.&#10;&#10;The four figures are fully rendered, 3D versions of the four Bridge officers. The four figures and two spaceships are similar to Heroclix figures, with the clicks on the dials at the base of the figure representing damage and corresponding diminished abilities.&#10;&#10;This product is designed as a non-collectible, non-blind, all-in-one-and-done game, but is built upon the &quot;expandable&quot; board game model meaning that down the line, new missions and crew members will be made available for folk to play other &quot;episodes&quot;!&#10;&#10;",
