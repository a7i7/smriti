        "name": "The Great Pacific War",
        "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Great Pacific War is Avalanche Press' strategic-level game of the War in the Pacific. The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.&#10;&#10;The system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.&#10;&#10;The facts:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.&#10;     The game system is built around players drawing impulse &quot;chits&quot; to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).&#10;&#10;&#10;The game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.&#10;&#10;In Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. Japan&Iacute;s lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.&#10;&#10;In the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Three 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; maps, &#10;560 playing pieces, &#10;rules, &#10;three scenario books, &#10;political events and charts.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: &#10;The maps are not mounted like those in JP's Third Reich were.  This solves the problem of the maps not adjoining properly (as in Third Reich), but will upset those that like hard mounted maps. &#10; The game marries up with JP's Third Reich, but don't expect the maps to do so.  When played together, action will be on separate maps to create a monster game of the entire Second World War.&#10;&#10;",

The laboratories of the Hybrid Code, private of resources, die out in their turn and sink in the lapse of memory.&#10;&#10;The Age of Darkness. &#10;The incommensurable energy released by the ritual of the Paddle, in the heart of Second Shamir, flows through the continent of Aarklash and reactivates the disastrous sanctuaries of the Hybrid Code...&#10;&#10;Nowadays, in Akkylannie. &#10;The population of the village of Glasinhar must face a terrible threat to which it is not prepared: monsters emerge from the entrails of the ground and are devoted to a massacre.&#10;Only a handle of warriors interposes between the impious creatures and the remainder of the continent: valorous Templiers of the Cabin of Hod.&#10; Hybrid Game Box&#10;&#10;Before disappearing, Dirz the Heresiarch, founder of the Empire of the Scorpion, nourished a shadowy project: Code Hybrid. Many decades later, Dirz's forgotten laboratories mysteriously reactivated themselves... Today, monsters spring from the innards of the earth! Only has handful of warriors stand&#10; between these impious creatures and the rest of the world: the Griffins of the Lodge of Hod. &#10;Come and join has blood-filled battle in the gloomy underground laboratories!&#10;&#10;The Hybrid&copy; game box includes 13 figurines, 1 Hybrid&copy; rule book, 110 cards, 9 playing boards and 2 dice. &#10;(in French on the site; badly translated here)&#10;&#10;Take part in a bloody battle in the corridors of lugubrious laboratories! &#10;Presented in preview at the time of the last show of the Monde de Jeu, HYBRID is the new game of the Rackham range. &#10;Although the action proceeds in the universe of Aarklash, the principles of play are very different from those of Confrontation and Rag' Narok : the game of Hybrid proceeds on richly detailed, square modular game tiles.&#10;&#10;You can achieve the ten perilous missions suggested in the basic booklet or to invent your own laboratories! &#10;The mechanisms are also innovative: Hybrid is played with dice with d10&rsquo;s. The capacities of each combatant are described in four characteristics to which many special Aptitudes are added, as the ability to emit an aura of battle or to become stronger after each death inflicted upon the enemy. The tables of Capacities, as for them, describe the prowesses that your warrior can carry out at the critical times in the battle!&#10;&#10;The basic box contains two factions: the Griffons of Akkylannie, represented by Templars of Hod , and the impious creatures of the Alchemists of Dirz . These figurines is delivered with the reference cards which also make it possible to play them Confrontation and Rag' Narok. All are compatible: the majority of the references for Confrontation and Rag' Narok will be able, in the long term, to be used within the framework of the Hybrid game. &#10;Templars of Hod include Worthy Ambrosius , wise equipped with mysterious capacities, like three R&eacute;purgateurs and their Seneshal , of frightening warriors trained with the special operations. &#10;Against the combatants of the Light, the children of the H&eacute;r&eacute;siarque are short handed: not less than four Plagues of Flesh the corridors in the search of victims. Three Hybrids represent the prototype of the warrior of excellence imagined formerly by Dirz itself. The Alchemical perfection carries a name and a horrible face: Aberration . Nothing seems to be able to stop this living nightmare which has the power of a machine of war and the speed of an unforeseeable storm...&#10;&#10;Note finally that the amateurs of conversion were not forgotten: the arms of R&eacute;purgateurs and Hybrid are interchangeable and make it possible to create several models starting from the same base. &#10;Will you be able to take up the challenge of H&eacute;r&eacute;siarque?&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Hybrid Expansion 1 - Nemesis&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Ships may fire when their broadside is facing an adjacent or nearby enemy ship. The number of dice rolled depends on each ship's strength (i.e. the number of prize disks). If the attacker's top roll is higher than the defender's top roll, the defender is deprived of a prize disk.&#10;&#10;Prize disks can be recovered by spending repair cards.

It was not an idle boast.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Grande Armee mustered 75,000 men, well-led, superbly trained, and completely confident of victory. And the next day, they would win the most decisive victory of Napoleon's career.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Austerlitz was Napoleon's tactical masterpiece. Facing an Allied army 72,000 men strong, he blocked a massive Allied flanking movement aimed at his right wing, launched an attack that smashed the Allied center, and then scattered the remnants so thoroughly that by the night of December 2nd the Allied Third Coalition was in ruins.&#10;&#10;The battle contained many moments of high drama: the French right wing holding on despite 3-to-1 odds, desperately waiting for help from Davout's corps rushing to the battlefield after an epic forced march; a massive cavalry melee fought on the northern half of the field between the opposing cavalry reserves; the clash of the French and Russian Imperial Guards on the Pratzen Heights that decided the course of the battle.&#10;&#10;Austerlitz 1805 is a detailed wargame, on a tactical level, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, featuring...&#10;&#10;1) A chit-based Command system where players randomly draw command chits to determine which division or corps may activate at that moment -- activation is not automatic. Commanders must roll to activate when their chit is drawn, and missing the die-roll leads to the Command Breakdown Table -- disasters can happen.&#10;&#10;2) A Combat system that includes all of the detail that fans of Napoleonic tactics know and love. All of the formations are there -- line, column, skirmish -- each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Players will soon learn that proper unit interaction is crucial for victory, with artillery wearing down the enemy line, infantry creating a breakthrough, and cavalry exploiting the breakthrough with a thundering charge.&#10;&#10;3) Special units and rules to add a distinctive historical flavor: the Tirailleurs Po and Tirailleurs Corse, elite battalions of French skirmishers; the exotic Mamelukes of the French Imperial Guard, matched against the Russian Cossacks; the fearsome French Grand Battery; the early morning Fog that blanketed the battlefield and so bedeviled the battle's opening moves.&#10;&#10;4) Six scenarios -- two full-battle scenarios; three smaller one or two map scenarios covering the significant actions, plus a learning scenario providing an introduction to the game's mechanics.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE 20 minutes per turn &#10;MAP SCALE 150 yards per hex &#10;UNIT SCALE infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries&#10;&#10;",

It has been replaced by DoDII, which adds the Communist alignment. DoDII has recently been replaced by DoDIII.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A children's game where players shake plastic igloos in an attempt to identify how many beads (between 2 and 13) they hold.&#10;&#10;Nine cards are dealt face-up in a circle around the igloos, with each card showing a different number (or range of numbers).  Players then start shaking the igloos to find one that matches the number of beads shown on a card.  When a match is found, the player marks that igloo with a colored chip and places it on the card with the same number.  If the guess is correct, that player receives the card (worth points) as a reward.  If the guess is incorrect, that player loses the chip used to mark the igloo.  The game is finished when one player has no chips left, or when all of the cards have been claimed!&#10;&#10;Although the appearance of Igloo Pop is quite silly, it takes a steady hand and well-trained ear to be able to determine how many beads are inside an igloo.  The sound and vibration when shaking each igloo is slightly different, allowing skilled players to judge the contents quickly and accurately.  Also, a risk/reward system is introduced in the cards: cards with several numbers are easier to guess, but are worth less points; cards with a single number are often difficult to guess exactly, but are worth more points.&#10;&#10;Background story, from the back of the box:&#10;The young ice giant has a big problem: he wants to buy fish sticks, but he cannot remember how many and he has nine shopping lists in his basket.&#10;&#10;So he goes from igloo to igloo and shakes each. In each he listens to the delicious fish sticks bouncing off the igloo walls. When he thinks that the igloo in his hand has the same number of fish sticks as one of his shopping lists, he takes it home.&#10;&#10;When he gets home, there are no fish sticks in the igloo. Instead, wild and laughing Inuit children tumble out of the igloo. Excitedly they shout, &quot;Shake us again!&quot; &quot;That was great fun!&quot; &quot;This is super&quot;, thinks the young ice giant. &quot;Now, I have found some new friends to play with!&quot; And, he promptly forgets all about his shopping lists.&#10;&#10;",

Rather than focusing on the abilities of individual ships, Flying Colors uses broad classes of vessel within each &quot;rate&quot; and concentrates the players minds on maintaining command of their fleets using a simple command system.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;Flying Colors recreates naval actions during the height of the Age of Sail, from small engagements to full battles involving dozens of ships in each fleet. Play is fast, furious, and does not require the pre-plotted movement found in many other naval games. Instead, a simple initiative and command system allows players to activate and maneuver their fleets in a realistic manner, indicating how older commanders adhered to rules of engagement where more forward thinking commanders, like Nelson, could retain control of their fleets after the first broadsides began to be exchanged.&#10;&#10;This is not a strategic level game where one piece represents several ships. Flying Colors includes 300 individually named ships rated for size, gunnery, boarding ability, and damage capacity. Also included are nearly four dozen individually named commanders, rated for their ability to control their formations as well as the impact of their presence within the fleet. The game system provides what naval enthusiasts will expect in a tactical Age of Sail game: broadsides, rakes, anchoring, wind effects, weather, shore batteries, and much more. All this is packed into a short, accessible rulebook.&#10;&#10;Included within the game are 17 historical scenarios ranging from the Battle of Minorca (1756) during the Seven Years War to the Battle of the Capes during the American Revolution and on through the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars. The battles range in size from small engagements playable on a single map through huge engagements like the Glorious First of June playable on three maps. Players are also free to create their own variants and &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios using point values for each ship. Most scenarios can be played within a few hours and two players can complete even the largest within a day. Several are also well suited to solitarie play.&#10;&#10;You can now recreate Nelson's glory with Flying Colors!&#10;&#10;",

Historically this offensive destroyed one entire Nazi Army Group, and prevented large transfers of men and equipment to the newly formed Western Front where the Anglo-American forces were expanding their beachhead in preparation for the August Breakout. The game covers the first twenty days of the offensive, during which all the decisive action took place. There are several scenarios, depicting a variety of likely possibilities, from the historical one through various degrees of German preparedness and 'sanity'.&quot;&#10;&#10;Units represent Russian corps and Axis divisions. Stacking limit is 3 units/hex. Players alternate moves. Order of phases in each movement turn is: movement phase, combat phase, second mechanized movement phase. Semi-active zones of control extend into adjacent hexes, with some exceptions. Units pay two extra movement points to enter or leave an enemy zone of control, and may move directly from one controlled hex to another if they have enough movement points. Attacking is voluntary. Combat results involve unit eliminations, exchanges, and retreats, but the Axis mechanized units have a modified step-reduction mechanism (an eliminated Axis mechanized unit is replaced by a weak battlegroup which has no zone of control, and is worth extra victory points to the Russian player if it's eliminated in a later combat).&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by victory points, gained by eliminating enemy units and, for the German player, for failure by the Russian player to have a continuous line from the north to the south board edge at the end of his turn.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are provided, ranging from the historical one where Hitler's propensity for issuing &quot;Stand Fast&quot; orders finally caught up with the Axis, to the maximum withdrawal scenario, in which the Axis essentially eliminates the portion of the front historically covered by Army Group North and uses the forces of that Army Group to strengthen the resulting greatly-shortened line in the Army Group Center area.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 10 miles / 16 km&#10;Units: Kampfgruppe to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 28&quot; map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One foldout rules folder (folds out to 10 pages)&#10;&#10;",

Each unit represents either one vehicle or one &quot;fireteam&quot; (four infantrymen).&#10;&#10;The game scale is 50 meters per hex and 40 seconds per Game-Turn. Each Game-Turn is comprised of a Fire Phase, followed by a Movement Phase, during which the players alternate moving units (those that have not fired), and terminating with an Indirect Fire Phase, during which the players employ and assess fire from off-map artillery and mortar units.&#10;&#10;Firefight makes extensive use of tables to express the strength of a firing unit against a particular target at a given distance. This strength (or firepower rating) is then referred to a Combat Results Table. This procedure allows us to rate different weapon systems versus different target types with much greater accuracy than heretofore. Another innovation is the integration of the terrain effects directly onto the CRT's. Results are colour-coded to graphically display the protection offered by woods, building and defilade (hull-down) positions. The whole effect is a much simpler, but more accurate system of combat.&#10;&#10;Firefight is presented in three stages. Firefight I, II and III.

        "description": "The Struggle between the Russian and Ottoman Empires was already centuries old when war broke out in 1877. It had its origins in the bitter conflict between Muslims and Christians, Slavs and Turks. The war proved to be a turning point in that it completely altered the balance of power in the east. In less than 40 years this helped produce the European catastrophe known as the Great War (WW I). Echoes of these ethnic and religious troubles resound today, as the peoples of Balkans and Near East still fight each other in a struggle for dominance. The Russo-Turkish War did not just cripple the Ottoman Empire. It made Russia into the dominant power in the East, and demonstrated the twin impact of modern technology and modern ideology on warfare.&#10;&#10;The System rules apply to all games in the Wars of the Imperial Age series, and simulate the conditions of warfare in the late 19th century. This is a revision of the System rules presented with Franco-Prussian War (S&amp;T #149), and completely replaces the System rules book found there. Important changes from the original version are indicated by a double pound sign (##) at the beginning of the rule. Players familiarizing themselves with the game may wish to use just the System rules. The Specific Rules that apply only to the particular game and cover military and political conditions unique to the specific situation.&#10;Units represent historical leaders and headquarters staffs; corps, division-, and brigade-sized units; and fortifications. Each unit is rated for its combat strength, training class, and movement ability. (Specific Rules) Additionally, headquarters are rated for their Operations capability to enhance movement and combat capabilities, as well as conduct various politically oriented functions.&#10;&#10;All units are deployed face down, and are revealed to the enemy only if he conducts reconnaissance or intelligence operations. Movement is performed by the moving force rolling on one of four March tables (Regular March, Forced March, Railroad, Naval) and applying the result. Combat is fought between enemy units in individual adjacent hexes; each player draws a Battle Results marker at random. This gives the number of enemy combat factors eliminated, effects on enemy morale, and special results for cavalry, and siege guns.The typical size of units are brigades.&#10;&#10;Politics are a factor in the game. Each side has a National Will Index which gives the current level of popular support. This is affected by combat outcomes and other game events.

        "description": "Similar to its older brother Jenga (1986), Jenga Xtreme (JX) is a block-stacking game where players pull wooden blocks from an 18-story tower and pile them up on top as high as the tower will go before collapsing. The new neon-green-and-purple JX has blocks with slanted sides, allowing the players to construct towers that lean precariously to one side without toppling due to the weight distribution that the new blocks allow.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as a competitive exercise where each player tries placing his block in a position so that the next player's block will make the tower fall over. Alternatively, it can be a cooperative exercise where the players try to make the tower go as high as possible without collapsing.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Jenga Truth-or-Dare is just the original Jenga (1986) with two-thirds of the blocks colored orange-and-purple and containing &quot;truth-or-consequence&quot;-type questions on them. The remaining third of the blocks are the original color, and can be written on with erasable markers so that players can make up their own &quot;truth-or-dare&quot; questions. The player that pulls the block out of the Jenga tower needs to answer the question or perform a &quot;dare&quot; before he stacks the block on top of the tower.&#10;&#10;",
