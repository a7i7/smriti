Then each player takes one or two trucks from the supply face-down (numbers depend on the number of players) The trucks are revealed simultaneously and each player tries to make a quick assessment to get the truck that is most useful for his or her supply of goods.  Players stack the goods in the space of their selected truck defined by the boundaries on the truck-bed and the height restriction noted on the truck. Players get negative scores if the truck they picked was too large (a lot of unused space at 1 point per unused space) or too small (a lot of goods don't fit at 2 points per space of goods that would not fit).  The player who gets the lowest negative score in a round gains 10 points.  Players &quot;pay&quot; points  for their negative values, and rounds continue until at least one player no longer has any points; the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Warbands consist of models, each with their own respective characteristics and points values.  A typical warband consists of 200 points worth of models, with a maximum model count of 10.&#10;&#10;The mechanics has been revised and streamlined, though the overall structure remains. The game has been updated to correspond with the change from 3rd to 4th Ed.

Each is a set of 60 figures, with 8 random figures in each pack, Giants included huge figures. A fourth set, Feywild, was announced but not released. The Starter Set released with Dungeons of Dread, contains a rulebook, five fixed models, their stat cards, counters for tracking damage, a twenty-sided die and two double sided battle maps.&#10;&#10;Notable changes in the 2nd Edition:&#10;&#10;     Alignment has been simplified. The &quot;Chaotic&quot; and &quot;Lawful&quot; tags have been removed. Only models considered to be absolutely &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Evil&quot; are given an alignment.&#10;     Warband building is no longer based on alignment, but on &quot;Factions&quot;. Each model belongs to one or more of four factions. Every model in a warband must share at least one faction.&#10;     Commanders are gone, replaced by champions. Models no longer make morale checks or rout. Models reduced to half damage are &quot;bloodied.&quot; Certain game effects may trigger from this state.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Wizards of the Coast is revising all the stat cards from 11 sets of the first edition of the game to make them compatable with the new version of the game.

The core of the game is trying to acquire &quot;projects of buildings&quot; (cards) that can be automatically transformed in buildings and protection walls (and subsequent upgrades).&#10;The acquisition of the projects is made through a bidding system.&#10;The buildings can be of four types (Economic, Military Cultural and Religious) that give different resources. The resources give different advantages during the game in the bidding phase, when you transform projects into buildings etc....&#10;The projects cards are divided in four different decks, at the end of each of them, an invasion comes, each time stronger. The invasion hits all players and during the invasion each player must defend his city. The players also can (and have an incentive to) collaborate to fight the aggression together.&#10;At the end of the four invasions the game ends.&#10;The key element of this game is the ability to plan a successful strategy predicting what will be the situation several turns in advance.&#10;&#10;",

Take turns taking contracts until everyone passes.&#10;&#10;Then, on your turn, play 1-4 of your 12 actions. These allow you to place tracks (expanding previous tunnels; you can also cover track tiles with tiles having more exits), stations, or veins (which you supply with gems of your choice). Gems (6 types, 9 tokens each) each have their own market where they are stored and which set their max sell price.

You score for stations in cities based on the number of empty hexes. Then, for each gem type, players bid (Dutch auction style, bidding for the lowest price they'll accept) and may sell their gems for VP at their bid price.&#10;&#10;At game end (after 3 rounds), players sell off all their remaining gems (with lowest VP selling next gem), there's another city scoring, and players lose VP for incomplete orders.

This is a re-release of Formula D&#195;&#169; with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -&#10;&#10;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. &#10; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.&#10;&#10;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.&#10;&#10;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &quot;Fuel&quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.&#10;&#10;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D&#195;&#169; Mini), and a lot of &quot;after market&quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.&#10;&#10;",

To do that, they invest their money in mines, mining rights and the latest technologies. The player who has the most valuable park at the end of the game is the Lord of Diamonds!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to build a magnificent park with many (different) attractions. The game ends, when the first player completes his or her park. Then victory points are scored based on the contents of the parks, technology advancements and achievements gained during the game. The player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Diamonds Club is played in turns until the end condition is met by the first player. Each turn is divided into different phases. In the first phase players take turns placing coins on a central board to gain several benefits: mines, ships and prospector rights to gain gemstones, technology advancements or wildlife park attractions for the own park.&#10;To gain the benefit of a square you have to place one coin plus the sum of all vertical and horizontal placed coins. So as the players take turns, the available benefits grow more and more expensive.&#10;Once every player has passed, the players may change a combination of ship, prospector rights and mine into as many gemstones as the lowest value on all of the counters depicts.&#10;In the final phase the players can buy new attractions for their park using the earned gemstones.&#10;&#10;As mentioned above, there are several achievements, for example to be the first player having 5 equal attractions, or a special combination of attractions. Those score later extra points for the player who won this. Also, there are several technologies, which could raise the value of woods in the park, increase the gemstone income of the player or increases the number of coins available each round for the player. On the higher levels those technologies also score additional points in the final scoring.&#10;&#10;",

The original six categories are still used: geography, entertainment, history, art &amp; literature, science &amp; nature, sport &amp; leisure.  Each category now has its own card, with six questions and three difficulty levels.  What you roll determines the level of difficulty of the question.  A roll of one or two results in an easy question, three or four a medium question, and five or six a hard question.  Play in the middle of the board is just like the 1981 version where you roll the die, move your scoring token that number of spaces, and try to answer a question in an attempt to roll again or, in a special case, win a wedge of the corresponding color.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is still to win all 6 wedges and answer one final question in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The biggest difference of this new version is the addition of an outside track, which you move a 2nd playing piece, a pawn of the same color, around.  If you get a question correct, you get to move your pawn a certain number of spaces depending on the difficulty of the question answered.  If your pawn lands in one of the four &quot;specialty zones&quot;, you are granted a special power used either to help your chances to win the game or hurt your opponents.  These zones are the Face-Off Zone, the Slow it Down Zone, The Easy Cheesy Zone, and Freebie Zone.&#10;&#10;",

A fellow student has vanished from the famous School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--and it is up to you to solve the mysterious disappearance.&#10;Play as Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna or Neville and try to discover who did it, what spell or item they used, and where the student was attacked. Was it Draco Malfoy with a Sleeping Draught in the Owlery?&#10;Move around Hogwarts making suggestions--but watch out. Wheels on the board actually move to reveal secret passages, hidden staircases, and even the Dark Mark. Think you've gathered all the facts you need? Go to Dumbledore's office to make your final accusation to win the game.&#10;&#10;This version of the classic Clue game combines the standard clue idea of going from room to room making suggestions of who, what, and where. However, this version adds a few new ideas.  The first is the ever changing board.  On a players turn s/he roles three dice, two regular and a special die.  The special die has the four houses of Hogwarts on it.  This allows a player to change the layout of the board, by opening/closing doors, changing the secret passage way, reveling the dark mark (causing lose of house points), or getting help cards.&#10;&#10;The house points are a second change.  In this version either a player can win, or all players can lose and the dark side wins, by getting all the players house points.  House points are lost when the dark mark appears and a card is reveled from the dark deck.  The players affected must either show a help card that protects them from the dark deck card, or lose the set number of house points.  Dropping to zero house points causes a player to lose and out of the game.&#10;&#10;The other two card types are the third change in the game.  There are help cards that consist of items, allies, and spells.  These are used to combat the second deck, the Dark Deck.  The dark deck cards are revealed when a dark mark appears either on the dice roll, or by moving the house wheels changing the door layouts.  The dark mark card affect players in specific locations and those players must be able to show the indicated help cards or lose house points.&#10;&#10;All-in-all the idea is the same as traditional clue, but the extra things makes the game just different enough.  People that like Clue and/or Harry Potter would enjoy this version.&#10;&#10;",

Game ends when all cards have been auctioned and clayers with the highest total of good cards wins. Cards are both: money on your hand for bidding and points for scoring in each set sold.&#10;&#10;Goods cards and merchant cards are shuffled together and form the stack of goods to be auctioned. Depending on number of players offer cards from 1 to 6 are used (eg 4 players, cards 2,3,4,5) with the highest card on top. The highest offer card is used to draw that number of goods to make the actual offer on the table. Players start with 4 goods cards in their hand as money for bidding. Players bid in clockwise order increasing their bid at least by 1 - or they pass. Last player with a bid will win the total offer. The bidding cards (= good cards from the players hand) will be placed face up and sorted by kind into the market. Also one of the cards of the offer he won has to be paid as &quot;tax&quot; to the market also- players choice. Than he takes all the other cards of the offer into his hand and he also places the offer card of the actual bid in front of him. He is not allowed to bid again in this round.&#10;&#10;Game goes on with the next highest offer card giving the number of goods making the new offer. So each round each player win different a decreasing number of good cards. When all offers are gone the open market is usually filled with goods. Than the player with the lowest offer card - the same player who won the most less good cards - has free choice to take all cards of one kind from the goods in the market. Often this is a really great grab!&#10;&#10;Following rounds are played the same way until all goods have been auctioned. Players can also sell sets consisting of exactly 3 cards of the same good from their hands whenever they want. That is no real sale but players hold the highest card of each set for scoring.

        "description": "The Soviet First Tank Army crosses the border into Germany and strikes into the Eisenbach Gap, seeking to rip open the belly of NATO's defenses.  American and German troops scramble from their bases to try and delay the Soviets, for if they get through, they will drive all the way to the Rhine.  Over two thousand tanks will meet in the decisive engagement of the war.&#10;&#10;The Corps Command system returns with a modern twist!  Asset chits allow players to bring in reinforcements and influence the battle space with gunships, chemical attacks and electronic warfare.  New defensive fire rules give an attacker a reason to sweat and encourage players to match their units to the right terrain.  All of this with the same lean, mean and simple system as the first game in the series, Corps Command: Totensonntag.&#10;&#10;The Soviets hit hard but fold fast - as their units wear down they lose initiative, making them less and less capable, and the clock is against them.  The NATO (American and German) forces defending the Gap are highly capable but are outnumbered and playing for time.  Both players are being asked to do the impossible - to win the greatest tank battle of all time.&#10;&#10;The game ships with:&#10;&#10;A 17&quot; x 22&quot; map that beautifully depicts the lush, West German landscape of the Eisenbach Gap.&#10;&#10;136 colorful, 5/8&quot; counters, representing the battalions and brigades that fought the first battle of World War III.&#10;&#10;Easy to learn, quick to read, rules. Be up and playing in less time than it takes to set up other games. Better yet, if you know how to play Corps Command: Totensonntag you know the basics of Corps Command: Dawn's Early Light.&#10;&#10;Players' Aid card and Terrain Effects Chart.&#10;&#10;Everything lovingly packaged in a good-looking box.&#10;&#10;Look for the new edition Dawn's Early Light Red Hammer coming soon.&#10;&#10;Other Games in Series:&#10;&#10;    Corps Command: Totensonntag&#10;    Corps Command: Dawn's Early Light &#226;&#128;&#147; Red Hammer&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The two players must collect exactly 11 green apples and as many red apples to win. In order to do so they will move the gatherer who will then be able to collect markers representing 1 to 5 apples.&#10;&#10;The 24 apples markers and the gatherer are organized in a 5x5 square. On his turn, a player can take an apple marker on the same line or column as the gatherer. He then move the gatherer on the freed space.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player managed to collect the right number of apples or when he forces his opponent to collect more than 11 apples.&#10;&#10;",
