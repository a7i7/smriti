You need seven different colored jewels or eight of any kind of jewels to complete the amulet and win the game. Powerful spell cards are auctioned off each turn using a fixed set of energy stones.

The winning bidder places their winning bid (in energy stones) on the acquired spell card; this card will remain in play for a length of time related to the number of energy stones placed on it. Each turn energy stones are removed from the spell cards, and these energy stones are then available again for future bidding (so these energy stones are recycled throughout the game). The spell cards give each player some resource production (four different kinds of metals) and usually a special ability that can be used in the game. With the metal resources, the jewels are auctioned off on the main board and are acquired by the players in their quest to complete their amulet.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by&#10;&#10;&#10;    Wizard's Brew&#10;&#10;&#10;",

There are money tokens now for the winners, but not enough supplied in the game to pay out properly.&#10;&#10;There are various differences between this edition and THR. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval, the horses start in a line of seven places, not all together. In the race, they cannot share spaces so a horse can only move to the next available empty space. This can make it easy to block the ones at the back and it's nearly possible to lap the final horse, or end the race before it's even crossed the start line. I've never seen a horse race where they start nose to tail!&#10;&#10;There is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 2,1 and 1 betting chips of the basic game.

You cannot remove an ice tile if it holds a truck or the bear, and tiles with dropped containers only go last.

Whenever a piece moves to a row, the guard on that row moves as many spaces towards the piece as the piece moved (if you move three rows up, the guard on that row moves three spaces towards you). If the guard catches you, the move is illegal. Of course, it's legal to make the guards catch other players' pieces... The first player to have three of their four pieces escape wins.&#10;&#10;Alcatraz is fun, quick game and a nice brain-teaser, especially with more than two players when the board gets quite crowded.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn player rolls a die using the Pop-O-Matic and selects one of his pawns to move. Pawns can enter the track from Home base only on a roll of six. Each pawn needs to travel around the board and finish on the Finish lane. If pawn of another player is bumped, the bumped pawn is returned to home. The goal is to be the first one to get all the pawns to the Finish lane.&#10;&#10;For advanced players, we suggest that when a piece gets bumped, it should only be bumped back to its START space, rather than to its HOME.  Only when bumped from their START space are pieces sent HOME.&#10;&#10;Travel Trouble uses the same mechanisms, but is on a smaller board with fewer spaces, so it plays more quickly.&#10;&#10;",

To the usual process of elimination and deduction found in most Clue-type games, they've added scoring elements.  You can collect sets of clues and reveal them to score points.

The question must be answerable with a number.  For example, you may ask &quot;How many Cookie Carpenter cards do you have?&quot;  or  &quot;How many Jealousy cards have you seen?&quot;  Doing this will help you eliminate some of the icons (clues) on your score sheet.&#10;&#10;Your other option during your turn is to make an accusation.

        "description": "1841 is the apex (or nadir depending on your point of view) of 18xx stock-market manipulation. Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.&#10;&#10;The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.&#10;&#10;There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.&#10;&#10;1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.&#10;&#10;Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.&#10;&#10;Description by Steve Thomas:&#10;&#10;1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.&#10;&#10;",

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if a Wizard or Jester (or no card in the final round) is revealed, then the round has no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.&#10;&#10;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.&#10;&#10;",

Your actor is a six-sided die, and the number on top represents your status. (These dice are never rolled; they just show your status.) After you take a role in the movie, you can roll a die and try to &quot;act&quot;, or you can &quot;rehearse&quot; to improve your odds. As you work, you'll earn money and fame, and you can trade those things at the casting office for higher status, which brings you the ability to take better-paying roles.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, you add up your money, fame, and status points, and the player with the highest score is the best actor at Deadwood Studios!&#10;&#10;",

The rules book describes the intricacies of Roman political, economic, and military conflict. The game-map portrays the whole Roman world, from Britannia to Parthia, in exacting detail, and the 800 game counters depict individual legions, fleets, and auxiliary units. The thirty-five scenarios examine every major Roman war, civil and external, through 700 years that shaped the Western World. &#10;Many games claim historical accuracy; players will be astonished at the wealth of historical detail in this one. Many games claim to be playable; players will be very pleased at how elegantly Imperium Romanum II joins scholarly historical concern to an eminently playable game system. In short, Imperium Romanum II is the definitive game of the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;Imperium Romanum II is based on West End Games classic Imperium Romanum. More accurate, informative and attractive maps, an increase in the number of unit colors and types, rules substantially revised with an eye to readability, clarity, and historical accuracy, and the addition of new scenarios (and the elimination of some older ones) are just some of the improvements players will find in this thorough revision.&#10;&#10;What You Will Do In Imperium Romanum II &#10;Storm the walls of Rome; plunder provinces; reconquer the Empire; strive for the Imperial purple; war against the Parthians; fight great battles at sea; fight barbarian invasions; mass barbarian hordes to plunder the West; conquer Gaul; cross the Rubicon. &#10;Fight against aristocratic oppression, or for aristocratic stability.

Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.&#10;&#10;The beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.  There is a large picture of the dinosaur and enough info to put a reference book to shame.  As a bonus there is also a phonetic spelling of the name.  Without the special cards this game can be played by 5 year olds with a little help.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.sjgames.com/dinohunt/&#10;&#10;",

The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in. A very hard balance to maintain.&#10;&#10;",
