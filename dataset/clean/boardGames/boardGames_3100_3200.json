Works somewhat like Apples to Apples in that a different person reads a card each round, which the other players respond to. The reader (who puts a Michael Feldman bobblehead in front of them) cannot score that round. The outrageous questions are multiple choice (A,B or C) and are based on general knowledge and opinion polls.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Players to either side of the reader are the 2 contestants; the rest are the audience. Audience members choose and reveal their answers and then try to convince both contestants to vote for their answer. (They'll get points for their persuasive powers, even if it's the wrong answer.) After discussion and debating, the contestants vote for their answers and scoring chips are awarded.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;Anyone with the right answer to the question gets a chip. If both contestants choose the correct answer, they and everyone else with the right answer get an extra bonus chip. If both contestants choose wrong, they get no chips, but any audience member who chose the same wrong answer as both contestants gets a chip for successfully influencing them. The bobblehead is passed to the left and the new reader asks the next question. Play proceeds until someone wins the required number of chips (10-16, depending on the number of players).&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you take one stack and place it on another stack that is either (a) the same height or (b) topped by a tile of the same color. Stacks cannot be divided. Players take turns until one player cannot make a move; that player loses the game and the other player wins.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Babylon suggest playing a number of rounds, with the first player to win two out of three (three out of five, etc.) rounds winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

Randomly placed VP tiles dictate the value of each port and the location of Treasure Maps, while a unique tile rotation system helps keep game play fresh. Weapons, Crew, and Provisions may also be found in the various ports, each of which confers its own Advantages during the game and translates to VP's in the end. Action cards enhance a player's ability to gain plunder or to forestall his opponents. Wind Cubes permit players to vie over control over the winds that guide movement and the order of play for each game round. But the clock is ticking on the days of easy piracy! The game lasts 9 rounds, or approximately 60-120 minutes.&#10;&#10;All materials are marked &quot;Copyright 2006.&quot; However, the game was not released until May 2007.&#10;&#10;",

Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide which units to build the most of, and you decide where to deploy them. Will this corps go to Europe, or sail to the Pacific? Will these planes hunt the eastern front, or strafe the waters of the Med? Whichever you decide, decide carefully--for in A World at War, the employment of armaments is crucial. But don't be na&iuml;ve and think they constitute the only battlefield. The struggle also extends into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy; into your own skunk works, through research; and even behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not only in drop tanks and detonators, but also in oil fields and parkas. And most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you may need to adjust your strategy. Is there time to surge-research the atomic bomb, or do you take the exigency--less glitzy but less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? (Self-recriminations can come later, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk.) For all of these things are possible, all of these and more!&#10;&#10;&#10;A World at War, a game of warfare not only on land, under sea, and in the air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on the lab bench and in the diplomatic pouch. With so many elements in play, winning strategies will always be interwoven and winning decisions always anguished. But if you hang on long enough, and if you unleash the latest weapons in the boldest assaults, well then you'll earn that rare chance to crush armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents of the Second Edition:&#10;&#10;     2800 full-color single-sided die-cut counters, in ten countersheets.&#10;     Four 22-inch x 30-inch full-color mapsheets, forming two large maps of the European and Pacific theaters.&#10;     A 236-page rulebook.&#10;     A 104-page status-sheet booklet.&#10;     A 24-page research &amp; diplomacy booklet.&#10;     A 20-page scenario booklet.&#10;     Fifteen player aid cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Number&#10;&#10;         Color&#10;&#10;         Tables&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         olive&#10;&#10;         combat--attrition, CRT, air defense and combat, naval attack, nationality DRMs&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         lt blue&#10;&#10;         naval--interception, search, surprise, construction, raider, sub attack, air range&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         blue&#10;&#10;         strategic warfare--modifiers and combat, Pearl Harbor surprise, harbor attack&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         green&#10;&#10;         misc--winter, BRP costs, Commonwealth and minor country forces, naval activities&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         yellow&#10;&#10;         surrender--resistance modifiers, British concessions, U.S. elections&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         white&#10;&#10;         SoP, research results summary&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         white&#10;&#10;         historical charts--events, shipbuilding&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         4&#10;&#10;         many&#10;&#10;         naval status charts--TF displays&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         2&#10;&#10;         white&#10;&#10;         naval combat charts--CG tracking&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         2&#10;&#10;         white&#10;&#10;         conference&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Eight six-sided dice.&#10;     One deck of oil effect cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Air&#10;&#10;         Naval&#10;&#10;         Army&#10;&#10;         Economy&#10;&#10;         Construction&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         4&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;         3 &#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Four decks of Magic and Ultra cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Nation &#10;&#10;         Submarine&#10;&#10;         ASW&#10;&#10;         Tactical&#10;&#10;         Strategic&#10;&#10;         Combined&#10;&#10;         Blank&#10;&#10;         Wild&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         German&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         5&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         British&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         5&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Japanese&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         6&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         American&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     One GMT counter tray.&#10;     One pack of ziplocking bags.&#10;     One promo sheet.&#10;     One box.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;",

There are five scenarios covering the offensives of each year.&#10;&#10;May 1915 (1st Isonzo):  The Italian army attempts to enter Austria-Hungary across the Isonzo River, towards Trieste. The Austro-Hungarian army is dug in and waiting for them. The first battles along the Isonzo are a futile foreshadowing of what is to come.&#10;&#10;May 1916 (Strafexpedition): The Chief of Staff of the Austro Hungarian army, Conrad von Hotzendorff, feels the time is right to strike a blow against Italy. He ignores the advice of the German chief of staff, von Falkenhayn, who foresees the main threat to be on the Russian Front. The Italians in the southern Tirol have neglected their rear area defenses. This and the fury of the Austro-Hungarian attack put the Italian army in peril. Cadorna, the head of the Italian army, rushes reinforcements to the front. It is a dicey affair, but the Italian lines hold fast. The threat to the Italian armies along the Isonzo is checked.&#10;&#10;May 1917 (10th Isonzo): In endless offensives, valiant Italian infantry go over the top and into the maelstrom of the Isonzo. Each battle differs from the last only by its increasing intensity and skyrocketing casualty lists. In the end, both armies are exhausted. The Italians have become weary of the war, but the Austrians feel that one more attack along the Isonzo will break through.&#10;&#10;October 1917 (Caporetto): When the Central Powers strike, they break through the Italian front lines along the headwaters of the Isonzo. German and Austrian units pour through the mountain passes and into the Italian rear. Caporetto is an overwhelming victory for the Central Powers. But Italy is not defeated and her citizens rally for another year of war.&#10;&#10;June 1918 (Albrecht and Radetzky): Conrad's attacks across the Piave are initially successful, but his divisions quickly bog down. The Austrians are unable to push their bridgeheads far enough forward to keep their pontoon bridges out of range of Italian artillery. Unable to reinforce their spearheads or maintain viable supply lines, the Austro-Hungarian armies fall back, awaiting the inevitable Italian counterattack.&#10;&#10;20km/hex&#10;4 days/turn&#10;560 counters&#10;1 34&quot;x22&quot; map&#10;Complexity = medium&#10;&#10;",

For the Gauls it meant subjugation. For the gamer, it means six battles of Pure Excitement.&#10;&#10;Bibracte 58BC     &#10;Caesar is called on by the Aeudui to repel the Helvetii. Caesar corners the Helvetii near the Aeudui oppidum, Bibracte, and forces them to attack him. The Helvetii fall back, regroup and, as Caesar's legions march toward them, attack again. At this moment, contingents of the Boii and Tulingi tribes hit Caesar's right flank.&#10;&#10;The Rhine 58BC     &#10;Having defeated the Helvetii, Caesar is now asked by the Gauls to do the same against the aggressive Germans. The German tribes are led by a very capable and wily chief, Ariovistus -- he outmaneuvers Caesar to cut his supply line, to which Caesar reacts by outbluffing the Germans so that their lines are now cut.&#10;&#10;The Sabis 57BC     &#10;Having decided to pacify Gaul, Caesar realizes he will have to start in the north, with the Belgae, the most dangerous tribe. He marches against them, reaching the banks of the Sabis (today, the Sambre) River.

They could not be defeated on land, so had to be attacked at sea. For that purpose, Caesar had his men build an entire fleet of biremes from scratch in less than two months. The Roman fleet, under Admiral Decimus Junius Brutus faced a difficult foe.&#10;&#10;Britannia 55BC     &#10;Late Summer, and Caesar decides to cross the Channel. A fleet of 80 warships and transports reach the shores of Britannia near modern Dover. But their cavalry has been dispersed by a storm, and the Romans have a difficult time beaching their galleys. The Romans are beset by large numbers of Britons.&#10;&#10;Lutetia 52BC     &#10;There are rumblings of a Gallic uprising, and Caesar sends his right-hand-man Titus Labienus, with four legions, against the local tribes around what is now Paris (Lutetia). After some up and down river maneuvering by both armies, the Gauls attack Labienus in a classic set-piece battle that serves as a learning scenario.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    840 multi-colored counters &#10;    Two double-sided 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;    One 10-sided die&#10;       26-page Rule Book&#10;        16-page Play Book&#10;        8-page Naval Scenario Book&#10;        Player Aid Cards: One double-sided 8.5x11&quot; card and one 11x17&quot; card showing game charts and tables.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Features:&#10;&#10;        Eight of Rome's most vaunted legions, including Caesar's favorite, the Xth, and its maximum-rated 1st cohort...each with its own artillery, auxiliares and hired cavalry.&#10;        Ten tribes of sword-armed, axe-throwing barbarian infantry, fueled by special rules for Barbarian Impetuosity and Ferocity.&#10;        For the first time in the GBoH system, war galleys, sail ships and transports...all in a preview of the Naval Warfare system for the series.&#10;        A much simplified command system (as opposed to the hierarchical system in Julius Caesar: The Civil Wars), reflecting the smaller Roman armies as well as the leadership theories of the tribes.&#10;        All three major land battles of the war, a full-scale invasion scenario as well as a smaller battle perfect for getting a feel for the game.&#10;        Special rules for Hit and Run tactics, as well as revised artillery use mechanics.&#10;        The *feared German cavalry...a combination of light horse and light infantry so effective that even the disciplined Romans sought to avoid confrontation.&#10;        A system that is perfect for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     75 yards per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     100-150 men per size point&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four&#10;&#10;(source: GMT website)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expansion Modules:&#10;&#10;     Caratacus: two battles from the Claudian invasion of Britannia&#10;     Gergovia: Caesar's defeat in 52 BCE&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game.

        "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;December 16, 1944&#10;After a period of fog, rain, and snow blankets the area, three German armies unleash 26 divisions against thinly held American lines in the Ardennes forest of Belgium and Luxembourg. The objective of the Germans is to push through the Ardennes, then cross the Meuse River and head for Antwerp. Hitler hopes to split the Allied armies apart and smash their vital supply port at Antwerp. Can the Americans stop them?&#10;&#10;Historically, the German army trampled the American VIII Corps and penetrated within two miles of the Meuse. The Americans stubbornly fought the Germans at many critical crossroads slowing and then stopping Germany's elite forces. Historically, the German offensive achieved little except to create a &quot;bulge&quot; in the American line.&#10;&#10;Ardennes '44 explores this fascinating campaign with a detailed order of battle and an extremely accurate Ardennes game map which covers the area from the Our River to the Meuse. Ardennes '44 covers the period from December 16th to the 26th. Two shorter one-map scenarios are included which cover the initial stages of the German attack. The Ardennes '44 game system is designed by Mark Simonitch, winner of the CSR James F. Dunnigan Award for Design Elegance and Best WWII Board Game of 2000 for Ukraine '43.&#10;&#10;The result is Ardennes '44, a game that both the &quot;Bulge enthusiast&quot; and the casual player will enjoy. German attacks follow historical advance routes, and the Bastogne and St. Vith defense perimeters are often as large as they were historically (instead of one big stack of units in the town itself). The Allied player has a chance at holding Elsenborn Ridge and making the Germans pay dearly for the twin villages of Rockerath and Krinkelt. Likewise, the German player has an equal chance of changing history and reaching the Meuse River.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 12 hours per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 1.6 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Regimental-level including battalions for tank units and some infantry battalions&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two&#10;SPECIAL FEATURES: &raquo;Night Turns &raquo;Tank Destroyers &raquo;Weather &raquo;Air Supply &raquo;Determined Attack/Defense Options &raquo;Traffic Jams &amp; Roadblocks &raquo;Bridge Demolition/Construction &raquo;Disengagement &raquo;Armor ratings &raquo;Corps level artillery &raquo;von Der Heydte's parachute battalion &raquo;Skorzeny's 150th Panzer Brigade&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Mark Simonitch&#10;DEVELOPER: Tony Curtis&#10;MAP ART &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Soldier Emperor",
        "description": "From the publisher's web page:&#10;&#10;Taking Soldier Kings as its base, Soldier emperor covers the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, 1803-1815. There are 180 huge and thick playing pieces like those in Granada, 165 smaller marker pieces, two large hard-mounted game boards like that in Granada, and 64 cards.&#10;&#10;The map stretches from Britain to Persia, North Africa to Norway. Europe is divided into areas, each of them rated for their resources, manpower potential, and defense value. Armies move along the routes that connect these areas, and the object of the game is to conquer and hold as much territory as you can. Soldier Emperor is very true to history but is easily playable by anyone with an interest in games or history.&#10;&#10;This is probably the first time that Persia has appeared in a Napoleonic wargame, but the Persians fought the Russians twice in this period and also threatened war with the Turks. They receive two armies, plus their fine leader, Crown Prince Abbas Mirza.&#10;&#10;Turkey's eastern border regions are shown as well: Kurdistan and Baghdad appear. Unlike other games, the Turkish player can't operate with a secure right flank but must worry about his or her &quot;back door.&quot; The Turks begin with rather mediocre leadership, Ebubekir and Bayrakdar on land and Seyit Ali on the sea. But once Sultan Selim is overthrown (an event brought about by card play), Turkish leadership improves as junior generals are promoted. The Turks also can deploy the Banner of the Prophet, using Mohammed's ancient flag to inspire their troops.&#10;&#10;Austria has a large army, one good general for most of the game (Archduke Charles) and a slim chance to receive an excellent one (Radetzky) and another good one (Frimont) late in the game. The rest of the Austrian generalship is not so good, and the empire is surrounded by potential enemies.&#10;&#10;Prussia is small and relatively weak, but does have two fair generals (Yorck and Bl&uuml;cher) and a good army. But if the army is lost in action Prussia's low resources and manpower will make the losses difficult to replace.&#10;&#10;France of course has Napoleon, some other very good generals, and the largest army in the game. The French player also has the Imperial Guard. France has a powerful economy and strong starting position &ndash; and a large target painted right on the French player's back. France's revolutionary ways bring its player a number of game advantages (in movement and battle) and some disadvantages as well (in diplomacy, at least until France's enemies have been beaten into submission).&#10;&#10;Britain has the expected advantages: large income from overseas trade, a powerful fleet, and Lord Nelson. They also have a couple of lesser admirals (Collingwood and Jervis) and the outstanding Duke of Wellington to lead the land forces. But the army is small, and hard to replace if lost.&#10;&#10;Spain can call out guerrillas if invaded, and will need every advantage to offset its weak economy, poor generalship and second-rate army. The fleet is good, and Gravina is a good admiral. Spain also has access to several minor countries that others can't easily reach, and a starting position in Italy that can allow for quick expansion (Etruria, held by a Spanish prince in 1803).&#10;&#10;Russia, the final player-controlled country, has a vast land area, a strong position on the edge of the board, and a large and strong army. Leadership is good, with Kutusov and Kamensky the best of the lot plus Senyavin to command the fleet. But as in Soldier Kings, the Russian player will be chronically short of cash and willing to do many things to change this.&#10;&#10;As in Soldier Kings, the game can be played with fewer than seven players, all the way down to two. Card play drives the action, with players able to play cards at any time and thwart their opponents' plans. Play order is determined by each country's initiative, and generals and admirals move their forces from area to area. And like Soldier Kings, combat is simple to resolve but contains many wrinkles of strategy.&#10;&#10;If you liked Soldier Kings, you'll adore Soldier Emperor. Play is fast and furious, strategies are many, and the excitement level is high. A game lasts about four hours, with the campaign game taking somewhat longer.&#10;&#10;",

The game is intended for two players, although more may participate in scenarios devised by the players. Each hex on the Delta Vee game maps represents a volume 20,000 kilometers in diameter. The game uses a two-dimensional movement system; the &ldquo;plane&rdquo; of the playing area represents the ecliptic of the star system in which each battle occurs. Each Game-Turn represents 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;During play, each player moves one or more spaceships about the game-map using a maneuver system that abstractly simulates the laws of Newtonian motion. Each spaceship is composed of a hull with a varying number of attached pods. Each pod represents a system that improves the ship&rsquo;s capabilities in combat, movement, and/or some other aspect of spaceship operations.&#10;&#10;Each player controls his spaceships by issuing Maneuver Commands (so that the ship may alter its velocity or direction of movement) and Battle Commands (so that weapons and other systems aboard the ship may be prepared for use). A spaceship&rsquo;s combat abilities include laser fire, particle fire, four types of missiles, and battle craft (two man fighter craft launched from larger ships). The attributes of each spaceship are recorded on a Spaceship Log before beginning play. During the game, energy expended, missiles launched, and damage incurred by the ship are recorded on the ship&rsquo;s log.&#10;&#10;Delta Vee is the tactical space combat system for SPI&rsquo;s science fiction role-playing game, Universe. Although there is little open warfare in the vast human interstellar empire of the 24th Century (contact with another space-faring race has yet to be established), there are many types of illegal ship traffic and disputes among self-governing worlds. These types of small conflicts form the background for the scenarios in Delta Vee.&#10;&#10;",
