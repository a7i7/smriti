If they manage to manoeuvre at torpedo run distance from an enemy carrier (6 hexes), drop their torpedoes.  These move inexorably one space per turn so the only defence is manoeuvring.  If the aircraft get within dogfight distance of each other (4 hexes), they may engage in a dogfight, which uses cards (a better pilot rating gives you extra cards) --it also forces the torpedoes to be dropped, so sacrifice dogfights are a viable tactic.  If you run out of torpedoes, you may kamikaze your aircraft.&#10;&#10;An amusing tactical simulation, very simple and fast-playing, with nice bits to boot.&#10;&#10;Remade in to Mission Command Sea.&#10;&#10;",

The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&#10;&#10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.&#10;&#10;2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.&#10;&#10;3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.&#10;&#10;Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.&#10;&#10;No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.&#10;&#10;4.  Whenever a player is unable to place one of his/her remaining pieces on the board, that player must pass his/her turn.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;The game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces.  This also includes any players who may have placed all of their pieces on the board.  Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;Each player counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).&#10;&#10;A player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).&#10;&#10;There are unauthorized versions of the game published under various names, including The Strategy Game, Tetris, Blok&aacute;d (unofficial Hungarian version with cardboard pieces) and The Family Chess Game.&#10;&#10;",

ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. &#10;2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. &#10;3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination&#10;4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can &quot;fly&quot; at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN THE GAME: &#10;Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.&#10;&#10;",

In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.&#10;&#10;The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.&#10;&#10;Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!&#10;&#10;It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.

        "description": "Man O' War is the game of Raging Sea Battles in the Warhammer World. As an admiral of an ocean-going war fleet you must command your ships - which can be either  squadrons of Ships of the Line or heavily armored Men O' War, in the battle for supremacy of the high seas.&#10;&#10;Players choose fleets from the multitude of races of the Warhammer world. Every ship is represented by a template showing individual areas, each with a description of the items (masts, cannons etc.) in those areas - as well as the damage that they can take before being destroyed. Each location has a value that must be rolled to hit that area when attacked, along with another value that can be rolled by the defending player to possibly prevent any damage that might occur. Ships are classified as Ship of the Line (SOL) - which are designed to move as a group of three (each moving and fighting to completion before continuing on with the next ship in the squadron), a Man O' War (MOW)- which are single ships that are much larger, more powerful and crewed by larger numbers than a single SOL classed ship, or finally as an Independent (IND) - which are used individually like a Man O' War but are more in line in strength and abilities to that of a Ship of the Line.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, players determine Initiative by each rolling a die which determines either who will go 1st in each phase - if the numbers are different, or how the wind direction changes if they both roll the same number. If the wind changes, the initiative roll and resolution is repeated until one player wins the die roll.&#10;&#10;Players then conduct the Magic Phase with each Admiral having his Wizard make one spell attempt if desired. If a spell is successful, the other player can try and dispel that cast spell if they have a corresponding type of magic to make the attempt.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Battle phase which is based on the previously determined initiative roll and players alternate between phases of Movement/Combat, each choosing a single MOW, IND or SOL Squadron and then conducting movement and making attacks before passing the turn sequence back to their opponent. This process continues until all ships have moved on both sides. Once that has occurred, the turn is over and a series of quick turn ending/record keeping events occurs before moving to the next turn. Game play continues for a predetermined time or until one side is destroyed, surrenders or flees the battlefield.&#10;&#10;There were two separate expansions to the main game. The first was Plaguefleet which added rules and templates for the Chaos fleets of Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle (collectively known as a Plaguefleet), the Skaven and finally the Chaos Dwarfs. This expansion effectively doubled the number of available fleets for the game. This expansion also included color templates for the original 6 races as well (Imperial, Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc).&#10;&#10;The 2nd expansion Sea of Blood mainly introduced new rules for Airpower, Sea Monsters &amp; Beasts and Allies as well as new ships for the Dwarfs and Imperial fleets. The inclusion of the Norse fleet wrapped up the content for this expansion.&#10;&#10;Finally, complete rules for an Undead fleet - as well as some expansion rules for a few of the other races, were included in several of the issues of Game Workshop's Citadel Journal magazine.&#10;&#10;A wide variety of miniatures were produced to represent the many ships detailed in the main game and expansion sets but no miniatures were ever officially made for the Undead fleet. Assembling and painting the miniatures gave the game a feeling of being &quot;collectible&quot; as well as being a hobby in itself. Many players have created customized ships and new ships (and even complete fleets) including rules, ships templates and completed miniatures. The largest collection of these creations is housed at the Yahoo group Sea of Claws.&#10;&#10;",

There are 6 suits of Gargon cards, each representing a fantasy creature, with values 0 to 15. The cards also show amulet symbols, with the low value cards having more, the highest value cards having none. At the end of the game, the player who has won the most cards in each suit gets a bonus card worth ten points, or five points if tied - this is what the 18 bonus cards are for. Each amulet is also worth one point. The zero value cards have no amulets themselves, but double the amulet count for that suit, or quadruple them if both 0 value cards in that suit have been won.&#10;&#10;Ten cards are dealt to each player, and the rest are split into two equal draw piles, face down, in the center of the board. The draw piles are spread out so that the backs can be seen, showing the color of the suits. Players must also hold their cards so that the backs are visible.&#10;&#10;Each round the start player plays up to three cards face down, (but never three of the same suit), and the other players must follow in turn with the same number of cards in the same distribution, or pass. There is no requirement to follow suit in general, but if, for example, the start player puts down three cards in three different suits, the other players must also play three cards in three different suits. The last player is restricted to suits that have already been played. Anybody who passed draws 1-3 cards from the two draw piles in the center. A battle is then resolved for each suit that has been played, with the highest card winning the battle and going into its owner&rsquo;s stash of Gargon cards to be scored at the end. The losing cards are discarded and the players draw replacements.&#10;&#10;If anybody played two cards of a suit, a second battle is fought with the weakest of the pair.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the draw piles is exhausted, and the current round is played out, then the totals are scored.&#10;&#10;",

The same building types and colors may never be placed horizontally or vertically adjacent. During placement, horizontal, vertical and diagonal &quot;streets&quot; emerge, and players score points when they place cards with elements that match other cards along a street. Thus, with each placement, a player has the potential to score points along 4 different streets - 2 diagonal, 1 vertical and 1 horizontal. If a card's color matches others in a street, the player scores points equal to the highest-valued card of that color. If a card's building matches others in a street, the player receives the total sum value of all the matching buildings. Players receive a 7-point bonus for placing the 7th building in a road. Players also receive one special building permit card that allows an extra or out-of-turn play and one statue card, which acts as a wild card. The game ends when the second of two volcano cards in the deck is revealed.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, a number of terrain cards equal to the number of players in the game are auctioned off and placed before the appropriate player's train, representing the next space to be crossed. Terrain cards show a number of tracks ranging from 0 to 3 and require from 6 to 10 tracks to cross depending on the type of terrain. In turn order, players flip additional terrain cards, and decide whether to build (cross terrain) or pass. When a terrain is crossed, the card is flipped face down and the player who completed the crossing receives back a number of pounds as indicated on the card. The track-building phase continues until one player has no terrain cards lying in front of their train, at which time a new set of terrain cards are auctioned. The first player to complete the crossing over eight terrain segments is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The start player gets the ketchup/mustard card.&#10;&#10;All players simultaneously decide at which table and how many hot dogs they want to sell. Each player puts the corresponding table and hot dog cards on the table, face down. They can also put down dollar cards to reduce the price of their hot dogs.&#10;When all players have made their decision, the cards are revealed and tallied up, beginning with the lowest table. &#10;When several players want to sell at the same table, the player who wants to sell the lowest number of hot dogs at this table puts them next to the table first, followed by the player who wants to sell the second lowest number at that table etc. Once the number of hot dogs from the players' cards has reached the maximum specified on the table, no other players can sell hot dogs there and any unsold hot dog cards are returned to that player's hand. Dollar cards are used to indicate that a player sells his/her hot dogs cheaper, and this changes the order in which players are allowed to sell (e.g. a player with 5 hot dogs minus $ 2 is allowed to sell before a player with 4 hot dogs because his/her total of 3 is lower than the other player's 4). If hot dog prices are equal, the player with the ketchup/mustard card goes first.&#10;As soon as a table is full, each player receives one dollar for each hot dog he/she has at this table.&#10;At the end of the round, each player takes back the table card he/she played and the ketchup/mustard card is passed on to the next player.&#10;A new sales round starts.&#10;When someone plays out his/her last hot dog card(s), he has to announce this by saying &quot;last hot dog&quot;, otherwise he may not sell them. When one player has sold all of his/her hot dogs, the game ends. If tables have become full that round, there is a last payout.&#10;Then all players count their dollars and write down their points.

This version sees the game revert back to the original Warlord with new rules to reflect over thirty years of play.&#10;&#10;Objective - to dominate the board and destroy opponents.&#10;&#10;Mechanics - similar to Risk, you get more armies for the more territories you hold. Allocation is on basis of territory held: city, industrial or agricultural.  Mountainous, waste, and sea spaces gain you no armies.&#10;&#10;Gaining territories through combat is an elegant use of cunning and bluff.  Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.&#10;&#10;Alliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).&#10;&#10;A-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.  A-bombs are a reward for successful combat, and H-bombs are gained as a result of launching an A-bomb.  These can be placed to act as deterrents against other players, and can be launched to clear enemy territory prior to an advance.  Nuclear damage however will render map spaces impassable for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Along the Soviet border, the relatively open terrain in conjunction with possible outflanking moves through Finnish Lappland allows a rapid Soviet advance.

The Soviet player must make full use of his airmobile, airlanding, and marine forces to penetrate this region, while guarding against raids from U.S. marines and British commandos.&#10;The complex relations between the Soviet Union and the neutral Scandinavian nations - Finland and Sweden - has its effects in the game. Soviet forces may attempt to pass through the Finnish Arctic, and Finland may allow violation of its neutrality or offer limited or full resistance. Sweden will always defend its territory, but its effort may not be total. Also, Sweden may volunteer an expeditionary force to join NATO in Norway even if Sweden neutrality is not violated. Finally, the Soviet high command may mandate a general offensive in Scandinavia rather than just operations against Norway, providing additional forces from the strategic reserve for combat in Finland and Sweden.&#10;Additional rules allow Arctic Front to be combined and played with The Third World War and Southern Front, thus covering all the European war zones of the Third World War.

Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan.

Centered on Iran and Iraq, the maps include bordering areas of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USSR, and Afghanistan. Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. &#10;Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan.

Now, after extensive research with a leading electronics company, Parker Brothers brings you a powerful computer designed strictly for family fun.  The CODE NAME: SECTOR computer is capable of making thousands of calculations per second.  Its solid-state memory keeps track of players positions at all times.  And its logic circuitry instantly detects collisions, counter-attacks, misfires, and hits.  A combat information center contains all the controls needed to navigate within range of the sub and fire.  An electronic readout, made up of light-emitting diodes, automatically displays information supplied by the computer.  The computer works with you as you track down an enemy sub on a nautical chart.  Being the first to sink it isn't easy.  With over 3000 possible underwater locations, the sub is unlikely to be in the same place twice.&#10;&#10;&#10;     An electronic display provides players with complete combat information during the course of the game.&#10;     A ship's direction is shown on a lighted compass.&#10;     A steering capability allows players to change course from left or right to close in on the sub.&#10;     A pair of speed controls allow destroyers to travel at 9 different speeds.&#10;     An evasive sub option makes the game more challenging for experienced players.&#10;     A programmed learning sequence teaches the play quickly and easily.&#10;     A sonar control area is used to determine range information and to aim and fire torpedoes.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game comes complete with:&#10;&#10;     Computer console&#10;     Nautical playing/plotting surface&#10;     Marking crayons (4 total)&#10;     Crayon sharpener&#10;     Parallel rule&#10;     Replica submarines for scoring (8 total)&#10;     Reusable erasing cloth&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;9 VOLT BATTERY NOT INCLUDED.

The pigs are actual pig miniatures, with a dot on their right flanks.&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first to score 100 points using &quot;pigs&quot; as dice. On your turn, you throw the pigs and hope they end up in a scoring position such as a &quot;snouter,&quot; &quot;trotter,&quot; or &quot;leaning jowler&quot; (ranging in value from 1 to 60 points); if they do, you decide whether to &quot;cash&quot; the points (pass the pigs to the next player) or to roll again. If you roll a non-scorer (&quot;pig out&quot; - one pig on the right flank, the other on the left flank; a fairly frequent result), you lose any as-yet-uncashed points. If you throw an &quot;oinker&quot; (both pigs touching each other), you lose your entire accumulated score. If you throw a &quot;piggyback&quot; (one pig on top of the other), you're altogether eliminated!&#10;&#10;The variant Hog Call rules allow the other players to risk predicting the outcome of the throw; if predicted successfully, the hog caller earns twice the value of the position *and* deducts that same amount from the roller's score!&#10;&#10;Schweinerei, the German edition, was released by Milton Bradley in 1984; Milton Bradley in 1996; Winning Moves Games (USA) Deutschland in 2001.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    http://www.fontface.com/games/pigs/ (Java)&#10;&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Chicken Chit-Chat&#10;    Heave The Heffers&#10;    Tequila Pigs&#10;    Woof Woof&#10;    Bullies&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?  All he needed to do was remove some of those holding up the first floor, of which there were far too many in any case, and rebuild them further up, so that they could support new floors,  reaching up towards the skies!&#10;&#10;&quot;Excellent, Paletti&quot; shouted his friends, and they quickly started to work.

Rex, three velociraptors, six pteranodons and two spinosaurus).&#10;&#10;The 30 cards are sorted into five piles: Jaw to Jaw, Raptor Rumble, Pteranodon Terror, Spino's Revenge and Race To The Rescue.  The dinosaurs (taxonomically, pteranodons aren't dinosaurs; they belong to a different order, the pterosaurs) start in designated places around the board, as do the humans except for little Eric (who appears as a result of a card draw).&#10;&#10;The object, for the humans, is to make it across the island to the exit (rescue spot); the dinosaurs try to prevent this, of course.  There will always be one dinosaur player, the other players sharing the humans.  Movement is die-based for both dinosaurs and humans.  One human moves at a time, but there is a die face that moves a group of up to 3 at once.  The dinosaurs are restricted to separate zones of the board and only act whilst humans are on their territory.  Like with the humans, only one dinosaur moves per turn, except that a die face allows *all* dinosaurs to move 1 space.  There are some board spaces usable only by humans and vice-versa.&#10;&#10;Combat is dice driven as well.  Pteranodons have a nasty tendency to snatch characters and bring them to their nests, where the character must escape or eventually be eaten.  Humans have the option of burning hit points to get extra turns -- a risky gamble.&#10;&#10;The humans win by reaching the far beach and drawing the WIN card from the Race To The Rescue deck.&#10;&#10;From the same film series:&#10;&#10;    Jurassic Park Game&#10;    The Lost World Jurassic Park Game&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You also deploy (by writing their coordinates on a scrap of paper) two land mines.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first plot secretly (using a peg board) where you think your opponent's tanks will end their move.  Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.  (You get six such shots each turn)  You also have five special shots which can be fired only once each --they may be added piecemeal during any turn.  You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.&#10;&#10;You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.&#10;&#10;Tanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.  Losing the HQ clears your mines; losing the Ammo Dump means you only use as many pegs as you have tanks remaining; losing the Fuel Dump reduces your movement points from six to four.

As in Klondike, players try to remove all tiles from play by creating stacks from Ace to King, but unlike in Klondike players have an incentive to keep Aces in play rather than removing them; if a player has one Ace in play, then he can move Queens to empty columns in addition to Kings, and with two or more Aces in play he can also move Jacks to empty columns. A player can place only the rightmost tile in the &quot;talon&quot; &ndash; the row of exposed tiles from the stock &ndash; but if he cashes in a joker, he can move any tile in the talon to the rightmost position.&#10;&#10;Solitaire for Two plays similarly to Six-Suit Solitaire, but the players take turns drawing tiles from the stock &ndash; three at a time &ndash; and trying to place them in the layout and score as many tiles as possible. Players score points for each tile they lay off; for playing all three tiles drawn; for moving columns of five, seven, nine or eleven tiles; and for other specialized situations.

        "description": "A tradeable card game covering the events of the Lord of the Rings movies. Frodo and his companions journey from Bag End to the destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom. The coverage of the cards is largely loyal to the movies, but it does take some of its lore from the book, and make references to certain atmospheres within the book. Some card sets, such as the Expanded Middle Earth Draft collection, have actors playing roles that were not seen in the movie, replete with costume. This allows for Tom Bombadil and Ghan Buri Ghan (among others) to be considered part of the card game. Nonetheless, they are rare, and typically you feel as if you are playing the movie rather than the book.&#10;&#10;The game will be fairly familiar to veteran CCG players with a couple of important exceptions: firstly, combat is magic-like in execution but more incremental in resolution: each &quot;lost&quot; combat results in only a wound, not elimination as in Magic, L5R, Star Wars, or most other CCGs. Each character can suffer a limited number of wounds before being eliminated, but this &quot;health&quot; rating is also expended for card special actions - there is no &quot;tapping&quot;. Also importantly, this is not a &quot;draw one&quot; game but a &quot;hand-filling&quot; game, which results in a very different dynamic. Lastly, like ICEs Middle-Earth CCG that came before, cards are either &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;shadow&quot; cards; when you play Free Peoples cards in your turn, you effectively pay their cost in Twilight Points to your opponent, who then turns around and uses those points to play Shadow Cards to attack you.&#10;&#10;As a final comment, Decipher finally saw the light and put a 4-card cap on every card during deck building (and this includes variations; so there is an Aragorn: Ranger of the North and an Aragorn: King in Exile; you can only have total of 4 combined). Additionally, there is a much more sane rarity distribution than previous Decipher products (many - in fact most - familiar characters are common or uncommon, or at least have common or uncommon variations that are no less powerful than the rare versions).&#10;&#10;This game &quot;ended&quot; when Decipher ran into financial difficulties and let the license expire.

Precedence lost the rights from Warner Brothers and Crusade was their final expansion set; the game was produced from 1997 until 2001 and is still supported by numerous fan web sites.&#10;&#10;The Babylon 5 CCG is for two to five players (or more, using the alternate faction rules). Each player chooses a different Race (Narn, Centauri, Minbari, Human, etc.) and is in control of the ambassador of this race. With this ambassador you will build a Faction, then set an Agenda for your Faction to pursue. By fulfilling your Faction's Agenda and accumulating Power, you will lead your race to a position of dominance and win the game. You may recruit allies (character cards) from among the other races, or try to rely only on your own people.&#10;&#10;Will you use diplomacy, intrigue or military conquest as your stepping stones to power? Will you rise to dominance on your own merits, or will you seek the aid of an elder race, like the Shadows? If you do, beware, for there may be a price!

        "description": "This is a game of land development and litigation.  Each player is assigned an area of the board, containing three land sections and building lots of different colours (red, yellow, orange or blue).  The object of the game is to be the first to build all of your nine buildings.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you gamble for income.  The income die is rolled; if it comes up on its red dot face, you don't get any money.  Otherwise, you get the amount indicated and may roll again --but if you roll the red dot, you lose any income for the turn!  Income is doubled once you've completed all three buildings of one of your land sections, tripled once you've completed two sections.&#10;&#10;Next, you draw an Opportunity card and resolve it.  You may buy a Town Meeting card; these cards are either Legal Action or Defence cards (this is kept secret until used).  Finally, you may improve a property (from its undeveloped state), or build a resort on it (once improved) --if you have the money.  The properties have varying degrees of risk associated with them (the Opportunity cards) and consequently varying building costs.&#10;&#10;When you complete a building, the other players may play Legal Action cards (up to five), each of which places a red marble in the gavel device.  You automatically get a green marble, and may add up to four more by using your Defence cards.  The gavel is then shaken and then held up so marbles roll into the handle; a window at the handle's end reveals who won.  If the opponents win, the builder does not get his building (and has lost the money) and the opponents get money from the bank for their trouble.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Spider Wars",
        "description": "This abstract game cleverly exploits its theme of warring spiders to introduce children to thinking games.  The board represents a web with two nests at opposite ends, and stands up between the players.  Each player uses his side of the board to move his spiders on (three small ones and a large one).  Each spider has two long flexible legs with which it steps over the web; each leg ends in a peg which fits into holes in the web.  The catch is that if you insert your peg in a hole occupied by an opponent's spider, it pushes his peg out.  A spider hanging by only one leg is a &quot;dangler&quot; and is in danger of being pushed off the web altogether (and out of the game) should the opponent push its other leg out.  Re-attaching a dangler uses up one's entire turn.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is either to eliminate all of the opponent's spiders or put a leg in his nest.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you move two different legs, belonging to the same or two different spiders.  The small spiders' leg span confines them to adjacent holes.  The big spider, the Daddy Long Leg, has a greater span and can use holes two spaces apart.  A move consist of detaching a leg, pivoting around the other, and plugging the free leg back in.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.&#10;&#10;The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion.&#10;&#10;",

That player reads the first part of an old saying or proverb to the group, and states the country of origin for that proverb. The remaining players must secretly write an ending for the proverb and pass it to the Reader, who collects all possible endings.&#10;&#10;The Reader shuffles the submissions, and then reads each ending aloud for the group.  Players must then vote for the ending they think is authentic. A player gets 2 points for each vote that their submission receives, and an additional 2 points if they vote for the correct ending. If no player votes for the real ending then the Reader is awarded 3 points.&#10;&#10;Once a player has earned 20 points, the game is over. If there is no winner at the end of a round, then the next player becomes the Reader and this process repeats.&#10;&#10;&quot;All the Wit of the World... is Not in One Head&quot;&#10;&#10;With 2500 sayings from across the world, creative wordplay and careful use of dialect are just as important in this game as the metaphors that you create.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Beginning is...
