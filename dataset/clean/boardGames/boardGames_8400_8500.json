The lead player plays a single card, then each other player must follow suit, if possible &ndash; except that a player can always choose to play a Magician. A Magician is a null card that can never win a trick (unless a trick consists only of Magicians). Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led collects the cards, then leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;After everyone's hand is empty, players score points for the cards they've collected. As in Hearts, each heart collected is one point, while the Queen of Spades is 13 points. What's new in &quot;HeartSwitch&quot; is that the Witch of Spades is worth 5 points, while the Witch of Clubs cancels points earned for either of the Spades cards. The Witch of Hearts doubles points earned from hearts up to a maximum of 15 points, while the Witch of Diamonds knocks up to 5 points off your score. If a player &quot;shoots the moon&quot; by collecting all the hearts and either the Witch or Queen of Spades (or both), that player scores no points while everyone else scores 20, 25 or 30 points.&#10;&#10;Players continue playing rounds until one player reaches 70 points, at which time the player with the lowest score wins.

After fighting different Bull Demon minions, the climax of the game is the battle against the Bull Demon King. Game cards and custom dice combine for fast, tense action and critical choices enhance the Pilgrims&rsquo; skills during the game. All components have been crafted to the highest quality, bringing the beautiful game world to life. Resin versions of the miniatures will be of special interest to painters and collectors.&#10;&#10;Journey is designed for 1 to 4 players, each controlling one of the four Pilgrims: Tripitaka, Monkey, Monk Sha and Cho Hakkai. The game's AI controls the Demons and other creatures. Diverse playing styles are possible, with a strong emphasis on cooperation because the players win or lose as a team. Each game will take 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the quest and the style you play.&#10;&#10;The core game comes with ~10 quests, each with different goals and unique rules. Do you ruthlessly hack and slash, killing all demons in the Pilgrims' path? Or take a more virtuous path, cleansing the demons' souls, saving villagers and collecting good karma. Your decisions affect the Pilgrims' abilities, skills and equipment. Killing demons may be quick but can you risk accumulating that bad karma? Side quests may enhance your Pilgrims' skill and karma, but with more demons spawning, can you afford to spend that time?&#10;&#10;Solo play is almost identical to multi-player games. Instead of multiple players controlling 1 or 2 pilgrims each, 1 player will control all four Pilgrims. There are no other changes to the game whatsoever!&#10;&#10;Many games have science fiction or fantasy settings, but Chinese mythology is a rich and beautiful environment that is under represented in games. This setting gives Journey a large pool of art, architecture, mythology, and drama to draw upon. The striking map tiles, tokens, cards and highly detailed miniatures capture the Pilgrims and their world perfectly. But the themes run much deeper - skills, weapons, harmful conditions, custom dice and the Karma game mechanic stay true to the environment, fully immersing the players in the game world.&#10;&#10;This is only the start of the Pilgrims' journey. We plan expansions for this boxed game, perhaps here in this Kickstarter, and later, full expansion games.&#10;&#10;",

That said, the game differs in a number of ways from Mr. Jack. In more detail...&#10;&#10;In Le Fant&ocirc;me de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra, eight suspect tokens stand in the ten rooms of the Op&eacute;ra Garnier. Each suspect has a reason to drive the opera singer La Carlotta away from the production, and at the start of the game one of the suspects is randomly determined to be the true identity of the Phantom player. The other player is the Investigator, and he wants to discover the Phantom's identity; if he does so before La Carlotta flees the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, then he wins. Otherwise, he loses. (To balance play between newcomers and experienced players La Carlotta's starting position can changed.)&#10;&#10;At the start of each odd round, eight suspect cards are shuffled and four of them revealed. The Investigator moves one suspect and (likely) uses this suspect's unique ability, then the Phantom moves two of the remaining three suspects, then the Investigator moves the final suspect. The Phantom player then reveals whether he can or cannot cause a disturbance in the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, thus scaring La Carlotta; he can cause a disturbance only if he's alone or if he's in the room with the blackout token. If he can cause a disturbance, the Investigator clears all suspects sharing a lit room; if not, the Investigator clears all suspects in the dark or on their own. After this, La Carlotta moves one step closer to fleeing for each suspect that hasn't been declared innocent (and an additional step if the Phantom did create a disturbance).&#10;&#10;For each even round, the remaining four suspect cards are revealed, and the players again move characters and use their special abilities, with the Phantom going first. The game continues until only a single suspect is not innocent or La Carlotta flees France for the safety of Milan.&#10;&#10;When a character moves, it can move up to as many spaces as the number of characters in the room from which it moves. Most characters can move only through open corridors, but Meg Giry can use secret passageways that connect many of the rooms. The players must use Meg's ability and the other characters' special abilities to hide or reveal information. One character, for example, moves a padlock that blocks one corridor, while another is responsible for the roaming blackout that allows the Phantom to operate in darkness (or at least provide cover for his activity elsewhere). One sweet character can draw everyone from adjacent rooms to her side, while an unpleasant fellow can drive everyone away. Still another reveals (or hides) an alibi card, clearing one suspect (or keeping his true nature unknown). Every character is useful in the right situation. You just have to learn what those situations are...&#10;&#10;",

The Invaders possess unthinkable weapons and unknowable technologies. More so, within their galactic armada the aliens hold bound a terrifying array of eldritch creatures engineered specifically to sow the chaos and destruction that heralds the arrival of their masters.&#10;&#10;The other player commands the unyielding forces of a united Earth. In the shadow of a planet-wide scourge, the nations of the Earth have joined forces to confront the arrival of a doom spawned on the other side of the galaxy. The Terran alliance is a desperation-forged bulwark upon which the invading forces crash and are repelled time and again. Outgunned, with salvaged or untested technology and one foot in the grave, the determined network of military machinery, elite strike-teams, warfare scientists, and neighborhood militias are surprisingly capable of bloodying the Invaders' noses whenever the two forces meet.&#10;&#10;The eponymous Invaders seek to destroy the forces defending the Earth and exhaust their reserves. They do this by defeating the defending forces at key locations while also causing the Earth player to disrupt cards from their deck to their discard pile. The Invader must be cunning when deploying their creatures and war-machines, or enacting their schemes, as the cost to bring assets into the war often involves the discarding of other assets.&#10;&#10;Mankind must work desperately to defend critical resources and locations from the corruption and incursion of the alien threat. They do this by building formidable and deadly defenses, predicting where the alien player will strike and setting traps designed to deprive the Invaders of key units and wear-down their options. Like the Invader, the humans need to be clever in what they deploy and how they deploy it because their heroes may be bold but they are small in number, and the Invaders are inexorable.&#10;&#10;Invaders is a science-fiction game piled thick with the trappings of war and horror. It is steeped in difficult decisions, but built upon a simple, elegant set of rules, and because of this, you will find each game telling a slightly different story each time you play. Both sides use cards to represent their units, plans, resources and events, but as this is an asymmetrical battle game, the way in which those cards are played and how they forward their owner's goals are very different. Regardless, knowing when to let an asset go in favor of a better one, how to exploit a weakness in your enemy's ranks, and where to press an advantage or feint a trap will be key in seeing your side emerge as the victor from the morass of galactic war.&#10;&#10;One question remains: Which side are YOU on?&#10;&#10;",

Can they drive the wolf away &ndash; or will they all be eaten?&#10;&#10;In Eat Me, If You Can, the wolf player tries to eat one of the other players to score points while the players, being prey, score by trapping the wolf. In each round, one player is the wolf and the other players are given Little Red Riding Hood (worth 3 points), Mother Pig (2 points), or a little piggy (1 point). Each non-wolf player then secretly chooses one of two cards in hand: Will the player sleep and rest, hoping not to be disturbed by the wolf? Or will the player set up a trap, thinking that the wolf will be coming for her? Once the players lay down their cards, the wolf chooses one of the players. If this player went to sleep, the wolf takes points from this player equal to the value of her character; if she set up a trap, on the other hand, she takes points from the wolf. Everyone else who rested this round scores points from the bank for their character &mdash; but only if they got their beauty sleep!&#10;&#10;Whoever lost points that round becomes the wolf for the next round and hands out the character cards to players as she wishes. As soon as a player has ten or more points, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

There are thousands of games - virtual spaces, in which people willingly spend time... or their entire life. A shadow looms over this digital utopia in the form of hacker attacks. The only ones able to defend the sensory worlds are Gamedecs: hardboiled private detectives specializing in the mysteries of the virtual worlds. Become one of them and investigate cases in sensory worlds, gather clues and equipment, conduct corporate investigations and cross them or cooperate with them. Watch out though - your reputation is your ticket to better jobs. But beware - every passing second leads closer to a total crash of the virtual net.&#10;&#10;Gamedec is an adventure game themed around Martin Ann's &quot;Gamedec&quot; novels. Players try to solve cases connected to the global hacker attacks. Each player choose one from 10 available game-detectives and, during the course of the game, upgrade his/her character by collecting equipment cards, acquiring skills (which helps solving cases) and improving reputation (which provides more case-cards). The game ends either when one of the characters collects enough clues to stop the hackers, or when the Net is too damaged and need to be shut down (all players lose).&#10;&#10;",

Each property is represented by one or more billboards, with the more valuable properties having larger billboards. When you purchase a property, you place a billboard into your personal plastic tower; when you pass &quot;Go!&quot; on the game board, you earn income based on the height of your tower. Reach a value of $800 on your tower, and you win.&#10;&#10;When you land on an opponent's property, you pay rent to that player based on the height of her tower. If you don't have enough cash on hand, hand over the top billboard in your tower instead but keep the cash you do have. This mechanism means there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;While players don't trade properties, you can effectively steal them through the use of Empire cards and the &quot;swap&quot; face on one die, which allows you to swap the top billboards on two towers.&#10;&#10;To date, two editions have been released in the U.S.: The Second &quot;Silver&quot; Edition has some updated properties &amp; movers from the First &quot;Gold&quot; Edition, but gameplay is the same for both editions.&#10;&#10;",

Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into well-oiled machine, and five types of cards can be acquired: Villains, Heroes, Equipment, Super Powers, and Locations. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &quot;Line-Up&quot; from which players make their purchases. Each player will always have five cards to choose from each turn, so every turn there are new options and new surprises.&#10;&#10;When a player has amassed enough Power, he may attempt to defeat the current Stage Boss. When a Stage Boss is attacked, it retaliates against the attacker! With Street Fighter, the action is often one-on-one. Players can defend themselves with Defense cards like Chun-Li's Bracelets and Electric Thunder. Each player also has access to a special Ultra card that is one of his character's signature maneuvers.

The Kestrel Dominion, descending from ancient hereditary rulers and cherishing their ancestral tradition of honor; Nova Centralis, a plutocratic nation built upon exploiting wealth and greatly desirous of maintaining their economic edge; the Sylphian Commonwealth, a once-verdant land now poisoned by the aftereffects of the Engine&rsquo;s destruction; and the Grail Prelacy, a theocratic nation emboldened by prophecies of ultimate victory. Each empire vies to fulfill the prophecy and restore the Great Engine, the source of ultimate power.&#10;&#10;In Empire Engine, players take on the role of a mighty empire, powered by rotating gears. During the game, players simultaneously choose actions to attack, defend, salvage, export, or collect resources (goods for export, soldiers to attack your opponents and inventions to score points). Players use their gears to rotate their engines, and in each round perform the actions on the top edges of their engines.

        "description": "Hoplite, the 15th volume in the Great Battles of History series of games, allows players to recreate classic battles from the pre-Alexandrian Persian-Hellenistic Age, the heyday of the Hoplite (heavy infantry fighting in packed formation). This period is often considered to feature the birth of Western Warfare, as opposed to the Persian/Eastern style, which relied on archery , light cavalry, and mobility.&#10;&#10;Exactly how hoplite warfare was fought &ndash; what really happened when &ldquo;the bell rang&rdquo; &ndash; is highly disputed by ancient military historians, even today. Hoplite allows you to test out your theories (well, our theories, using your dice) with eleven of the great battles of this era, from the Battle of Leuctra, featuring the huge 60-man deep phalanx of Beotarch Epaminondas to the classic confrontations with the Persian missile-armed troops against the classic Greek hoplite phalanxes.&#10;&#10;Hoplite uses detailed mechanics meant to convey all the possibilities of this style of warfare, from The Hellenic Law of Inertia, to Drift to the Right, to the special capabilities of the Persian Light Cavalry (Harassment and Dispersal) to three different levels of Hoplite advance to Combat (the Run Don&rsquo;t Walk rules) and a whole lot more.  We even still have some good old chariots!&#10;  &#10;And you get to fight what was the biggest land battle in European history up until Napoleonic times, the immense Battle of Plataea (truly the deciding engagement of the Greco-Persian Wars):  two maps and about 250 combat  counters covering The Greek Contingents from 26 City-States under Pausanias, Spartan Regent and General, vs. The Persians, Medes, Asians (Bactrians, Scythians, Indians and a whole lot of others) and seven Medized Greek city-states, under Mardonius, Persian Commander and son-in-law of The Great King, Darius I.&#10; The package includes Simple GBoH versions for each of the battles along with special rules that highlight the hoplite style of warfare.&#10;&#10;Hoplite is the ultimate board game simulation on the birth of Western Warfare. And it lets you see how we stack up with the latest (June 2013) book on the subject:&#10;&#10;Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece, Donald Kagan (Editor), Gregory F.

Amazing technological breakthroughs would change all of that in the year 2112. The invention of the Near Faster Than Light (NFTL) drive would make it possible for large ships to move easily in and out of a planet's gravity well, and to travel quickly within the confines of a solar system. Ten years later, the perfecting of Faster Than Light (FTL) drive would turn the galaxy into an open canvas. United by a common purpose, the newly formed Terran Confederation began to paint their picture. &#10;&#10;Expansion led to colonies, research stations, and even more technological discoveries, but it also led to the realization that they were not alone. Although no sentient alien species had been encountered, long range scanners had picked up the distinctive signatures of FTL drives. Sentient races must exist... and they must be space faring. Terran expansion stopped. &#10;&#10;Not knowing what to expect, a period of consolidation followed which emphasized defensive technologies and fleet building. First contact was made by the people of Earth with this unknown race in 2227. Over time, they would eventually call these other-worlders the Talon. It was a shortening of the alien sounds that made up their name but it was also oddly prophetic-the Talon Empire swooped in very much like a raptor upon the fledgling Terran Confederation.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;Units:  Individual capital ships and fighters&#10;&#10;Time:  Individual fleet battles&#10;&#10;Players:  2 to 6&#10;&#10;Map:  Each hex represents a region of space that normally holds only one ship&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: there is no hidden information and no simultaneous action&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Talonverse.....&#10;Talon is a game of tactical space combat set in a growing universe with its own history and back story.  This game introduces battles during the First Talon War between the Terran Confederation and the Talon Empire.&#10;&#10;This is a Fleet Combat game.  Battles with individual ships can be fought, but the game easily and quickly simulates combat with fleets of 3-10 ships. These are fleets of Capital Ships.  This is NOT a game about fighter combat in space.  Most ships in the game are large and you must balance your ships' power output between shields, weapons, sensors and maneuverability - you are not just doing an Immelman.  Each faction has unique abilities and each ship has unique features.  Proper strategy involves assessing the different abilities of your ships and the enemy's.&#10;&#10;This is an Accessible game.  The complexity of managing fleets of capital ships has been baked into the game system, leaving the player free to make interesting decisions.  It is also a Fast Paced game.  Small fleet scenarios can be played in one hour, larger ones in under two.  This makes the game thematically rich and full of quick but meaningful choices.&#10;&#10;How can the game do all this?  All a ship's energy use is integrated into something called a Power Curve.  All a player has to do is adjust the speed of the ship.  A ship's speed determines how much Available Power it gets to charge weapons faster, reinforce shields, tighten turns... but there will never be enough of it.  The game is fought on a Map - distances moved, firing arcs, shield arcs are distinct and easily resolved.  The game uses Very Large, Laminated Counters.   All of a ship's systems are displayed directly on the counter and lamination allows you to mark damage and other ship info with a dry erase marker.  All of the important information is at your fingertips, at-a-glance, on the map. Being able to see the battle unfold on map allows the game system to handle a much larger number of ships without confusion and effort.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;&#10;     Terran Fleet (10 different ship classes)&#10;     Talon Fleet (9 different ship classes)&#10;     Ships with 4 Shield Arcs&#10;     Fighter Squadrons&#10;     Bases, Transports&#10;     Unique Abilities for each faction&#10;     Asteroids, Planets, Nebulae&#10;     Black Holes, Worm Holes&#10;     6 Different Weapon Systems including Missiles that track on the board&#10;     NFTL and FTL Drives&#10;     12 Scenarios following the story of the First Talon War&#10;     Mission Variety: Escort missions, planetary invasions, base assaults...&#10;     Lifetime Score tracking &#10;     Empire War campaign game with dynamic, strategic-level decisions&#10;     Point System for Purchasing Ships and Design-Your-Own Scenarios&#10;     A tie in with Space Empires 4x&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives a hand of 3-4 cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either places a card from his hand into one of the columns or claims one of the columns. When placing a card, he can lay it face-up (taking one chip from the bank) or face-down (placing one of his chips on the card); when taking a column, it must have at least two cards and at most six.&#10;&#10;After taking a column, the player sums the cards in that column, with a loach turning the negative ponds positive and with two of the acorns worth either 1 or 5 at the player's discretion. If the column's sum is between 0-6, the player takes that many chips from the bank; if more than 6 or less than 0, he pays the difference to the bank.

After claiming a card, she either starts a new stack with that card as its base or places that card on top of another card she already has &ndash; but only if that card is lower than the top card of the stack.&#10;&#10;If a player takes a 1 card, she can place it either glass case side up on top of a stack &ndash; closing that stack (since nothing can be placed on a 1) and protecting it from being stolen &ndash; or mouse side up; a mouse side-up 1 can later be placed on a stack, and a player can have only two of these cards. When a player closes a stack with four, five or six cards, she takes a bonus card from the table, with earlier claimed bonus cards being worth more points.&#10;&#10;If a player can't take any cards, she takes a gift card, which she can spend on a later turn to rotate a die to show a particular face. A player can hold only one gift card.&#10;&#10;When three of the number stacks are empty, the game ends immediately. The player with the most stacks claims a 12-point bonus card, then players tally their points. Each closed stack is worth the product of the largest number in the stack and the number of cards in the stack; each open stack is worth the sum of the cards in the stack. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Wolfgang Kramer's Flash 10 is a quick-playing take on the Rack-O game system, with players trying to arrange cards in numerical order &ndash; but doing so all at the same time.&#10;&#10;The card deck includes 120 cards, twenty showing a thunderstorm and the other hundred numbered 0-99, with each card ending in 0 or 5 showing a lightning bolt. Someone shuffles the deck, then each player receives ten cards face down, which they place in a row in front of them. Playing simultaneously and as quickly as possible, players reveal these cards (without rearranging them), then start taking cards one at a time from those scattered in the center of the table and placing them on one of the ten cards in front of them, thereby creating stacks of cards as the game progresses. If a player draws a thunderstorm card, she can place it on any stack.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has ten number cards in ascending order from left to right, she yells &quot;Stop!&quot; and ends the round. If she's correct, she scores 10 points, plus 2 points for ending the round. Each other player scores points for the number of cards in order starting from their left stack. In addition, each card with a lightning bolt (whether in order or not) is worth 1 point, while each thunderstorm card is worth -1 point. Players then shuffle the cards and start another round. Whoever reaches 50 or more points first wins!&#10;&#10;Flash 10 includes two variants. In one, players can end the round even if they have one or more thunderstorm cards in their row. In the second, players use nine cards instead of ten, and they must arrange their cards in ascending, then descending order with the fifth card in the row serving as the turning point.&#10;&#10;",

Players place tiles strategically to a shared game board to cut timber, quarry stone, plant fields of wheat, and fill pastures with fat sheep. Players then use these resources to erect buildings on their own village boards, attempting to complete rows and columns for population points. Whoever can build the biggest and most prosperous town will end up with the biggest population and win the game!&#10;&#10;New Haven is a tile-laying game with a drafting component. The center board is the land between the player villages from which resources will be gathered. Players select from their two hidden tiles and play on this board to generate available value in some of the four resources. Once per game, each player can get a shipment which delivers a large value of one specific resource type.&#10;&#10;This value is then used by the player to play building tokens on his personal village board. However, he can play only building tokens already owned behind his player screen, with restrictions on how buildings must be arranged. He can elect to play a token face down for more flexibility, but this means a lower score if he successfully completes that row or column of buildings.&#10;&#10;Once a player is done building, any value he hasn't used is available for his opponents to use to build! Thus, the goal when placing resource tiles is to generate just enough for what is needed, not the most that can possibly be created. Finally, the player drafts new building tokens for use on future turns; plan your creation and consumption of resources to perfectly match your needs, and you'll be rewarded with additional tokens.&#10;&#10;The base game lasts ten turns, and the player who attracts the most colonists to his village by completing roads and avenues of buildings wins the game.&#10;&#10;New Haven plays well with 2, 3, or 4 players, lasting about 15 minutes per player, with a bit more time needed for learning games. The game includes a side B game board with some twists, as well as rule variants that can make the gameplay either more forgiving or more strategic.&#10;&#10;",

The player looks at this card in secret, and takes 10-12 purple chips and 2-3 green chips, depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;Each round, animal cards are revealed equal to the number of players. In clockwise order from the starting player, each player bids a number of purple chips, then starting with the high bidder (going clockwise from the starting player in case of ties), each player takes one animal card and places it face down on his stack. If a player discards one of his green chips, he takes two animals instead, stiffing whoever comes last in the round!&#10;&#10;After all of the animals have been claimed, players reveal their collection. Pairs of the same type of animal score the sum of their numbers; if you have all four animals (two pairs), you receive 3 bonus points; if you have an animal which is not part of a pair, you lose points equal to its number. Each pair of purple chips is worth 1 point.&#10;&#10;After tallying the points, players shuffle the cards, refill their purple chips, receive one animal in secret, then play another round.

If you plan your ways cleverly and have a little bit of luck, you'll survive the volcanic eruption as the rescuing hero!&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a team of 3-5 researchers (depending on the number of players) and a set of randomly selected terrain tiles that collectively have at least five movement points; the more jungle spaces on a tile, the more movement points it provides. On a player's turn, he must play all of his tiles in any order he wants, either placing them on the game board to expand the terrain on which players can move or spending the movement points to move his researchers to orthogonally adjacent spaces (1 point to enter jungle, 2 points to enter water, 16,000 points to enter mountain &mdash; actually, you can't enter a mountain space). If his researcher enters a space with an artifact, he then drags that artifact with him as he moves. If his researcher reaches a boat, he fills as many seats as possible with artifacts, then hits the water. Sorry, chumps!&#10;&#10;At the end of his turn, he draws new tiles &mdash; and if he pulls a lava tile from the bag, he places it on the board immediately. Lava flows away from the central cone, with each tile indicating the side of the volcano from which it flows. If lava hits established terrain, it covers that terrain; if it hits researchers and artifacts, it covers them, too. Players continue taking turns until someone has no researchers left on the island, whether due to them leaving the island or donning a lava blanket. Everyone else takes one final turn, then players score, collecting 3 points per saved researcher, 1-3 points for each artifact, and -1 point for each empty space on the boats they used. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, players don't return tiles to the bag when they use them for movement points. Instead they start the game with four action or task cards in hand. They can play as many action cards as they wish on a turn to help their researchers cross mountains, swim faster, or helicopter to safety, but they have only four for the entire game. The game now ends when a player has no researchers or no tile remain in the bag. In addition to their other points, players now score for completed task cards, earning points for specific combinations of artifacts or for taking a certain boat. Again, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Next, players choose a Goblin Guild consisting of 25 units. In addition to the starting units of each Guild, players have 12 draft points to use in order to draft additional units to create their own unique army. All remaining units that are not drafted are combined to create the Upgrade deck.&#10;&#10;Players will compete in battle to gain 5 valuable Victory cards. Players will secretly set up their army's battle formation behind a Battle Screen. After shuffling their unit cards,  players will draw 5 cards into their hand. These 5 cards are then set up into a battle formation consisting of 1-3 units in the first row, 1-2 units in the second, and an optional 1 unit in the third combat row. Once all players' formations are complete, players remove their Battle Screens and combat begins. Players may first recruit any available units to their army, and may then choose to activate 1 combat skill per round. Next, damage between opposing Guilds is declared and resolved. As units take damage and are defeated, they are removed from combat and are placed in a player&rsquo;s discard pile. Combat continues until one Guild is left standing, with the winner gaining the first Victory card and its benefits. Players who lose the combat round may chose to upgrade a unit in their army. Once the 5th Victory card has been won, the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Who will be victorious?

At the heart of the game's conflicts are its disks, which represent heroes and units from across the Old World. During the game, you activate these disks, flipping them end over end to move them across the battlefield, position them to attack, and interact with terrain and other disks it overlaps. When one disk covers another disk, the disk on top is considered to be &quot;pinning&quot; the disk below it; this prevents the pinned disk from activating, and at the end of the round, overlapping disks must fight one another. By maneuvering carefully to pin your opponent's units, you can strike them down, seize control of the battlefield, and win the day!&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Diskwars has been updated to its new setting within the Warhammer world and features flexible rules for hero-centric army-building. Additionally, whereas the original Diskwars was a collectible game, Warhammer: Diskwars has moved away from the blind buy model, and the Core Set includes everything you need to play the game: a host of terrain cards, objectives, command cards, and more than sixty disks for the game's four races.&#10;&#10;",

Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&#10;&#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&#10;&#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&#10;&#10;In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&#10;&#10;Official FAQ&#10;&#10;",

It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!&#10;&#10;Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Factions&#10;&#10;Each of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Trade Federation&#10;&#10;In the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation&rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&rsquo;s trade and other interests.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Blobs&#10;&#10;These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, &ldquo;The Blobs&rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Star Empire&#10;&#10;The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Machine Cult&#10;&#10;A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Playing Star Realms&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&#10;&#10;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.&#10;&#10;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.&#10;&#10;",

After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower).

        "description": "The year is 1840 and America&rsquo;s first mining boom is about to strike in the remote wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Take on the role of a mining company and compete for copper by casting miners and machines into what was known as the underground lottery. As the industry grows, so do the communities surrounding your mines. But every attempt to wrest copper from the ground hangs the fortunes of your company, and the lives of your miners, in the balance.&#10;&#10;In Copper Country, each player takes on the role of a unique mining company and competes to produce the most copper before it's all gone! To produce copper, players hire miners to work mine sites. Your miner's productivity is measured in shifts. Each shift, you reveal one card from the top of the production deck, then choose an outcome by playing capital card resources from your hand, placing your miner at risk, or both!&#10;&#10;Stake your claim by building company houses to increase your miners' loyalty and safety. Expand your mining empire by building shaft houses and hoist houses to increase your copper production.&#10;&#10;When a player produces copper, the byproduct &mdash; poor rock &mdash; is removed from the industry track and dumped onto the mine site, reducing shifts nearby for all players. As players remove more poor rock from the industry track, local businesses open their doors, historical events occur, and Copper Country enters new eras of production. The game ends when the last poor rock is dumped onto a mine site, depleting Copper Country's mineral wealth. The winner is the player who has produced the most copper!&#10;&#10;",

Growing city-states pledge to end the reign of terror, determined to take on the titans and make the world a safer place for all. Each city-state competes to attract the tribes, eager for the strength of the combined peoples, who are now leaving behind old traditions with the hope that the titans can be defeated once and for all.&#10;&#10;In The Ancient World, players compete to grow the largest and most influential city-state by managing citizens, treasury, and military and by defeating titans. Players take turns sending citizens to take special actions or using military cards to attack titans. One of the actions a citizen can perform is to build Empire cards, which give more citizens, money, and abilities.&#10;&#10;A city-state's influence in the world is measured by sets of tribe banners that it owns. Each Empire card has one or more tribe banners, and tribe banners can also be gained by defeating titans. Players gain victory points (VPs) for sets of tribe banners. After six rounds, the player with the most VPs from sets of tribe banners wins.&#10;&#10;",

By clever play of your hunter cards, you will try to eat the prey and thus gain victory points. At the end of the game the winner will be the player with the most points.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 3 rounds. Each round is divided into 4 phases &ndash; roll, play, score and cleanup. During the &quot;Roll&quot; phase one of the players rolls all the dice. After rolling the dice are arranged on the game boards. During the &quot;Play&quot; phase all players will play all 6 of their predator cards one by one. When everyone has selected their first card, they are revealed simultaneously. This is where the action happens. Did You manage to guess what everyone else will play? Were You the only one brave enough to sneak Your mouse after the cheese? Or did You like everyone else play the wolf, because no rabbit surely could resist that amount of carrots. During this phase, players resolve all their played cards by capturing dice and cards of other players. During the &quot;Score&quot; phase players score points for captured cards and dice. And during the &quot;Cleanup&quot;, when all 6 cards have been played, players gather all their cards back in hand and a new round can begin. At the end of the third round, player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The shared deck includes a fixed amount of five types of resources, which are from the most common to the rarest: coal, oil, natural gas, wood and uranium.&#10;&#10;The game lasts three rounds and at the end of each round, players check their production. The more cards you have played on the table, the more you produce. If your company cannot produce enough energy for the market, it will be fined for not upholding its end of the contract. In addition, after comparing the production of all players, whoever has used the most of each resource type is fined for pollution. To make things interesting, you have the option of turning your production cards face down, so that they won't be counted as pollution. Though this action requires valuable turns to accomplish, all of the companies might use plenty of effort to mitigate their pollution!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player who produces the most energy, while dodging production fines through clever card play, wins.&#10;&#10;",
