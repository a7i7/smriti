You play cooperatively with your friends against the system to complete present day squad-level combat missions.&#10;&#10;At the start of each mission, you each select a soldier, equip him/her with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit.&#10;&#10;You then fight your way through hostile territory, engaging hostiles, as you attempt to reach and complete your mission objective.&#10;&#10;Every mission is a stand-alone game. You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.&#10;&#10;Warfighter uses a new combat system that takes into account the fire mode you select for your weapon, range, running out of ammo, suppression, and cover - all in the same dice roll! This system creates an incredibly deep narrative with every attack.&#10;&#10;As you eliminate hostiles, you gain experience to Upgun your Action cards.&#10;&#10;Microbadge = &#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Tiger Leader, you're in command of a German Kampfgruppe of tanks, armored cars, trucks, halftracks and supporting infantry. Your Kampfruppe may also be assigned air support and heavy weapons support in order to achieve your goals. Your goals are to take your objectives while trying to keep as many of your men alive as possible during realistic tactical missions.&#10;&#10;Tiger Leader features nine historical campaigns that can be played as individual campaigns or linked to form one huge mega-campaign that follows your troops from the Invasion of Poland to the final battles on the Eastern and Western fronts. The scheduled campaigns include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Invasion of Poland 1939&#10;    The Battle for France 1940&#10;    The Battle for North Africa 1941&#10;    The Invasion of Russia 1941&#10;    The Battle for North Africa 1942&#10;    The Fight for Italy 1943&#10;    The Fight for Russia 1943&#10;    The Days of D-Day 1944&#10;    The Final Days in Berlin 1945&#10;&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide which vehicles and infantry units to use and which commanders are best for the mission. Vehicle and infantry commanders are rated for skill level and even personality quirks such as how well they keep their heads while under fire. Deciding which commanders are used for each mission is a major consideration. Your units will become fatigued with every mission. If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep fighting with your top commanders and crew and further fatigue them to get the job done, or let the new guys fight in order to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. Double sided terrain tiles provide everything from cities and farmland to snow covered forests and hills to sand dunes and oases.&#10;&#10;During combat, you get to resolve every fight with enemy tanks, infantry, anti-tank guns, and squads of infantry. Each enemy tank, truck, infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. A unique fog of war system adds to the tension of the combat as unless you have a clear line of site to the enemy, you may not know exactly what is coming out of the morning fog towards your tanks until it&rsquo;s too late.&#10;&#10;After combat, you can rest and refit your vehicles and infantry. As new technology becomes available, you can replace older obsolete tanks with newer and deadlier models such as the Tiger, Panther and even the deadly King Tiger! If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader, Phantom Leader or Thunderbolt/Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Tiger Leader.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every commander to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "No Retreat 4! Italian Front: 1943-45",
        "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Following on the success of No Retreat! Where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, and then the French Front, game designer Carl Paradis presents the fourth chapter in this game series, No Retreat 4: Italian Front 1943-45.&#10;&#10;This game will be using a mix of all the previous No Retreat! game concepts/systems, including some from the solitaire module, to depict this long and gruelling campaign with the minimum of fuss and the fastest possible play time. Each turn will represent one or two months (depending on the weather), but not every Turn will see major action! So during Frontline lulls very little combat, if any, will take place but for frontline attrition, so these turns will pass in a speedy manner. When a side decide to go on the offensive then that specific turn will see a series of moves/combat/activations (like was done for NR2); using a variant of the regular No Retreat &ldquo;Target/Counterblow&rdquo; rules and markers. The important sea invasions will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, and the long set-pieces battles (like Cassino or Anzio) will be represented correctly without bogging down game play. Like in NR3 &ldquo;Secret Campaign Plans&rdquo; will make an appearance, with players vying to attain special high command objectives, thus getting bonus victory points if the game does not end in an early &ldquo;Sudden Death&rdquo; and continues to the bitter end.&#10;&#10;To make the play surface more easy to use, the long Italian peninsula will be represented by a series of separate maps each showing a part of the battleground. As the frontline moves north or south, players will switch the &ldquo;play map&rdquo; map to show the actual areas of operations, thus saving a lot of table space. It will also be possible under certain circumstances for players to actually change sides in the game (keeping their accumulated Victory points): Thus both will be able to get the chance to be on the &ldquo;attacking side&rdquo; if wished for; historically the Germans were mostly on the defensive. The Event card system will also be changed a bit, with each card allowing multiple possible effects/events: all the cards will be useful, even when the main event cannot be used because of Strategic Initiative.&#10;&#10;Bonus Game&#10;But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, the Invasion of Sicily will be added as a separate mini-game. Very fast-playing, and will be an excellent learning or tournament game; that can be also linked to the main campaign game. Could the Axis have delayed the Allies longer on the island? And what if only a token holding attack was made, with the main landings a short while later on the mainland? Or Sicily completely bypassed altogether?&#10;&#10;Italian Front Scenario Listing&#10;&#10;    Regular Game: The 1943/45 full campaign. Both players will choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives; there is a chance that one could also be imposed by the game system in case of failure! A players&rsquo; &ldquo;switch of sides&rdquo; could also occur because of the plans or player&rsquo;s will. The outcome of the Sicily mini-game can be linked to this scenario. Players can also change the Strength of the Armies and rate of reinforcements.&#10;    Historical Game:  The 1943/45 full campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives. No switch of sides can occur. The Sicily mini-game is not used.&#10;    Short Early game: The first part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Southern Italian maps will be used, and the game will end in Early 1944 (historically after the Anzio invasion petered out).&#10;    Short Late game: The second part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Northern Italian maps will be used, and the game will Start where the previous &ldquo;Early game&rdquo; scenario stops, and continues until the end of the war in 1945.&#10;    Sicily Game: This mini-game can be played &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; or linked to the Regular Game Scenario. It also makes for an excellent fast-playing Tournament scenario.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 1 month per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 10 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Divisions&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        One 17&quot;x22&quot; two-sided map&#10;        Two 17&quot;x22&quot; one-sided maps&#10;        47 Event cards and 8 Leader cards&#10;        One sheet of 88 round markers; 24 hex markers&#10;        One sheet of 88 two-sided square unit counters&#10;        Rulebook&#10;        Scenario Book&#10;        Player Aid Mat&#10;        Two 6-sided dic&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Carl Paradis&#10;DEVELOPER: Jack Stalica&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Charles Kibler&#10;MAP ART &amp; RULEBOOK LAYOUT: Charles Kibler&#10;&#10;",

Skull King, is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. Special cards can throw off your best efforts, however, so watch how others bid and play carefully.&#10;&#10;Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five &quot;escape&quot; cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five pirate cards, 1 &quot;Scary Mary&quot; card, 1 &quot;Skull King&quot; card, and 2 mermaid cards. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).&#10;&#10;Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black skull-and-crossbones suit trumps the other three suits, a mermaid trumps the black cards, a pirate trumps the mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a mermaid, in which case she seduces him and wins instead. An escape card can't win a trick, and the &quot;Scary Mary&quot; card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.&#10;&#10;If a player makes his bid exactly, he scores 20 points per trick; if he collects more or fewer tricks, he loses 10 points per trick he's off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, he wins points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if he takes even a single trick, he loses this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, he scores bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

Typically, you may add a die face matching that space to the die you used (replace any face except Rattlebones).&#10;- otherwise, take whatever action the face allows (e.g., earn a stock marker or star token, which you may later turn in for VP; earn VP; steal stuff from other people; etc.).&#10;&#10;",

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&#10;&#10;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a new series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first game in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition &mdash; but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The ink was hardly dry on the documents following the partition of British India in 1947 before war broke out between India and Pakistan. Since the partition, four major wars and numerous smaller conflicts have been waged over much of the same ground. In 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 India and Pakistan fought in the mountains of Kashmir and on the plains of the Punjab region to the south.  Today, both sides are armed with thousands of armored vehicles, hundreds of advanced aircraft, and dozens of nuclear weapons.  With tensions high and both sides heavily armed, another conflict may be just a matter of time.&#10;&#10;Next War: India-Pakistan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and a follow-on to&#226;&#128;&#175; Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war between India and Pakistan.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of a potential conflict, only a portion of the Indo-Pakistani border is featured so that the fighting centers around what it always has: the fate of the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Special rules govern such things as the expanded role bridges play in the region play as well as the fact that both sides in the conflict are nuclear-armed nations. The People's Republic of China and the United States can make an appearance, but they might withdraw in the event of a nuclear exchange. The question is: will this war settle once and for all who will control northwest India?&#10;&#10;Note: the Next War series is not an introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward rule set that will, we think, be considered &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So, players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, however, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ownership of&#226;&#128;&#175;Next War: Korea&#226;&#128;&#175;will NOT be required to play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Units&#10;&#10;&#10;Ground units in Next War: India-Pakistan represent the brigades, support units, and divisions of the armies of the India, Pakistan, China, and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.&#10;&#10;Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Maps and Terrain&#10;&#10;The game's map represents the area in and around the Punjab district of Pakistan and the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from edge of The Great Indian Desert to just inside the Himalayas and encompasses portions of both sides of the border.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game System&#10;&#10;A game turn is generally composed of:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air operations and can significantly slow ground operations. &#10;     Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined. &#10;     Special Operations Phases&#226;&#128;&#175;in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. &#10;     Strike Phases&#226;&#128;&#175;in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, artillery and tactical nuclear weapon strikes. &#10;     One or more&#226;&#128;&#175;Movement and Combat Phases&#226;&#128;&#175;that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns &#10;     Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements &#10;     Victory Determination &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Combat&#10;&#10;Combat&#226;&#128;&#175;resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Nukes&#10;&#10;In this installment, players will have the option, depending on game situation and a die roll to secure release authorization for and use tactical nuclear weapons in the playing area. Use of such weapons, however, could cause your international allies to leave the theater, so be careful!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Scenarios&#10;&#10;There are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives while others are variations of a campaign game encompassing the entire map.&#10;&#10;In a break from the standard set in Next War: Korea(and its follow-on Next War: Taiwan), the scenarios in Next War: India-Pakistan posit specific at-start situations and objectives (or victory conditions).  In some scenarios Pakistan is the aggressor while in others the Indian side is on the attack, in all cases there are varying levels of Chinese and United States intervention.&#10;&#10;The International Posture Matrix&#226;&#128;&#175;&agrave; la&#226;&#128;&#175;Flashpoint: Golan&#226;&#128;&#175;is still present to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the US and PRC.&#10;&#10;In &#226;&#128;&#175;Next War: India-Pakistan, Jammu &amp; Kashmir is once again aflame. Can you, as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's commander, conquer Kashmir and hold it against the enemy? Can you, as the Republic of India's commander, attack and defeat the enemy without the conflict going nuclear? And what will happen in the international community while all this is going on?

Whether it is making trades for valuable information or simultaneously declassifying your research, all players are constantly engaged. This makes the game experience more fulfilling and eliminates long-periods of &quot;down-time&quot; between turns.&#10;     Player-controlled game length: Players have sole control over the pace of the game. If you think you know the answer you can speed the game towards its conclusion. If not...well, don't hold your breath! No one is going to wait for you to figure it out! This element adds a feeling of tension and excitement.&#10;     Multiple levels of player interaction: Even a &quot;wink&quot; or a &quot;nod&quot; can have meaning in this game if you are trying to learn or pass information between players. At the same time, a blatant statement such as &quot;Blue formulas are toxic&quot; may have no meaning at all, but everyone will judge you by your actions (everyone can see the cards you choose to discard). &#10;     Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty what the Antidote is by the end of the game.

        "description": "The third in the Lords of War: Fantasy Battles series from Black Box Games, Lords of War: Templars versus Undead is a dual-deck strategic card game for two-plus players. Like its award-winning predecessors Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen, the game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic tactical card battles, with the armies in this set having more heavy defense and the series&rsquo; first moving units.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged and spear units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Templars and the Undead. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Templar faction is based around a heavily armoured infantry and mobile palisades. The Undead army contains a stark range of defensive and offensive units, including zombies which roam across the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Templars versus Undead is compatible with both Elves versus Lizardmen and Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.&#10;&#10;",

Football had become the predominant national pastime &mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne!&#10;&#10;Starting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or 'Borgs as they're affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding 'Bots are on the way.&#10;&#10;Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it's hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue!&#10;&#10;The stage is now set! The fans are energized and root fanatically for their new favorites, be they 'Bots, 'Borgs or Naturals!&#10;&#10;Baseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV&nbsp;highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!&#10;&#10;The contents of Baseball Highlights: 2045 box is:&#10;&#10;1 rulebook&#10;&#10;4 stadium mats&#10;4 reference sheets&#10;&#10;120 cards:&#10;&#10;     60 starter cards&#10;     60 free agent cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;60 wooden pawns:&#10;&#10;     20 red&#10;     20 white&#10;     20 blue&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;12 cardboard markers:&#10;&#10;     4 triangular markers (visitor/home)&#10;     8 circular markers&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Gain Victory points by upgrading attractions and giving Heroes the rest they need. The highest scoring player when all monsters are defeated is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Setup&#10;&#10;Each player begins with a humble resort consisting of a Beach, a Tiki Hut and a small number of Tourists, placed at each attraction. Each player starts with their own worker Deck consisting of 7 Apprentices, 3 Street Performers, and 3 Lazy Peons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Each round consists of 4 phases:&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase I - Get to Work&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each Player draws a hand of 5 Workers from their Worker Deck.&#10;     Players simultaneously send worker cards from their hand to do work at each of their Attractions. Any missing units of work (are required by the Attraction) cause Tourists to leave before gathering resources.&#10;     Players gain the primary resource of Gold by having more tourists at each attraction, and Flair by having less tourists. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase II - Action: Attract, Hire &amp; Upgrade&#10;&#10;In order, players take one action per turn or pass. Players will be interacting with common draft areas, as well as using abilities from their own workers and attractions. Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;     Attract Tourists from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Tourists are placed at attractions, potentially increasing the Gold gained on the subsequent turn.&#10;     Attract a Hero from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Heroes start with low health, which is gained at the end of each round. Fully Rested Heroes are scored for Victory Points.&#10;     Upgrade an Attraction (Spending Gold) - Providing higher tourist capacity, better Gold payout, better abilities and more Victory Points. Upgraded attractions typically require more workers to keep them fully staffed.&#10;     Train or Hire new Workers (Spending Gold) - Upgrade your workers to provide more work, or better abilities. Training locks a worker draft pile, preventing other players from upgrading to that particular worker during the round. Training workers is a 1-for-1 exchange, keeping players' Worker Deck lean by design. &#10;     Pass - The first Player to Pass becomes the Start Player for the next round&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Any time during a player's turn, he may use abilities from fully-staffed attractions, or discard worker cards to use their unique abilities.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase III - A Ship Arrives&#10;&#10;The dock is refilled with new Heroes and Tourists from a center pile. While refilling, it's possible to trigger a Monster Attack!&#10;&#10;     If an Attack! card is revealed, the top Monster from the Monster Pile will choose which player it's attacking; typically by Most Tourists or Most Heroes at their resort, ties broken clockwise from the start player.&#10;     If a Hero defends against a Monster Attack, he loses 1 health. Any undefended damage causes tourists to be eaten by the Monster.&#10;     Heroes may dodge into, or out of, a Monster Attack up to one time per round.&#10;     If an attraction has no Hero or Tourists, a Monster will Damage it, potentially destroying the attraction.&#10;     A player may chose (if they have one) to throw a Lazy Peon at the monster, ending the attack and permenantly removing the Worker Card from the game.&#10;     The Dock Continues to refill, potentially triggering more Monster Attacks, until it is full.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase IV - Clean Up&#10;&#10;&#10;     Used and unused Workers are placed in players' discard piles.&#10;     Any fully-rested Heroes are scored - Placed to the side, each worth Victory Points at the end of the game. This Hero also removes the top Monster from the remaining Monster Deck.&#10;     Remaining Heroes gain 1 Health each.&#10;     Any Locked Worker Draft Piles and Attraction Abilities are made available for the next round.&#10;     Any unused Flair is sent back to the supply. Gold carries over to the next round.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues with Phase I&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game End&#10;&#10;If at the end of the round  there are no Monsters remaining, the game is over and players total Victory Points from Attractions, Scored Heroes, and 1 point for each remaining Hero at their resort.

The game is accessible to casual as well as expert gamers, and has a mature theme. The rules of ILLEGAL are simple, but the game will challenge your skills in negotiation, misdirection, discretion, charisma, and persuasion. The more you play, the more you will learn to expand and master these skills.

Dare to become one of these offbeat dealers and get a good laugh with your friends.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;ILLEGAL is played in two phases:&#10;&#10;During the first phase, each player receives a deck of cards prepared by the Game Master (GM). These decks assign each player his dealer role and gives him a good quantity of the corresponding resources. Each player's deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.&#10;&#10;The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.&#10;&#10;At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!&#10;&#10;",

You want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked off numbers in the same row. The deck has 44 cards, eleven in each color numbered 2-12; the back of each card shows the number but without the color. Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four other cards are laid out face-down &mdash; that is, with the color hidden &mdash; in a row beside the remaining deck of cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player fills her hand to five cards by drawing from the four cards on display, then refills the card display from the deck. Using the number now visible on the top card of the deck, each player can choose to cross off one instance of this number in one row on her scoresheet. The active player then plays 1-3 cards from her hand, all of which must be the same color. She can cross off the numbers on these cards &mdash; but only if at most one number is missing in the series of numbers to be crossed off. For example, if she discards 2, 3 and 5 in blue, she can cross off these three numbers (assuming that she hasn't crossed off any blue numbers previously); if she discards 2, 3, and 6 in blue, then she can cross off the 2, the 3, the 2 and 3, or the 6.&#10;&#10;If a player has crossed off five numbers in a color, then she can cross off the rightmost number (2 or 12) should the opportunity arise; if she does, she also crosses off a lock token in this color. If the active player can't cross off a number during her turn, she must mark a penalty box.&#10;&#10;When a player has &quot;locked&quot; two colors on her scoresheet or marked off four penalty boxes, the game ends. Each player tallies her score in each color &mdash; the more numbers crossed off, the more you score &mdash; then sums these totals and subtracts any penalty points. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;For a variant, Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel includes eleven multicolored joker cards, also numbered 2-12, that are shuffled into the deck.

One divine energy shall inherit Lagoon, and the player who best served it wins!&#10;&#10;The world is built using hexagonal tiles, and a new tile is drawn from a bag each time a druid explores a site. Site tiles are double-sided, and each side represents a different mystical site offering a unique magical power to the druids. Each site is also enchanted with one of three divine energies: Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin. Since the two sides of a site tile are always linked to different energies, every site explored presents a choice of which energy to advance over the other two, as well as what magic will be put into the world for use by the druids. Players also strategically deploy their druids to unravel sites aligned with an energy they choose to oppose, removing such sites from the world and tipping the balance of power towards the other two energies.&#10;&#10;The energy with the most sites in play at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny, and the player who most supported that dominant energy is the winner. Support is tracked in two ways. First, whenever exploring a site and expanding an energy's reach in Lagoon, the exploring player gains a divine seed token matching the explored site's energy. These seeds can be spent in various ways over the course of the game, but any seeds of the dominant energy remaining in a player's supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it is removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.&#10;&#10;",

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!&#10;&#10;Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.&#10; The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.&#10;&#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&#10;&#10;In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&#10; You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!&#10;&#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!&#10;&#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&#10;&#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as 'add ons.'

Each player has a hand of these cards with the remainder making up the deck.

A card is drawn from the deck for each player, who must then pair it with an opposite card from their hand.&#10;&#10;In the voting round, each player has a funny token and a die token with identical backs. Players place a funny token on the funniest pair and a die token on the least funny (players may not vote for themselves). A tie leads to a run-off vote. The tokens are flipped up and the player with the most funny tokens takes the money wagered. The next player then rolls the die for a new round.&#10;&#10;When a player loses all their money, the game ends. The player with the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

When a player has amassed enough Power, he may defeat more powerful enemies from the &quot;Archenemy&quot; deck, including Shelob, The Witch-King, and the Eye of Sauron! Each card acquired during the game has a Victory Point (VP) value with the Archenemy cards providing the most VPs.

In this game, players take turns playing the part of the industrious ants and the grasshopper content to sponge off the labor of the ants.&#10;&#10;The Grasshopper &amp; the Ant includes two ways to play, but the heart of both is the same. At the start of the game, lay out 16 (of the 48) path cards in a 4x4 grid; each path card shows one of four types of landscapes. The ant player places six ants on these cards, one ant per card, with the ants forming a chain (as in real life), then secretly chooses one type of terrain on which at least one ant stands. The grasshopper player then stands with one of the ants, and if the grasshopper chose the same landscape as the ant player, the grasshopper takes all the path cards of this type on which an ant stands; if the grasshopper chose incorrectly, then the ant player takes these path cards. Either way, you then refill the 4x4 grid. The ant player keeps playing until she finally wins path cards, then the next player in clockwise order controls the ants. (In winter mode, the third and fourth players control red ants and receive a random path card if they match the choice of the ant player.)&#10;&#10;In autumn mode, players score path cards immediately, with each type being tracked independently; path cards that feature insects are saved for a endgame bonus. As soon as a player maxes out two scoring tracks, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In winter mode, players keep the path cards they collect in order to buy provision cards (worth one victory point), which cost particular combinations of path types. In this mode, when you win a path card that features an insect, you can claim another card in the grid that features the same insect. Collect both provision cards of the same type, and you score a bonus VP. The first player to collect 4 VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player plays one die card (which shows values from 1 to 6), then either starts a new row of cards or adds to an existing row.&#10;&#10;&#10;    To start a new row, take the card showing this number from the display and place it in front of you; when starting a row, you can choose to play both die cards instead of only one.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    To add to a row, add the die value played to the number on the top card of one of your rows, then take this card from the display.&#10;&#10;&#10;If another player has used a desired card in one of her rows, steal it from her row and use it for yourself. You can have at most three rows in progress. At the end of your turn draw back up to two die cards.&#10;&#10;When you play a die card to place the 40 card on a row, you then score the row, earning one point for each card in the row plus one point for each star on cards in that row. Record this score on paper, then return these cards to the display.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player scores 30, 35, or 40 points, with this total being dependent on the number of players: 2, 3, or 4.&#10;&#10;",

Scrimmage games are the quickest, using identical rookie teams and a subset of the rules to help you learn how to play the game.

League games add support staff and let you improve your team over a full season of games.&#10;&#10;The game includes rules for risk-based scoring, penalties, injuries, mascots, cheerleaders, physicians, assistant coaches, mavericks, 50 player skills (like Savagery and Immaculate Reception), 70 strategy cards (like Epic Fail and No Time to Bleed), and more. All of this adds up to enough strategic options to fuel hours and hours of thrilling victories and agonizing defeats.&#10;&#10;",

When evil gets all fancy, they break that biz down...for hope!&#10;&#10;In the Bravest Warriors Co-operative Dice Game, you take on the role of one of the Bravest Warriors or one of their best pals. Working together, you'll try to overcome Events and Encounters seen in Bravest Warriors episodes using your Portals and Special Abilities. Encounters require various symbols to beat them, and those symbols are found on the twelve custom dice, which are divided up between the players as evenly as possible. Each player rolls her own dice, but once rolled the dice are pooled together to use them as best you can as a team. If you don't roll what you need, you can play Portal cards (as seen in the &quot;Sugarbellies&quot; episode of the show) or use your character's Special Abilities. Conversion Portals, Re-Roll Portals, Gift Portals and more can make the difference between success and failure.&#10;&#10;When you fail a challenge, the team suffers a calamity and the Encounter is placed into the Failed! pile. If you fail five Encounters, you lose the game! If you run out of Portal cards, you lose the game! If too many Bravest Warriors get K.O.ed, you lose the game! But if you score enough Victory Points or use up all of the Event cards, your team wins! (The actual number of VPs needed to win depends on whether you're playing easy mode (for younger or new players) or standard mode.)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In the late 19th Century the land of Transylvania fell under a terrible curse allowing Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies to terrorize the citizens.  The Governor issued a desperate plea for help.  You play one of the best and bravest Adventurers in the world called to Transylvania to break the curse.  Your goal is to find the Knowledge to break the curse over Transylvania but beware, the Knowledge you seek may just turn you into one of the terrible Monsters you have come to destroy.&#10;&#10;Transylvania: Curses &amp; Traitors is a heavily themed adventure and exploration game utilizing a modular board, variable player powers, hand management, and dice rolling.&#10;&#10;Paths to victory include:  1. Solving the curse of Transylvania by finding the right combination of Knowledge cards and returning your pawn to the Church Tile.  2.  Becoming a Monster (vampire, werewolf, or zombie) by collecting Transformation cards and then killing half the other players.  3. Killing a Monster as an Adventurer.&#10;&#10;Game play:  The board consists of sixteen 6&quot; x 6&quot; tiles representing places in Transylvania such as the Church, Graveyard, and Castle.  Adventurers start on the Church Tile and explore uncovering new tiles.  Each tile contains token spaces which are opportunities to perform challenges of strength, mental acuity, and spiritual fortitude.  A successful challenge results in the reward of a Quest card.  The Quest deck contains the Knowledge cards needed to break the curse.  While exploring Adventurers will also encounter Events.  Failure of Events leads to injury and/or death while success leads to additional rewards.  If Adventurers collect Transformation cards plus a card that activates the Transformation card, they become a Vampire, Werewolf, or Zombie.  The goal of the game immediately changes from seeking Knowledge to eliminating the other players by attacking them.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Livestock Uprising",
        "description": "Livestock Uprising is a tactical resource management game in which you harvest farmland, marshal animal armies, and battle for control of the farm. Each player takes control of one of the four animal factions: pigs, goats, cows, or chickens. Each faction has its own barn and special attributes that impact gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each faction has three Generals that move around the farm harvesting crops and marshaling troops. Initially, the Generals can harvest only the least valuable resource: grass. Players must spend their resources in order to marshal new troops, which unlock the ability to harvest better resources, e.g., a donkey allows its General to harvest corn. Players work their way toward harvesting the most scarce resources so they can marshal the most powerful troops. Each General can command only five Troops, so players often specialize the Generals based on their location, nearby threats, and distance from their barn.&#10;&#10;The farm is an 8x8 randomly tiled board containing crops, obstacles, and empty fields. When setting up the board, a small 4x4 grid is laid out randomly, and each player positions his barn anywhere along the perimeter of the grid. The rest of tiles are then randomly laid down to form the final 8x8 board. When choosing a starting location, players must consider the available resources, distance to neighbors, and the faction's special abilities.&#10;&#10;In addition to the common Troops, each faction may also marshal Special Forces. Each Special Force Troop gives the faction a distinct advantage: chickens gain a movement bonus, cows gain a defensive bonus, pigs gain a harvesting bonus, and goats gain an attacking bonus. Players also have three hidden Command Cards that they may play at any time to gain an advantage or get out of a tough situation. The Command Cards range in effects and are very valuable when used appropriately.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to destroy the other factions and take control of the farm. Players achieve this by forming a Super Army and triggering the end game. At any time a player may choose to form a Super Army if all of their General are in their barn. The Super Army combines all of the player&rsquo;s Troops together under a single General. This massive army gets an attack, defense, and movement bonus, but cannot harvest resources or marshal Troops. Forming a Super Army triggers the end game as the only effective strategy against a Super Army is to form one of your own. The Super Armies then drop the gloves and battle it out for all or nothing victory.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Pick-a-Seal features the same gameplay as Pick-a-Polar Bear, but without the two variants of that game. An individual game supports 2-5 players, while combined the two games support up to eight players.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out 30 cards in a grid (49 cards with 6-8 players) and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, with/without a raised arm, orange autumn/blue winter background, with/without goggles, and with/without canned fish. Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot; The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.&#10;&#10;To set up for the next round, give each player a new face-down card and fill in the holes in the grid. When the deck runs out, complete that round, after which the game ends.
