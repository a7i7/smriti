Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex.

As with most modern warfare games, Fifth Corps includes rules for airpower, airmobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare. The game includes three scenarios: an introductory &quot;Rhein-Main Raid&quot;, a more advanced &quot;The Battle for Fulda&quot;, and the campaign game, &quot;Fifth Corps&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Rhein-Main Raid Scenario: Three days after the next war began, the Soviets had not crossed into the Fulda/Frankfurt area. All Warsaw Pact lines of advance had been to the north and south of Fifth Corp's area of operations.Thus, NATO vacated the area to reinforce other hard hit sectors. NATO was surprised then, when two Soviet motorized rifle divisions entered the Fulda Gap supported by attack helicopters, aiming to seize a NATO nuclear site at Giessen, the Wiesbaden Airfield, and the critical Rhein-Main Airbase... A mobile, confusing engagement ensured, independent of the major battles along the rest of the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Battle for Fulda Scenario: At the outbreak of the next war, few areas were harder hit than the Fulda Gap. Here an entire Soviet Army and various support units, including an airborne regiment, were committed on the first day... Those [NATO support units] that survived were ordered to &quot;contain all enemy breakouts&quot; until the arrival of the 5th Panzer Division.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fifth Corps Scenario: Following the initial attack by 8th Guards Army, the Soviets sought to seal the fate of NATO in the Fulda/Frankfurt area by committing the 1st Guards Tank Army to the action...

When completely addressed, the game is a War College-level education on the conduct of World War III operations at Division/Brigade level between NATO and Soviet forces. The game system builds on the combat-as-part-of-movement late-SPI systems such as Next War and Fifth Corps, and has as one of its basic premises the idea that unit strength is subordinate to tactical and command considerations.&#10;&#10;Central to its uniqueness, NATO Division Commander contains two identical mapboards and rules for Controller play, producing a refereed, double-blind, fog-of-war effect which is still unique today, more than 30 years after publication.  The game includes solitaire and face-to-face rules to help controllers build up their knowledge of the game, and decide what they will include, and what slows the game down too much for their taste: thus allowing the game experience to be controlled for the players' experience and expectations. It also allows testing of scenarios before controller use.&#10;&#10;Scenarios are comprehensive and infinitely flexible, which makes demands of controllers, and offer a unique playing experience for those peering down the gun barrel.&#10;&#10;With 1200 counters, rule books, and a pile of playing aids, NATO Division Commander still is, the one true smorgasbord of World War III land-based operational simulations.&#10;&#10;",

The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).&#10;&#10;As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &quot;good old days&quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.&#10;&#10;The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player (in contrast with maps from games like The Gamers' &quot;Thunder at the Crossroads&quot;, where the vibrant color can make you cross-eyed). Hues of gray and green predominate. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.&#10;&#10;The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.&#10;&#10;In yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment. The system adds a level of uncertainty to the game that leads to unexpected combat results and tempers any tendency to attack without some forethought.&#10;&#10;Although primarily designed for two players, the game can accommodate up to four given its size and attention to detail.

It focuses on the fighting in the southern sector of the battle zone, where German panzer and parachute divisions drove on the key crossroads of Bastogne. American infantry, armor and paratroopers initially gave way, but rallied, held, and drove the Germans back.&#10;&#10;The game includes 51 scenarios, ranging in size from small ones playable in well under an hour to large tank battles. There are 465 game pieces, representing tank and infantry platoons, artillery batteries, and individual leaders. The game also includes four geomorphic game boards showing typical terrain from the Ardennes region where the battle took place. These boards were hard-mounted in the original printing of the game, but more recent printings include updated boards in the current, semi-rigid style.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Alaska's War&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Arctic Front Deluxe Edition&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Blue Division&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Edelweiss&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: First Axis&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Fronte Russo&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Curtain&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Wolves&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Jungle Fighting&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: North Wind&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Red Warriors&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Secret Weapons&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Sinister Forces&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: White Eagles&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Winter Soldiers&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Twenty-four scenarios are included. Guadalcanal is a stand-alone game; no other game from the series is required to play any of the 24 scenarios.&#10;&#10;Guadalcanal introduces several types of Marine units: Marine rifle, parachute and Raider units plus scouts. The Marines usually have very good morale, and have excellent leadership and strong firepower. Where they&rsquo;re at time lacking is in support weapons: The Army gets first call on tanks and artillery, and the Marine versions on Guadalcanal are not up to the high quality of the riflemen.&#10;&#10;Japan counters with Army and navy units of low firepower but fanatically high morale. Japanese artillery isn&rsquo;t very good, their handful of tanks will barely keep out rifle bullets, and there are few direct support weapons. The key to Japanese success will be to enter close combat with the Marines, where the Japanese warrior spirit can be used to full advantage.&#10;&#10;Scenarios cover a wide variety of actions. The maps, thought by many to be the most beautiful in the Panzer Grenadier series, cover &ldquo;historical&rdquo; terrain rather than the generic coverage of most other games in the series.&#10;&#10;",

That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond.&quot; This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.&#10;&#10;To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;To the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side.

In their despair, colonies revolted, workers ran from their jobs and soldiers abandoned their posts in an attempt to flee the approaching darkness.&#10;&#10;It was days before any news came to them.

As one, the hub satellites flickered into life; suddenly and strangely, for the words were not sent by the peoples to one another, but to all six peoples from the the vanished planet Earth!&#10;&#10;Bizarre blueprints for wondrous new technologies were transmitted and strange instructions were given, both for the banishment of the Creature and the formation of a new system for Earth to use when it returned.

        "description": "GOLO Golf dice is played with 9 12-sided dice that represent the 9 holes on the front (or the back) of an 18-hole traditional golf course. There are 5 white dice (par 4s), 2 red dice (par 3's) and 2 blue dice (par 5s). Each dice has the ability to shoot above par, par, or below par. There are as many formats as there are golf side games, but players typically play in one of two formats:&#10;&#10;Traditional Format:&#10;&#10;All nine dice are rolled--the player chooses at least 1 die, but can use more than one to count toward his/her 9-hole total. The remaining dice are picked up and rolled again. Players have the option of having multiple dice count toward their score, or choose as few as one and try to &quot;GO LO&quot; (shoot a low score--golf parlance).&#10;&#10;Golf Course Format:&#10;&#10;In this format, the players must follow along to the scorecard of their favorite course, or any course. If the first 9 holes (&quot;Front 9&quot;) at Pebble Beach are laid out in this order--4-4-3-4-5-3-4-4-5=36, then when the player begins by rolling all 9 dice, he/she must play the course &quot;in order&quot; by choosing two par 4's before he/she may then chose a par 3. Having to go in the order of holes on a golf course creates a different strategy and usually produces higher scores than the Traditional format.&#10;&#10;In all formats, tournament play is the most exciting--where players are playing against each other, and their scores are affecting other players' choices and strategies.&#10;&#10;A game primarily for non-gamers and sports nuts, which nevertheless is a very strategic, &quot;push-your-luck&quot; dice game. It is not just a matter of rolling dice and counting up your score; the requirement of keeping one or more dice each time you roll presents many interesting choices, depending on what your opponent has done, and what you already have kept for scoring.&#10;&#10;The game is sold online at www.igolo.com and in major golf shops and golf stores. Game includes a cup, nine dice, score pad, pencil, and rulebook.&#10;&#10;",

It pits Manstein&rsquo;s Army Group South against the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts in three encirclement battles&mdash;Kirovograd, Korsun, and Kamenets-Podoliskiy. Both sides confront difficult strategic and tactical problems. The still potent German army holds a vulnerable position. Poor logistics happers the maturing Red Army.&#10;&#10;However, the game attempts to portray the logistical weakness of the Red Army at this time in the war, and make it a challenge for the Soviet player to keep the Germans encircled or even just on the run. The game also attempts to portray Hitler's &quot;no retreat&quot; mandate (via the victory conditions), and thus limit the German player's ability to conduct a mobile defense.&#10;&#10;Contains &quot;series rules&quot; shared by every game in the series and game-specific rules unique to itself.&#10;&#10;OCS games emphasize supply management and mobility as primary aspects of operational combat (i.e. at the unit scale of battalion/regiment/division) in WWII.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Six dual-side printed countersheets (4 combat, 2 markers - 1,540 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 40-page OCS version 2.0i rules booklet&#10;One 24-page Hube's Pocket specific rules booklet&#10;Two 4-sided OCS v2.0i Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 10-100 Hours&#10;&#10;",

Other changes:&#10;- The banknotes design is different: In the centre is a maple leave and to it's left and right is a space showing the name of the sponsor Royal Bank.&#10;-Community chest and chance are replaced with bilingual 'Provincial' cards (red) and 'Federal' cards (yellow), both showing the same skyline picture as the box lid. They all show funny drawings with Mr. Monopoly (as Rich Uncle Pennybags will be called from 2000 onwards). &#10;The text on some of these cards have been adapted to uniquely Canadian situations.&#10;&#10;For the 2010 'Electronic Banking' edition of the game, an online contest was conducted in which participants were asked to vote for cities to be on the new board.

Each player starts with two piles of eleven cards.  One pile is their hand, the other, their foot.  The players draw two cards a turn, playing some if they choose and then discarding one at the end of each of their turns, except if they want to go out, when they will have to play every card.  Once a player has played all the cards in their hand they will pick up their foot.  Sets are comprised of 7 cards of the same number.  Sets may have wild cards in them, jokers and twos, but then the set is no longer clean, it would then be considered dirty.  A team needs two clean sets and two or three dirty sets to go out.&#10;&#10;Hand and Foot is also commonly known as clean and dirty.&#10;&#10;",

The hoppers move 1, 2, or 3 spaces, depending if they jump from a water space, a flower or a leaf. The hoppers move forward to empty spaces, but can jump backwards if they are taking an opponents' piece. Captured pieces are also worth 1 pt each.&#10;&#10;When the board is laid out, the players sit at opposing corners, so the hoppers move orthogonally on the board, but diagonally to the players' view. This can distract you such that you don't quite recognize when a capture might happen.&#10;&#10;One of the best features of Subulata is that one hopper may threaten other hoppers without being at risk itself. This allows you to build an attack from which there is no defense. As the game opens, you might choose to move to attack, or try to slip by safely. But that leaves your home free to be occupied.
