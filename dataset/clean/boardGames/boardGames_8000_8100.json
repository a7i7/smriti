        "description": "Red Code instructions.&#10;&#10;1.0.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Red Code, a board game where you take control of a WWII military ship. Re-live epic battles with your family and friends. Manage your crew to carry out manoeuvres with your ship, attack the other players&rsquo; ships and co-operate with players in your faction to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;1.1. Characteristics:&#10;The players play 1 on 1, or combine into 2 factions of 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3. The game takes about 45 minutes and is for players over 8 years old.&#10;&#10;1.2. Prologue:&#10;The game combines simple mechanics, the placement of crew, to choose different manoeuvres. Take advantage of the possibilities offered by the terrain and your boat to sink the enemy.&#10;&#10;2.0. Objective of the game:&#10;&#10;2.1. Arena mode&#10;&#10;The first group to sink the enemy ships is the winner. You don&rsquo;t use the score card for this mode, as the sinking of all the enemy&rsquo;s ships implies that the enemy player has been eliminated.&#10;&#10;(Games of 2 vs 2) The first side to lose a ship receives 2 order cards. There is no effect for ships sunk after that.&#10;&#10;(Games of 3 vs 3) The first side to lost 2 ships receives 2 order cards between the players of that side. In other words the first team to be reduced to just 1 ship will receive 2 order cards. There is no effect when other teams are reduced to 1 ship later.&#10;&#10;2.2. War mode&#10;&#10;The first side to get 5 victory points is the winner. Sinking an enemy ship earns you 1 victory point. This is shown by advancing your score token on the score card by 1 position.&#10;&#10;When a ship is sunk, it is returned to the beginning map card and flipped over to show that it will miss the next turn. When the ship is restored after being sunk, it is fully restored (crew, repairs and breakdowns) and you can choose any one of the available spaces on the beginning card to place it in.&#10;&#10;A player who sinks a ship receives an order card.&#10;&#10;3.0. Contents:&#10;&#10;15 map cards&#10;30 order cards&#10;3 blue control cards&#10;3 red control cards&#10;1 scorecard&#10;18 red cubes&#10;18 yellow cube&#10;36 white cubes&#10;6 ship pieces&#10;2 score tokens&#10;&#10;3.1. Map cards:&#10;&#10;The map cards are divided into 4 boxes, which each count as one space for movement. Only 1 ship can occupy a box.&#10;&#10;Islands: These are impassable, so ships can not move over them, and they block line-of-sight for firing.&#10;&#10;Running water: When a ship enters this box, it automatically receives +1 movement which must be used to move to a neighbouring box. If that neighbouring box also has running water, the ship gains another +1 movement, and so on.&#10;&#10;3.2. Control cards&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of ship in Red Code: Submarine; Destroyer; Aircraft carrier. These have some similar manoeuvres, but also some manoeuvres which are unique to that kind.&#10;&#10;On the control card, yellow cubes (repairs) and red cubes (breakdowns) are used to show the state of the ship. Once both of these characteristics have been reduced to 0, the ship is sunk. During the game, any damage taken by the ship reduces the amount of repairs. When the number of repairs hits 0, remove a breakdown token and put 3 repair tokens back on the control card (1 breakdown = 3 repairs). You are not allowed to exceed the amount of breakdown and repair spaces available on the control card.&#10;&#10;Another area of the control card shows what your crew (white cubes) are doing, and this is used to manage the different manoeuvres. At the start, all ships have 6 crew, placed on the crew area on the control card. The control cards each have 4 common manoeuvre boxes and 4 unique manoeuvre boxes.&#10;&#10;Crew: These are used to pay the cost of your ship&rsquo;s manoeuvres. You use up your crew during the battle, but also recover crew each turn during the battle. [Representing the energy of your crew, rather than individual crew members] The crew are the engine of this game, and so good management of your crew is what makes your ship more lethal.&#10;&#10;Manoeuvres: You must choose appropriate attack or defence actions at particular points to manage your ship effectively. Manoeuvres with a crew member already on the square can not be used during that turn.&#10;&#10;&bull;    Movement: Move one square. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Repair: Regain 1 repair cube.&#10;    &bull;    Torpedo: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Orders: Draw one order card. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Immersion: Move two squares. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Countermeasure: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum of 2 spaces, and you regain 1 repair cube.&#10;    &bull;    Heavy torpedo: Does 2 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Floating mine: Does 2 repair damage plus 1 crew damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.&#10;    &bull;    Missile: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Depth charge: Does 2 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.&#10;    &bull;    Shield: Cancels the current manoeuvre, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Assault: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.&#10;    &bull;    Air support: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Radio support: Regain 1 repair cube at a maximum distance of 2 spaces. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Medical equipment: Regain 1 breakdown cube, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Radar: Does 1 repair damage plus 1 crew damage at a maximum distances of 3 spaces. Can not be responded to.&#10;&#10;Available manoeuvres: Manoeuvres that do not have any crew on their squares are available to be used. The players can only use these manoeuvres on their turn and can only use the manoeuvres on their ship, except for the response manoeuvres. Manoeuvres that can be used as responses are marked in yellow on the control card and can be used both on your turn and the other players&rsquo; turns. Note that the manoeuvre selected must be available to use - it must not have any crew on it. And responses can only be made when the player whose turn it is has executed a manoeuvre that allows responses.&#10;&#10;For example: The counter measure manoeuvre has a distance of two, and can repair 1 damage and do 1 damage.&#10;&#10;Visual field: This shows what your ship can see and where it can carry out actions. It includes the boxes in a straight line horizontally, vertically and diagonally from your ship and depends on the distance that the specific manoeuvre you want to use has. For example: If an manoeuvre has no distance, you can only carry it out on yourself, but if a manoeuvre has a distance of 2, then it can be used on any ship that distance or less (horizontally, vertically or diagonally only) including your own ship. [In the example picture, the red destroyer can target the blue submarine but can not target the blue destroyer.]&#10;&#10;Note that the enemy ships have the same effect as islands in blocking your line of sight.&#10;&#10;3.3. Order cards.&#10;&#10;These provide certain advantages in the game, providing bonuses, hurting the enemy or modifying the characteristics of the ship (movement, repairs, manoeuvres, etc.). Only 1 order card can be used per turn, but the effects can be used on any target on the table, regardless of distance or objects blocking line of sight. In other words, order cards are not affected by the visual field. In addition, order cards will always be executed and offer no chance for the enemy to respond. Each player may not have more than 3 order cards in their hand at any time.&#10;&#10;&bull;    Ambush: The target ship loses 2 repair.&#10;    &bull;    Deserter: The target ship loses 1 crew from the reserve. This crew member can be recovered in the crew recovery phase.&#10;    &bull;    Boatswain: The target ship recovers 2 crew.&#10;    &bull;    Atomic bomb: 2 repair damage to all ships in a 2 by 2 square (4 spaces in total).&#10;    &bull;    Evasion: The target ship gains +3 movement.&#10;    &bull;    Captain: 1 repair damage to the target ship, and then you draw 1 order card.&#10;    &bull;    Mechanic: The target ship gains 2 repair.&#10;    &bull;    Intercept: 1 repair damage to the target ship, and can not carry out any manoeuvres until their next turn. This means that the target ship will not be able to respond to any manoeuvres until its next turn.&#10;    &bull;    Kamikaze: 1 breakdown damage to the target ship (remember, 1 breakdown equals 3 repairs).&#10;&#10;4.0. Beginning of the game&#10;&#10;4.1. Preparation of the table:&#10;&#10;Shuffle the map cards and place face up a 3 by 4 formation (see example picture). The 3 cards left over are not used in the game.&#10;&#10;4.2. Preparation of the ships:&#10;&#10;The players are divided 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3, depending on the number of players. Next, each player selects a ship from the 3 available, and also takes the corresponding control card. Each player fills up that control card with the red and yellow cubes (repairs and breakdowns) indicated on the control card, plus 6 crew members.&#10;&#10;The two teams have a starting card in opposite corners of the board, and the team members put their ships into one of the 4 squares in their starting card.&#10;&#10;4.3. Start the game.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the order cards and deal out one initial order card to each player. Place the remaining deck of order cards in a pile face-down next to the board.&#10;&#10;5.0. Turn phases&#10;&#10;5.1. Recover crew&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you always replace 2 crew into your reserve, either from the manoeuvre spaces or from the pile of withdrawn crew (see the radar and floating mine manoeuvres and the deserter order card).&#10;&#10;You choose where to recover the crew from depending on what manoeuvres are needed for your next turn.&#10;&#10;5.2. Management of manoeuvres&#10;&#10;You use the manoeuvres available to your ship to try to sink the enemy. The manoeuvres cost crew to carry out the action (according to the number of boxes for that manoeuvre), but also depend on the line of vision of the ship. The target must be within the action&rsquo;s range and on a straight line either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.&#10;&#10;5.3. Possible responses:&#10;&#10;Responses are manoeuvres but can be used in your turn or the turn of another player. For example: Immersion can not be used as a response, but torpedo can be used as a response. The last manoeuvre declared is the first to be carried out. For example, if a player launches an action in front of an enemy and they launch a response which the initial player then responds too, then the response of the first player is completed, then the response of the opponent, and finally the initial manoeuvre. If in the middle of this chain of events a ship is sunk, further manoeuvres in the chain targeting that ship will be wasted but the manoeuvres will still be treated as spent, which means that the crew spent on the manoeuvres will remain spent and the manoeuvres will be unavailable.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Mythotopia",
        "description": "Mythotopia is a deck-building game set in a medieval fantasy world that draws on the mechanisms found in A Few Acres of Snow with players customizing their personal card decks by drafting cards and expanding into provinces.&#10;&#10;The game board is composed of forty provinces, each with its own card. At the start of play, you receive a number of Province cards at random, then mark your initial positions with town pieces. Shuffle these Province cards with a set of five Initial cards to form your starting deck, then draw a hand of five cards. The game includes 27 Improvement cards, 16 of which are drawn and placed on display; these cards will be drafted during the game.&#10;&#10;Mythotopia has nine variable victory point (VP) cards, four of which are drawn at random for a game; place these cards on display with three fixed VP cards, then place a number of VP counters on each card. The fixed VP cards give points for building cities, roads and castles, while the variable ones may change the board situation by adding dragons, runestones and citadels. Alternatively they may grant VPs for controlling a certain number of sea areas, for successfully attacking other players, and for building cities/roads. As these VP cards vary from game to game, they alter the balance between developmental and aggressive play.&#10;&#10;On your turn, perform two actions, then refill your hand to five cards. Nine actions are possible, such as buying armies or ships (after starting with six armies and two ships), placing these armies or ships, drafting Improvement cards (for a cost of one gold), placing cards in reserve (to use them on a future turn), permanently removing cards from your deck, using a card for its specific action, and invading a neighboring province. To invade, you must play the Province card from which you attack as well as military cards and food; invading must be the first of your two actions, so if you're placing armies to prepare for an attack, opponents have the chance to prepare defenses.&#10;&#10;Three resources are used in Mythotopia: food to feed invading armies, stone to build cities, roads and castles, and gold to buy armies, ships and Improvement cards. Most provinces contain one resource type, and gaining that province gives you that resource. You can turn towns into cities, which increases the number of cards you can keep in your reserve. You can connect provinces with roads, which allows you to substitute one card for another on the same network in addition to moving armies freely between those provinces. Castles increase the defensive value of a province.&#10;&#10;All of these constructions (cities, roads, castles) give you victory points, as does taking control of a province. Additional points are available via the VP cards, with you taking VP counters when you meet the condition on a card. For example, building a road gives you two VPs, but if the &quot;Roadside Inns&quot; VP card is in play, then you can expend an extra gold to gain an additional VP. You can lose VPs if you lose control of a province, but you never lose VP counters. The game ends after four of the seven VP cards have been emptied, and the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

These factions must work together to overcome the Emperor, but only one will eventually rule the future country. Otherwise, Flaut III suppresses the revolution and retains control...&#10;&#10;In Dark Empire: Revolution, each faction consists of a total of 13 cards: three cards with a value of 4-6 and two cards with values 7-8. There are ten additional cards which can be added to the strength of any faction card already in play. The table represents Vindoban, the capital of R`yan, where the emperor deploys his army on one side and the insurgent people gather on the other.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of turns (&quot;weeks&quot;). After four weeks, a month is completed with an intermediate scoring, and after three months a final scoring ends the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of seven cards, one random &ldquo;secret goal&rdquo; faction that the player attempts to guide to victory, and a set of &quot;temporary support&quot; cards. With these cards you secretly &ldquo;bid&rdquo; on the faction you believe will win the next month&rsquo;s scoring by having accumulated the most points.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: players simultaneously place one card each in the centre of the table, either towards the revolutionary forces, or as a traitor on the emperor's side adding this value to an &ldquo;Emperor card&rdquo; already placed in that location. This happens three times, but you are only allowed to place one of your three cards as a traitor. The week is then resolved and the player who provided the most support for the strongest faction puts aside one of his cards for this faction to be scored; in addition, this player is immediately awarded 2 extra points. The player who played the highest single card for this faction (not necessarily the same player!) is awarded 1 point. But beware - when the emperor (his card plus all traitors) gained more points than each single faction, the Emperor card is placed to the scoring! The table is cleared and the next week begins. After four weeks, a month is over and an intermediate scoring takes place. If you are correct with your prediction of this month&rsquo;s winner you gain another 6 points.&#10;&#10;After three months the final scoring occurs, determining the winner: the &ldquo;secret goals&rdquo; are revealed and the collected points of each player are added to the cards scored for their faction during the course of the game. The faction with the highest score wins the revolution - and the game. But: if the emperor can put down the rebellion - then the faction with the lowest score wins the game. Or, if the winning faction is too far ahead, it is immediately overthrown by all the others and the faction with the second highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is set in the world of the award winning German steampunk graphic novel Steam Noir (&ldquo;Best German Comic Book 2012&rdquo;).

Those recruit cards are included for free in every copy of our Treasure Chest and will be available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.&#10;&#10;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.&#10;&#10;The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.&#10;&#10;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.&#10;&#10;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.&#10;&#10;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&#10;&#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&#10;&#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

You must not only destroy the targets but you must also balance the delicate political repercussions of your attacks. If you strike too hard, your air offensive might be put on hold, strike to light, and you&rsquo;ll be blamed for losing the war.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Vietnam Air War!&#10;&#10;Each of the campaigns can be played with either an Air Force or Navy squadron. The targets assigned to each service are different and change the complexion of the campaigns. Each campaign can be played with three different durations of: Skirmish, Conflict, or War.&#10;&#10;Each mission takes roughly 30 minutes to set-up, plan, and resolve.&#10;&#10;Each of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions.&#10;&#10;For those of you familiar with our modern era Hornet Leader series of games, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s different about Phantom Leader&hellip;&#10;&#10;The freedom of being able to select the best mission based on military objectives is something that is commonplace for today&rsquo;s military. Back in Vietnam, the military was responsible for carrying out their orders, while at the same time being extremely limited in the weapons and tactics they were allowed to use to complete those orders. In many cases, the specific weapons, approach paths, and bombing altitudes were generated target-by-target at the White House. The mission specifics were then sent down the chain of command to the individual pilots flying the mission. As you can imagine, this was not the best way to run an air campaign.&#10;&#10;Every target has a Political value. If you destroy it, you move the Political counter to the right a number of spaces equal to its value. As the counter gets moved to the right, your future target choices are reduced to those that are less politically sensitive. Which target you choose not to attack is also important. You get to move the Political counter to the left a number of spaces equal its Political value.&#10;&#10;This means that while you might like to flatten a big enemy target and rack up the victory points, it might be better for you to choose a pointless target and move the Political counter in your favor instead.&#10;&#10;Another difference is in combat power. For the last couple decades, the US Air Force and Navy have enjoyed air superiority due to training and technology. Such was not the case in the skies over Vietnam. The enemy had different, but just as capable, equipment. They also had the training and will to use it to its utmost.&#10;&#10;They soon became aware of the limitations placed on the US forces by the politicians, and used those limitations to their advantage.&#10;&#10;For example, at times, US pilots were not permitted to fire on enemy aircraft until they were visually identified. This negated any range advantage conveyed by the radar-homing AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. It was also a common limitation that enemy aircraft could only be attacked in the air. US pilots were not allowed to attack enemy airbases. US aircraft were also limited to flying predictable flight paths, at set times. This made setting up ambushes much easier for the enemy.&#10;&#10;So, while you might be a Hornet Leader ace, Vietnam is a whole different ballgame!&#10;&#10;",

The game went on to win the Best Strategic Card Game Award at the UK Games Expo 2013, along with Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles players use hands of 6 units, drawn from their total 'army' of 36 cards, playing one card per turn at the start of their turn.&#10;&#10;Cards have unique formations of Attack Arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played, and the damage they will do. Some cards also have Ranged Attack values. Each card then has a Defence value which, when exceeded by attacking cards, sees that card defeated.&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from their army deck to return their hand back up to 6 or retreat a unit that has not engaged in combat during that turn.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies - the Orcs and the Dwarves.&#10;&#10;These factions are differentiated by their exclusive cards and strategies; the Dwarf faction plays more defensively, using some Ranged cards and powerful Berserker units to pick-off assailants, while the Orc army encourages players to attack more vigorously, often committing kamikaze moves to their tactical advantage.&#10;&#10;Orcs versus Dwarves is cross-compatible with Elves versus Lizardmen, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another.

Players create a fleet of ships to purchase and move various commodities around the Mediterranean while also keeping well manned ships to attack and defend against other player's fleets.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(block of information submitted by user in comments not included in game entry)&#10;Board&#10;The maritime areas are bigger and there are fewer of them. Starting ports are different too: Alexandria is one of them in the new version.Resources and Trade&#10;One of the resources has changed (marble replaces gems) and the ports produce different resources compared to the 1996 version. In the 1996 version, when buying goods from a port owned by another player, you had to bargain. It could be hard. Now, you just pay them 1 ducat, instead of paying the bank.&#10;Wine is now special: one port with wine in its warehouse is worth more VP at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Game Flow (big point)&#10;In the 1996 version, all the players used to bid for turn order. Then, they all played the phases according to this order: they loaded, built and bought, then they all moved their galleys, they fought and finally they took over free ports and made money.&#10;There's no bidding anymore. Now, the galleys you build are numbered, and when it's the turn of one specific galley, its owner can perform their actions (load, move and fight, or build), before the next galley is the active one. If your galleys have successive numbers, you can play several times.&#10;The little flags that used to be awkwardly fixed on the galleys are now useless, and the men have to be in the player's colour (instead of being a nice bunch of nice Sailor Smurfs).&#10;This is a major difference, the game is radically altered.&#10;&#10;Counts and Victory Points&#10;There are several counts in the game, and not only one at the end of the game. What's more: another kind of count can bring players money if they have wine in their warehouse. All of that depends on the drawn cards at the end of a galleys' turn. The pace of the game may be altered by those cards, too.&#10;There is no card in the 1996 version.&#10;In this old version, the only way to have your port well valued at the end of the game was to have its warehouses full. It's now different too: a port with one good is better than one with none, but worse than one with two, etc.&#10;&#10;Other Changes&#10;There's a building more: basilic. It brings more VP.&#10;Galleys are easier to build but the price is not the same.&#10;Combat rules are very different, the fort has a different power. Dice are different too.&#10;Port limits to recruit sailors are different.&#10;2 and 3 players rules are different.&#10;...and this list is all but exhaustive.&#10;&#10;",

Smoke moves through a hole in the roof. The sun will set soon.&#10;&#10;The Shaman and each apprentice drink from the bowl simmering near the fire. The taste, bitter and revolting. The Shaman's assistant does not drink; he stands calmly beside her. The assistant is invisible. Adorned in animal skins and strange ornaments, the Shaman begins to guide the ritual. A drum is tapped with elderly fingers, creating a primitive disjointed rhythm. The weathered drum is played for some time, then stops abruptly. The Shaman looks about the room. She looks up to the ceiling, observing the smoke escaping into the sky.&#10;&#10;&quot;The plants now speak to us.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the adventure board game The Mushroom Eaters, 2-5 players are apprentices who have consumed a drink of the psilocybin mushroom.

In the east, the Army of Northern Virginia was holding off the Army of the Potomac, but Lee realized that this could not last forever. Something had to change, he would strike north and take the war to the enemy. After weeks of maneuver, a chance collision between the two armies would seal the fate of the Confederacy. Now is your chance to change history. Can you do better than Lee and crush the Union army as it arrives piecemeal? Or as Meade will you hold the heights and dash the last great hope of Confederate victory? The decisions are yours&hellip; in Gettysburg 150!&#10;&#10;Gettysburg 150 is an expansion of the ideas contained in Hold the Line. Like Hold the Line, it uses command action points for units to move and attack. The CRT is simliar, although artillery is weaker at longer ranges due to the greater scale of the battle. However, the board is not modular and infantry units are stronger. Units are division level, with brigade level cavalry. Advanced features like column movement is covered simply with movement bonuses for not moving adjacent to enemy units. More importantly, the game has optional rules to increase realism, including early reinforcements, army demoralization due to heavy losses, and rules to encourage corps organization. The game has 4 scenarios covering days 1, 2, and 3, as well as the Confederate attack on Little Round Top on July 2. Scenarios are playable in 1 hour for the day battles, 20 to 30 minutes for the Little Round Top scenario. The complete 3 day battle is playable in 2.5 to 3 hours.&#10;&#10;A division level Gettysburg game in honor of the 150th anniversary of the battle.  This simple fast playing game comes with a mounted 25 x 22 map, two counter sheets, rules, and dice.  You can play the entire battle in 2 to 3 hours, with 4 shorter scenarios.&#10;&#10;Players will maneuver the counters representing the Union and Confederate armies across a hex cover representation of the battlefield at Gettysburg.  Each turn players get a number of action points that will allow them to maneuver, fire combat, and close combat enemy forces.  You will always receive some action points, but will never be sure exactly how many recreating the uncertainty of command and control. Victory is obtained by driving the enemy from the field by capturing terrain objectives or eliminating enemy units.&#10;&#10;The game uses the popular Hold the Line game system as its base.  Optional rules include a Chaos of War table, force march, and more.&#10;&#10;Includes a mounted game board, 2 counter sheets with large 7/8&quot; counter sheets, dice, and rules.&#10;&#10;",

Players are wizards who use their energy to power spells and collect ingredients from the game board. Collect the right combination of ingredients &ndash; which varies depending on the number of players &ndash; and you win!&#10;&#10;Spell cards are the heart and soul of the game. You get two random spells at the start of each game, then can acquire more via short, &quot;once around&quot; auctions at the start of each round. You bid energy cubes in these auctions, and you have only ten, so bid wisely. When you win an auction, you place energy cubes equal to your bid on the spell card. A certain number of these cubes are removed from the card at the end of each round; once the final cube is removed, the spell leaves the game and you lose that power.&#10;&#10;Spell cards generate the Element cards depicted on them for their owners. You then use these Element cards to bid on and collect Ingredients. You can bid for Ingredients only with the Elements shown on the landmark tokens on areas of the game board; these tokens are placed randomly each game. To increase the strategy and player interactivity, some Spell cards let you bid extra cards or different cards, while others allow you to change the rules for bidding. After visiting 3-6 areas, with the number being determined by a die roll at the start of the round, the round ends and players remove Energy cubes from their spells.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player collects the required number of ingredients, e.g., in a six-player game, five differently colored ingredients or six ingredients in any combination of colors.&#10;&#10;",

To do so, however, you need to collect the ingredients for your three spell cards, and to do that you need to search the forest while Baba Yaga searches for you.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, place nine Baba Yaga tiles in a cross to form a flight path, then place the 16 ingredient tokens face down, with four tokens in each section of the cross. Each player starts the game with three spell cards, which must remain hidden. On a turn, the active player reveals her top spell card, which shows four ingredients, then starts searching for these ingredients in the forest, turning over tiles one by one with a single hand and hiding those she doesn't need. While she does this, the other players take turns moving the Baba Yaga figurine one step at a time along one branch of the flight path, then back. If Baba Yaga completes a circuit before the player finds the ingredients, she must place her spell card on the bottom of her stack; if she finds the ingredients, however, she gets to cast the spell on the card, lengthening or shortening the flight path, swapping the location of ingredients, requiring fewer ingredients next time, forcing an opponent to play in a distorted position, and so on. The first player to complete her three spells wins!&#10;&#10;Baba Yaga includes variants for younger players, more experienced players, and those who want the chicken-legged house to be constantly on the move. In the two-player game, the single opponent does all the moving of Baba Yaga, but must swap hands with each move, keeping the inactive hand on her head.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Over sixty years later, and the divisions still run deeper than the straits which separate the Republic of China from the People's Republic of China. Once again, a historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous people separated by politics and economics hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their bitter division once and for all.&#10;&#10;Next War: Taiwan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and the follow-on to Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war in and around the island of Taiwan. In this sequel, the communist state of China, the PRC, has decided that its time to end the rhetoric and posturing and bring the breakaway republic back into the Socialist Harmonious Society.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of the &quot;terrain&quot; surrounding Taiwan, the game features an expanded, yet still abstracted and playable, naval system including submarine threats, ASW, mine warfare, and anti-naval strikes. In addition, rules exist for combining Next War: Taiwan with Next War: Korea to simulate an expanded conflict.&#10;&#10;Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ownership of Next War: Korea will NOT be required to play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Units&#10;&#10;Ground units in Next War: Taiwan represent primarily brigades, regiments, and battalions of the armies of the two Chinas and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.&#10;&#10;Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.&#10;&#10;Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side. Changes to the naval system include&#10;&#10;     Naval Display Play Aid to allow for movement, air ranges, etc. in the seas surrounding Taiwan&#10;     a Submarine Threat Level and ASW Level matrix for the PRC and Allies respectively to represent the subsurface conflict&#10;     naval mine warfare allowing either side to attempt to deny usage of Beaches for Amphibious Assaults or Ports and Beachheads for Sea Transport&#10;     anti-Naval Strikes (including Cruise Missiles) allowing each side to force enemy Naval units to withdraw or risk losses&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Maps and Terrain&#10;&#10;The game's map presents the island of modern-day Taiwan at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map covers the entire island and includes several holding boxes and tracking displays.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game System&#10;&#10;A game turn is generally composed of:&#10;&#10;Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.&#10;&#10;Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.&#10;&#10;Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines.&#10;&#10;Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes.&#10;&#10;One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns&#10;&#10;Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements&#10;Victory Determination&#10;&#10;Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Scenarios&#10;&#10;There are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three are small and cover the first weeks of the war by dividing the island into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults by the PRC to establish beachheads and take Ports and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire Campaign Game which uses the entire map and all of the Standard Game rules. One other scenario is provided which examines a theoretical U.S. Amphibious landing in an attempt to take back the island.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.&#10;&#10;There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Chinese players in the region.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is a full set of rules covering how to play a combined Next War: Taiwan/Korea game.&#10;&#10;In Next War: Taiwan, the Taiwan Straits are on fire with the Goliath of the PRC arrayed against the David of the ROC. Can you, as the People's Liberation Army/Naval commander, conquer the separatist rebels in four weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear?

        "description": "In October 1813 Napoleon was finally forced to concentrate his multinational forces around the city of Leipzig within the Kindom of Saxony. With the three armies of the Anti-French Coalition approaching from all sides the stage was set for the largest European battle until World War I, the famous Battle of the Nations.&#10;&#10;Napoleon at Leipzig is a comprehensive game with a proven track record of excellent re-playability, among the most popular Napoleonic wargames of all time with 20,000 copies in print across the first 4 editions. Now it has a bigger playing area and more manpower for both sides, all working within a smooth and efficient engine of 19th-century warfare.&#10;With this edition all the units, set ups, maps, additional playing area, XIV Corps as Alternate Reinf. have been revised and brought up to the standard rules of The Library of Napoleonic Battles (vedettes, baggage trains, pontoons, cards...). &#10;Innumerable details have been added, such as the sandpit outside Leipzig and over 33% more terrain on the two mapsheets. The basic unit is still the brigade but unit strengths have been revised. Each unit now has an Initiative rating based upon the troop quality. There are now vedettes, though only for light cavalry in the first wave of units. After the board is full and the positions of the armies are known, the scouting r&ocirc;le of cavalry is over. The ever-critical baggage and pontoon trains are newly included. Perhaps the biggest game-changer is the possibility of hidden forces. But the impact, again, is limited, once the armies close for battle, by the fact that units within visual sight distance are revealed. We have bridge destruction and repair. Command works differently ... in the older version, Command was only required for Engaging with the enemy (i.e., entering EZOCs). Now units must either be In Command or make their Initiative roll to move at all.&#10;&#10;The main huge battle between Napoleon&rsquo;s Grande Arm&eacute;e and the coalition of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden is simulated as well as the two starting engagements at Liebertwolkwitz and Wachau-M&ouml;ckern.&#10;&#10;Also included is Napoleon's last battle on German soil, when his last German ally, the Kingdom of Bavaria, changed sides and tried to block the retreating French army at Hanau. Bavarian General Wrede wasn't aware to meet Napoleon himself and the still powerful remnants of the French Army. So he offered battle, hoping to crush stranglers and routing French forces. Napoleon was said to be pleased to lecture his former Ally how to fight a real battle. It started at October 29th at about 08:00h and ended during the early morning hours of October 31st, when the mass of retreating French pushed their way free towards Frankfurt and Mainz.&#10;&#10;BATTLES SIMULATED:&#10;&#10;     Liebertwolkwitz, Epic Cavalry Battle, 13-14 Oct. &#10;     Wachau-M&ouml;ckern, Fire on Two Fronts, 16 Oct.&#10;     Leipzig, Triple Envelopment, 17-18 Oct.&#10;     Hanau, Grande Arm&eacute;e in Retreat, 29-30 Oct.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM:&#10;The Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series&quot;&#10;- scale = 480m/hex,&#10;- time = 1hour/GT,&#10;- strength = 500-800 men/SP.&#10;&#10;",
