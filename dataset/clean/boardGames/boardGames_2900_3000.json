        "description": "DOWNTOWN is a game of air warfare over Hanoi. During the Rolling Thunder (1965-68) and Linebacker (1972) campaigns, Hanoi and the Red River Valley was the focus of American air operations intended to pressure North Vietnam's Communist leadership  into ceasing their attacks on the South. Against large &quot;packages&quot; of US attack and support aircraft, the Vietnamese deployed a formidable array of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs). They also had a force of MiG fighter jets.&#10;&#10;Covering air operations from 1965 to 1972, Downtown simulates the clashes between American air power and the North Vietnamese air defence system. The United States player controls Air Force and Navy strikes into Route Packs 5 and 6 - the heart of the Vietnamese defences.&#10;&#10;Packages include forces of bombers, fighters, recon planes, jamming aircraft and &quot;Iron Hand&quot; aircraft for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The US player's objective is to destroy ground targets. They can only succeed by integrating all the package elements to complete the mission with minimal loss.&#10;&#10;The North Vietnamese player controls concentrations of AAA, Fire Can radar-directed artillery and SAM . They can launch MiG fighters to intercept the bomber streams aimed at 'Downtown' Hanoi. The Vietnamese player must disrupt enemy attacks.&#10;&#10;The scale is 2.5 nautical miles per hex and 1 minute per game turn. Individual units are flight-sized air units (1-4 aircraft), battalion-sized SAMs (six SA-2 launchers), or multi-battery concentrations of AAA. Scenarios cover historical strike raids from the Rolling Thunder and Linebacker operations. Campaigns simulate raids taking place over the course of several days.&#10;&#10;",

In each round, players from each team sit side-by-side and look at the same word card. Word cards differ in 3 ways. (1) With one neutral colored word listed, each member models to communicate the same word. (2) With 3 neutral colored words, each modeler has free choice but may end up molding the same word. (3) With 3 words listed in 3 different colors, modelers can only mold according to the color of their dough. To start, each modeler places their ball of dough onto their plastic mat, which outlines start positions for their hands. Each modeler simultaneously tries to represent their word. The first team to shout out the correct word winsxed amount of dough from their opponent's model using a plastic extracting tool. The winning team can also reclaim a previously extracted amount. A team can lose for calling out a color coded word that another team member is modeling.  Once a team loses all of their dough, the game ends, and the team with the most dough wins.&#10;&#10;",

If you expand too fast without buying beehives, hire fishermen and  foresters you won&acute;t be able to maintain your landed properties. This is the time to build castles and mills as well. At the beginning of the next year a random event happens (such as plague, floods or robber barons coming to the valley).&#10;The optional rules add religion (you have to choose a religion and build churches or celtic stone circles) and honour, weather (which influences the harvest) and loyalty of your troops. &#10;Winner is the player who owns first 21 of the 40 fiefs or has the highest amount of honour after ten years of play (optional).&#10;&#10;",

For example, there are no rules for Immelman turns or barrel-rolls, but the Immelman is accomplished just as in real life... a half-roll followed by continuous banking from the inverted position back to the upright position; a barrel roll is accomplished by a combination of banking and altitude changes during otherwise forward-flight.&#10;&#10;There is an interesting rule for ace pilots where the ace pilot can withhold (i.e. not write a movement plot for) a certain number of movement points. After the non-aces have completed their entire movement plot then the ace's can plot out the rest of their move and therefore react to the less-skilled pilots actions. The number of points the ace can withhold is based on the 'grade' of the pilot with a 'grade 5' pilot unable to withhold any points to a 'grade 1' pilot being able to withhold 3.&#10;&#10;Game related to Aces High: The American Aces&#10;&#10;",

Each die has 8 sides with variable levels of attack and defense, as well as special powers. Facing matters when attacking, but range only matters if one potential target is closer than another.&#10;When a die attacks: if its Attack value is greater than the target's Defense value, the target die is destroyed and the player scores its point value. If the Attack Value is lower (even an Attack of 1 agains the Ogre's 40+), the target shifts one side (effectively losing 1 of its 1d8 hit points).&#10;Instead of attacking, a die can move, rotating on its edge for a better firing position or to expose a better face. The Ogre can both fire and then move, making it hard to kill.&#10;If the Defender can get several dice on the table, they have a Command Post which can activate every die, bringing the Ogre down quickly. The Ogre also has a 'systems card' like the old Steve Jackson game, allowing its weapons and treads to be attacked.&#10;The winner is the first to score 50 points; the Ogre is worth 50 points and the Command Post isn't worth any (destroying it is not the goal).&#10;&#10;List of Diceland sets and armies&#10;&#10;Related to the Ogre/GEV Family.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The basic game (Attack!) is a very simple game of expansion and conflict set in the World War 2 era. It is aimed at those game players who enjoy rules that are very simple and easy to get into. The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player starts with a few regions (one of which is his capital), and a few military units. Players expand their power bases by adding regions to their &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. This may be done either through diplomacy (they join willingly), or military conquest (they join, period).&#10;&#10;There are three major sub-games in Attack!:&#10;1) Land Combat: A simple system where each unit has certain advantages based on its historical role.&#10;&#10;2) Sea Combat: A simple system where each ship type (Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer, and Sub) has certain advantages based on its historical role.&#10;&#10;3) Economic: A simple system determines production. The player starts with one card per region owned, and then gets a new one for each new region added. The cards come in four basic flavors (suites): Resources, Factories, Transport Network, and Oil. Each card has a value printed on it that represents the base economic value of that region. If the player is able to create an entire &quot;set&quot; (one of each suite), he doubles the printed value on those cards. There is also a fifth type of card which has a minimum value of &quot;1&quot; that represents a region without any special economic value (just &quot;population&quot;).&#10;&#10;The units include: Infantry, Tank, Artillery, and Air. These are high quality plastic minis, which come in two sizes: regular for only one unit and slightly larger for groups of five.&#10;The map shows the world circa 1935 centered around the Atlantic (North and South America, Europe, and Africa). The expansion contains the map of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Attack! Expansion&#10;    Attack! Deluxe Expansion (Replaces Attack!

Players try to contribute the most to the land of Zarahemla by building settlements, cities, roads, and helping construct the temple. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards) - wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone - to build up their civilizations to get to 12 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Game play is similar to Settlers of Catan, but players can add a stone to the temple by paying one brick and one stone.  The player who contributes the most stones gains 2 extra victory points.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone collecting any resource cards based on the roll and position of settlements (or upgraded cities) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), from having made the biggest contribution to building the Zarahemla temple, and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 12 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Rather than having individual hexes like Catan the game has five separate strips of hexes.

Then, you put your R2 unit in the droid control center and the rebel in the hanger bay.  Then place the stormtrooper in the Stormtrooper control center.  You then take 6 explosives and place them near you.  You also shuffle and deal out the Rebel Mission Card.  This tells you the rooms you need to plant explosives in and the key cards you need to obtain to enter the inner level.  You then start the VHS tape.  Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) will come on and goad you.  You then begin play.  As stated above, play is in real-time, so you have to play quickly.  The objective is to plant your explosives and disable the Death Star II (turn off the VHS tape) before it reaches D'rinba IV.

        "description": "First edition:&#10;&#10;Rather silly party game, distributed by a certain coffee retail powerhouse that will remain nameless.&#10;&#10;As one moves around the board, one can land on _Brainstorm_ (vaguely reminiscent of free-association Scattergories), _Survey Says!_ (a touch like the Family Feud TV game show), or present a short _Sound Bite_ to the other players, who will vote on presentation and persuasiveness.&#10;&#10;To make sure no-one takes the proceedings too seriously, there's a _Skid Row_ space (lose all points, and beg the other players to donate.  Why would they want to, you ask?) and a _Party Change_ spot - where you change identities (color, score, seat, beverage?!?) with another player.&#10;&#10;Like all such games, it works well with the right crowd.&#10;&#10;Second edition:&#10;&#10;Hear Me Out, in its latest form, corrects some of the major problems the first edition had. Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player's answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as &quot;Nuclear BLANK&quot;). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.&#10;&#10;What makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.&#10;&#10;",

In short, the Germans expected Typhoon to end the war in the east. Spearheading the German attack was Army Group Center, General Guderian's PanzerArmee, with some 900,000 men in 70 divisions. Facing them, blocking the way to the Soviet seat of power, were over 800,000 Soviet troops in 95 divisions.&#10;&#10;The German assault was ferocious and incessant and came within sight of the Moscow Kremlin. Although their attacks ripped gaping holes in the Soviet lines, the defenders did not disintegrate, as the Germans expected.

While conventional operations are the result of the efforts of numerous commanders and staff officers, patrols generally depend entirely on the patrol leader's actions . . . I made every attempt to present the tactical situations as the patrol leader would experience them. I wanted the game system to avoid excessive administrative bookkeeping and rules memorization . . . I tried to simulate patrolling from my own experiences and not be tied to more standard wargame conventions . . . The element of chance throughout Ranger is by design. No patrol leader can control his environment. He can only plan for as many possibilities as he has time and be alert and prepared to implement these contingency plans if necessary. Even the most experienced player making all the correct decisions will occasionally be destroyed. Combat is always dangerous, but even more so when forward of friendly lines.&quot;&#10;&#10;Components: Rules of Play booklet, Patrolling Tactics booklet, Tactical Events booklet, laminated game map, laminated Patrol Record Log, plastic Tactical Template, Glossary folder, Combat Results Card, Tactical Reference Card, Extended Patrolling Card, 18 Mission Cards, 2 six-sided dice, China marker pencil.&#10;&#10;",

Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing.

        "description": "Introduction:&#10;&#10;Drang Nach Osten! is an historical game/simulation of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 that lead to the gates of Moscow and ultimately to the destruction of the Wehrmacht and the fall of the Third Reich. Drang Nach Osten! is a complete game of the largest invasion in history, but may be incorporated into the larger series of game/simulations collectively titled Europa. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942.  Unentschieden (Europa II) continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire war in the East, 1941-45.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Five 21 x 27&quot; mapsheets (numbered Europa 1 through 5).&#10;    One set of eight unit countersheets (for a total of 1792 counters) consisting of:&#10;    Two Europa sheet 1&#10;    One Europa sheet 2&#10;    Three Europa sheet 3&#10;    One Europa sheet 4&#10;    One Europa sheet 5 (half-sheet)&#10;    One rules folder and cover.&#10;    One set of charts and tables consisting of:&#10;        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle&#10;        One Soviet Order of Appearance&#10;        One Soviet Units Appearing Chart&#10;        One German Initial Order of Battle&#10;        One German Order of Appearance&#10;        One German Units Appearing Chart&#10;        Two Combat Results Tables&#10;        One Unit Identification Chart&#10;        One Time Record Chart&#10;        One Terrain Effects on Combat Chart&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Notes:&#10;&#10;Each hex is 16 miles, each turn is two weeks. Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. There is a fair amount of unit specialisation, although at 20 pages the rules are far less intimidating by today's standards than when they first appeared over thirty years ago. Drang Nach Osten! lasts for 19 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Mar II 42), so allowing for the initial set up 20 sessions of several hours is a realistic playing time.&#10;&#10;",

At the same time is 'Pieter van Eckhardt' trying to obtain possession of paintings from the museum.&#10;&#10;Both quests are taking place in the museum at night. The players sneak in, exposing the system of corridors by opening playing tiles. On five tiles are secret rooms, which contains paintings and/or paintings, which the team try to get out one by one. You get points for the discovery and objects belonging to your quest, but you can also remove tiles the opponents want.&#10;&#10;You opponent will do everything in their power to stop you by shooting at you, blocking corridors and stealing your points. Also beware of the guards, which might force you to restart from the entrance. The last piece is booby-trapped, so you need to run for you life to the entrance.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you do 3 actions that are either:&#10;- Take one action card (reloading) of either ammo (to shoot), life (to protect) or energy (to move, open tile or rotate tile) cards.&#10;- Playing 1 or more action cards of the same sort (ammo, life or energy).&#10;&#10;There is one tile of each card symbol, where you may reload 2 cards of the type. You can never have more than 7 cards.&#10;&#10;The players scores point by getting 1 point for each discovery tile and 2 or 3 point for either paintings or evidence, depending of which team they belong.&#10;&#10;With 4 players, you play in teams. With 2 or 3 players you play individually with Lara on the 'good side' and 1 or 2 'bad guys' as opponents. If equal, then the winner is the one who gets the last point.&#10;&#10;",
