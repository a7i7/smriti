This is the struggle of mankind against a universe full of alien invaders, usurpers and traitors who seek to shatter the fragile Imperium of Man. Epic Battles feature immense armies of infantry, dozens of tanks and giant war engines such as the Titans and super-heavy tanks.&#10;Engage in massive conflicts across entire worlds engulfed in war-worlds such as Armageddon.&#10;&#10; The Rulebook contains all the information you need to begin playing games of Epic. In addition it contains historical background, army lists, scenarios and gaming advice about the world of Armageddon and the forces involved in the fierce war there. These include the Imperial Guard armies of the Steel Legion Mechanized Infantry, Space Marines of the Adaptes Astartes, Titan Legions, Aircraft of the Imperial Navy and the forces of the Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka.&#10; This is the 4th incarnation of Games Workshop Epic battles but it is very different to the others and has brought back much detail that was lost in the 3rd edition Warhammer Epic 40,000. The rulebook is a great accomplishment with full color throughout, excellent stories and a fantastic set of rules that play smoothly and add lots of extra special rules.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Epic Swordwind&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Duel Masters, players build a deck of creatures and spells using cards from starter decks and booster packs. Your creatures are brought into play by paying the mana cost associated with it and are used to attack your opponents creatures or shields. Each player starts the game with 5 shields in play. These shields are merely 5 cards from your deck that are dealt face-down in front of you before the game starts. The shields, along with any &quot;tapped&quot; creatures you have in play, form your defenses. When a creature attacks a player and isn't blocked, that creature breaks one of that player's shields. Each time a player's shield is broken, the player puts the shield into his hand. You win the game if on of your creatures attacks your opponent when he has no shields left (as long as your creature isn't blocked).&#10;&#10;Duel Masters is played in a very similar fashion to Magic: The Gathering, which is also made by Wizards of the Coast. Much of the terminology used in Duel Masters is the same as in Magic as well, such as &quot;tapped&quot;, &quot;summoning sickness&quot;, etc.&#10;&#10;Re-released as: Kaijudo&#10;&#10;",

Each scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.&#10;&#10;&quot;By design, the game is not overly complex&quot;, says Memoir '44 designer, Richard Borg. &quot;The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.&quot; In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir '44 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice.&#10;&#10;Memoir '44 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. And with Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.&#10;&#10;The Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.&#10;&#10;",

As the tally of encirclements and surrenders mounts, the German advance appears unstoppable to Hitler and many others. However, the officers and men at the front are beginning to have serious misgivings -- not in themselves, but in the pre-war intelligence estimates that they had received. They had not been prepared to encounter hundreds of KV-1's and T-34's, tanks far superior to anything they possessed. For the moment, German tactics provided the margin of victory over better material, but the Russians were proving to be quick learners. Worse yet, by western European standards, Russian losses had been so staggering that there should have been no army left to fight. Not so. There seemed to be no end to these tenacious Russian defenders. As the German forces continued their eastward advance, more and more soldiers began asking, &quot;What have we gotten ourselves into?&quot;&#10;&#10;Kiev, the first major German objective in the south, did not fall on schedule. In fact, Soviet resistance was so fierce that it required diverting Guderian's Panzer Group away from the advance on Moscow. Kiev fell in one of the greatest encirclements of the Second World War, but the German advance on Moscow was delayed for several critical weeks. Quite possibly the delay at Kiev might have cost the German forces victory in the battle for Moscow.&#10;&#10;840 full-color two-sided counters.  &#10;MAPS   &#10;Three 22x34&quot; and one 17x22&quot; full-color mapsheets  &#10;OTHER  One 10-sided die &#10;36-page Rule Book &#10;36-page Play Book &#10;Player Aid Cards: four two-sided Soviet Set-Up cards, four two-sided Axis Set-Up cards, Soviet Status card, Axis Status card, two 11x17 two-sided game chart cards, two cards of additional scenario charts. &#10; Eight scenarios allow players to vary their level of involvement, complexity, and starting point, from introductory to full campaign &#10;An asymmetrical sequence of play that highlights Axis armored breakthroughs and Soviet difficulties in combined arms warfare &#10;Detailed air rules that integrate with land combat and weather rules &#10;Incredibly detailed orders of battle, including special coverage of artillery, rocket artillery, engineers, bridge units, armored trains, and much more &#10;Modifications to the proven Typhoon system include revised overrun and Soviet surrender procedures, as well as a new non-op Soviet HQ system to simulate the rigid yet fragile Soviet Command structure &#10;Extensive bibliography and design/historical notes&#10;&#10;Scenarios include;&#10;&#10;Scenario #1 &quot;Assault on Kiev&quot; which uses a portion of map G.

Once the crown jewel of Czarist Russia, Leningrad is now the second most important city in the Soviet Union. Its array of ordnance factories includes the massive Kirov Tank Works that turns out most of the heavy KV-1 and KV-2 production for the Soviet Army. Loss of Leningrad would deprive the Soviets of a major population and industrial center and give the Germans the advantage of position in any drive against Moscow from the northwest. &#10;Army Group North, short of Luftwaffe support and motorized forces, is the only army group that fails to achieve a significant encirclement at any stage of its campaign. Skillfully utilizing terrain and ruthlessly exploiting the civilian population, the Soviets construct a fortified line along the Luga River that stalls the Germans for a month until massive Luftwaffe and motorized reinforcements from Army Group Center allow a decisive breakthrough and dash for Leningrad itself. In a furious September battle, the Germans fall just short of taking Leningrad when time runs out. Operation Typhoon, the final push against Moscow, is imminent. Army Group North must give up almost all of its Luftwaffe and motorized formations. With no strike force remaining, the Germans dig in.

Whoever can't get rid of the Hex token by using his cards &quot;blows up,&quot; thus losing points. Naturally, there are nuances to this. There are 17 different cards in the deck, some which merely pass the Hex token left, right, and across, while others split the token in two, or increase it's damage. One dismisses it entirely. One blows it up while in another player's possession. One forces the token to pass in only one direction, some cause extra effects if the token DOES blow up on you. A round ends when there are no more Hex tokens available, and there are as many rounds as there are players, plus one.&#10;&#10;There are some interesting strategies that are not immediately apparent, but which become obvious after the first couple of rounds. Controlling when the last token blows up is very important since you lose and gain points based on this, so learning to play the cards to force the location of the tokens when they blow up is of paramount importance. Sending them to a player who has no cards to play works very well for this.&#10;&#10;Scores are kept with individual cards monitoring &quot;Voice&quot;, which is just points. How many you have at the end of the x+1 rounds determines who the winner is.&#10;&#10;One last amusing thing about the game is a bit of chaos tossed in; a Hex Hex card; when it's played, all players have to drop their card hands and put their hands in the air.

Each side also seeks the allegiance of minor Greek city-states and barbarian tribes: some that persevere and others that come and go. Revolts, sieges, leaders, wintering, and civic discord all play important roles.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to erode enemy prestige to the point of Surrender by capturing cities, winning battles, and devastating enemy territory with raids. Walled cities are very strong in defense, leaving Siege as a common method of reduction. But if a Siege is broken by a relieving force, the lost battle reduces the besieger's prestige!&#10;&#10;The map depicts Ancient Greece in the Aegean area, including the Peloponnese, continental Greece, Macedonia, Thrace and Ionia. A separate area on the map contains Sicily. Units include fleets, cavalry, archers, infantry and hoplites. Cards drive military actions and special events.

Events include leader change, plague, barbarian uprisings, revolts, civil unrest, etc.&#10;&#10;Hellenes includes 4 scenarios: The 431 BC Campaign (10 turns), The Sicily Campaign (5 turns), The 415 BC Campaign (12 turns), and The 413 BC Campaign (10 turns).

If business is really bad, you can still rely on bank or stagecoach hold-ups to reestablish you.

The topic is read aloud and the players must think up a word that fits the topic and uses any or all of the permissible consonants but not the forbidden consonant. The first to think up a word announces it and totals its value. The other players then secretly decide whether anyone else can come up with a higher scoring word. Once the players have voted anyone who thinks a higher scoring can been generated has an additional twenty seconds (a sand timer is included) to announce that word. Points are scored based on who came up with the round's winning word and who voted correctly.&#10;&#10;The final round of the game has the players deciding which of two teams to join secretly. The player who comes up with the highest scoring word on each team scores the most points.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

With the recent Imperial victory at Breslau (November 22) Austrian forces under Prince Charles of Lorraine and Field-marshal Daun, the victor at Kolin, were only a battle away from that goal. They expected to fight this battle in the new campaign year which would begin in the coming spring.&#10;&#10;For King Frederick II the loss of Silesia would not only be a devastating blow to his prestige but deprived of its resources, revenue and manpower Prussia's ability to continue the war would be desperately compromised. Rather than to allow the enemy to go unchallenged Frederick marched his remaining army of 40,000 men composed of Rossbach veterans and Breslau survivors against Charles' nearly 60,000 polygynous force of Austrians, Hungarians, Imperials, Bavarians and Wurttembergers.&#10;&#10;On a frigid December 5th, in a season when armies usually sought the comfort of winter quarters, the opposing forces met on the snow covered fields surrounding the Silesian village of Leuthen. After deftly maneuvering around Prince Charles' flank Frederick's Prussians attacked with unprecedented fury collapsing the enemy line. However, despite this initial crushing blow the Austrians were able to reorganize their front and fight the Prussians to a standstill leaving the battle's final outcome still in doubt. Only after a climactic cavalry charge did the Habsburg army finally break and retreat to Breslau. Two weeks later the city capitulated and the Austrians evacuated Silesia. Although the war would continue for another six years Frederick would never again attain the level of success he did at Leuthen, his greatest victory.&#10;&#10;Leuthen (Battles from the Age of Reason, Vol. 3) presents both gamers and students of the period with a colorful and meticulously detailed simulation with which to explore the actual events and possibilities of this definitive battle. Included is an historical commentary written especially for the game by the period's leading authority, Prof. Christopher Duffy. This narrative contains many previously unpublished aspects of the battle and includes maps, diagrams, statistics and his analysis of the 1757 campaign in Silesia.&#10;&#10;",

Force marching from Silesia through blazing summer heat, Frederick races to bring about a decisive battle. On 25 August near the village of Zorndorf 43,000 Russians and 36,000 Prussians fight one of the most savage battles of the war. For nearly 10 hours they hammer one another, yet by day's end neither army yields, despite staggering losses - nearly half the Russians and one-third of the Prussians were casualties. Finally, both armies limp away, each claiming victory: the Russians back into Poland; the Prussians to Saxony and a new Austrian threat.&#10;&#10;Zorndorf is the second game in the acclaimed Battles from the Age of Reason (BAR) series.
