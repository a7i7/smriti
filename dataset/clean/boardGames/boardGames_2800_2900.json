Each turn, they draw two cards &ndash; from the two draw piles or two discard piles, with each card coming from a different pile &ndash; then either discard one card or lay down a set of cards. To lay down a set, you need at least two cards if that type of chicken hasn't been played or more cards than are already on the table if it has been played. Any cards of the same type on the table are discarded onto a single discard pile. The round ends when one player has six types of chicken, all types of chicken are on the table, or only one draw pile remains. Players then earn points based on which types of chickens they own: for example, Marilyn Henroe has only six cards in the deck and is worth 6 points, while Billy the Chick has twenty cards and is worth 20 points.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In 2005, SimplyFun republished Crazy Chicken as Drive, with rules for up to four players and a collectible car theme.

        "description": "Avalon is a card-based game where a line of 11 landscape cards form the board and the cards in your hand are made up of Knights and Enchantresses. There are 8 of each in each of five different colors, for a total of 80 cards, which both players share as a common draw deck.&#10;&#10;The game starts with the landscapes face down, randomly assigned knights or enchantresses on each player's side of the landscape cards, and five knights/enchantresses in each players hand. In the course of the game, if you play knights on your side of the territory and you have at least as many cards on your side before playing the card, you have the option of declaring an attack with that knight. The other player has a chance to respond by defending with a knight of exactly the same color (in which case both knights are left in place). If the attacker is successful, the loser loses all of their cards from their side, and the winner loses an equal number. Then, the winner must lose an additional number of cards from their side or the hand equal to the total number of knights on both sides that were involved in the conflict. Finally, the region is turned face up with the crowns on the bottom facing toward the controlling player. You can only attack up to two landscapes per turn, but you may play as many cards as you would like to on your turn. The max hand size at the end of a round is 5. The object is to control 15 crowns at the end of your turn (number of crowns on a card ranges from 1-3).&#10;&#10;Two landscape cards have special abilities - Avalon reduces your loss from battles by one once per turn, and the forest with a standing stone allows you to declare an attack on your opponent with an enchantress as if she was a knight.&#10;&#10;Enchantresses normally will convert enemy knights from their side of the board to yours unless countered with a same color enchantress. The countering player receives the aggressor's attacking enchantress into his hand if he counters an enchantress.&#10;&#10;When the player is done playing cards, he draws one of the 5 Light tiles or 4 Dark tiles that describe the options for replenishing cards in hand. Light tiles give you their benefit immediately, and Dark tiles give you their benefit at the beginning of your next turn. Each tile is used only once until all tiles have been used, at which point they are all available again. After drawing a replenishment tile, the player's turn is over and the game continues with the next player.&#10;&#10;Avalon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns placing 3 of their player tokens on the tile of their choice.

Any other number will result in some players gaining resources. Rolling doubles gives your regular allotment of resources, plus a resource of your choice.  Rolling 2 or 12 allows you to place a marker on one tile that either doubles or eliminates production for that tile.&#10;&#10;Players can use their resources to bring out new player tokens, buy new tiles for inner circles of hell, move themselves, descend deeper into hell, move others, flip tiles, or alter die rolls.  Players can trade resources with other players during their turn.  The lower circles of hell generate more resources (2 for 3/4, 3 for 5/6 and 4 for 7/8).&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player descends to the ninth level and defeats Lucifer by rolling a 10 or better on two dice.&#10;&#10;",

Each game and module in the series will add maps, units, and all the personalities that will enable you to play, in some, but not daunting, detail your favorite periods.&#10;&#10;Volume I, Rise of the Roman Republic, is the introductory game to the Ancient World series with shorter, smaller scenarios. Rise of the Roman Republic includes scenarios for the Samnite Wars (which also includes a three-player version that takes in the invasion of Alexander of Epirus), the invasion of Pyrrhus (including his Sicilian adventures), and also the first three years of Hannibal, all on a single map of Italy, complete with dated road system.&#10;&#10;The focal point of the game system is the unusual set of mechanics that, in essence, have no allowance limits to movement. Units - troops under a leader - are free to move as far and as long as they want, subject to two major factors: leader capability to do so, as well as attrition.&#10;&#10;The Romans are really fun, mostly because you have to master the Roman political system, from yearly elections, to pro-roguing consuls, even to asking the Senate permission to do many things, all of which serve to make running the Roman armies about as close to realistic as has ever been seen in a wargame.&#10;&#10;The land combat system uses a unique Combat Results Table that includes the dreaded Unusual Result dicerolls, which replicate the battles that took place wherein the outcome belied the odds. But you still get the Carthaginian cavalry, the Epirote hoplites, elephants, and all the usual goodies you'd expect in such a game.&#10;The Ancient World is aimed at aficionados of the subject, as well as those interested in the breadth and depth of campaign operations.

Countless swarms of Red infantry, tanks, and guns then swept the lines. In four days, the pincers met near Kalach-um-Don &ndash; entombing the 6th Army in Stalingrad. During the next three months, the Germans will reel from successive Soviet hammer blows, try in vain to relieve the 6th Army, and fail to supply it from the air. The 6th Army surrenders, and only the counter-attack by von Manstein&rsquo;s panzers stop the red tide. The turning point of World War II in Europe has passed.&#10;&#10;Enemy at the Gates, the second Operational Combat Series release by The Gamers, offers players different challenges from those in the very popular game Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg. The Soviet army has rearmed and reorganized their Tank Corps &ndash; their challenge to the Panzer Divisions. The unique force structures of each side force players to fight differently in order to maximize their strengths. And, of course, players must face the toughest operation and strategic choices they have ever faced. When to stand, when to run&hellip;and when to strike.&#10;&#10;Enemy at the Gates covers the entire period from 19 November 1942 to mid-March 1943. There are numerous one and two map scenarios. The game covers Operation Uranus, Operation Little Saturn, the German Relief and airlift efforts, and Operation Star and Gallup (to include von Manstein&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;backhand blow&rdquo;).&#10;&#10;Extensively researched, playtested, and developed, Enemy at the Gates will satisfy the Eastern Front interest of any gamer who wants to know more than the pulp-history version of these pivotal events!&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;Dynamic and fluid situation&#10;All of the pivotal battles in AG South&#10;The creation of the Stalingrad pocket&#10;The relief effort and airlift&#10;Mansteins famous Backhand Blow!&#10;Follow-on to the popular Guderian's Blitzkrieg game and system- refined based on player feedback&#10;Player skill is highly rewarded&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: Half-week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Army&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Four 22 x 34&quot; maps (Maps A, B, C &amp; D)&#10;One 8 x 11&quot; Stalingrad 'Blow-Up' map&#10;Eight dual-side printed countersheets (5 combat, 3 markers - 2,800 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 36-page OCS rules booklet&#10;One 36-page Enemy at the Gate game specific rules booklet&#10;Two 6-page OCS version 2.0 Charts &amp; Tables Folders&#10;Four Player Aid cards&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Playing Time: 4-100 hours&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;&#10;",

It covers the entirety of World War II in Europe from September 1939 to the end of 1945.&#10;&#10;Europe Engulfed plays fast with its focus on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in a single 10-to-14 hour day once players become familiar with its elegant game systems including:&#10;&#10;Wood Block Units:&#10;Wood blocks for land units provide a realistic fog of war. Only the controlling player can see if their units are armor or infantry, weak or strong until combat is engaged. The inability to know the strength of your opponent ensures that even the most experienced players will make their fair share of tactical and strategic errors.&#10;&#10;Production and Strategic Warfare:&#10;Europe Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. The inventive production system shows that the conquering power does not get the same value out of resource areas as the original power that lost them. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include special actions, fleets, U-boats, strategic fighter and bomber assets, ground-support units, flak, V-weapons, and, of course, lots and lots of armor and infantry and the odd paratrooper or cavalry unit from which to choose.&#10;&#10;Special Actions:&#10;Special actions are an innovative rule system to account for the large historical territorial gains that occurred over the course of a two-month game turn without bogging the game down with multiple player turns. Using Special Actions, players can purchase additional movement phases and combat rounds, amphibious and airborne assaults, and even take actions during an opponent's combat phase.&#10;&#10;Rulebook and Playbook:&#10;The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play highlighting the May/June 1940 turn which reveals tactics for successfully attacking and defending.&#10;&#10;Europe Engulfed plays quickly with a very historical feel. Many players have indicated that they actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war. We know of no other European Theater of Operations game that plays this fast and with this much historical value.&#10;&#10;Play Times:&#10;1939 Campaign: Up to 14 hours&#10;1941 Campaign: Up to 10 hours&#10;Blockskrieg!: Up to 6 hours&#10;European War: Up to 5 hours&#10;'42 - '43 two-map scenario: 4 hours&#10;'42 - '43 one-map scenario: 3 hours&#10;Patton's Fantasy scenario: 2 hours&#10;&#10;Integrates with: &#10;&#10;    Asia Engulfed&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A game with very few rules, one that would be very simple to learn and play.&#10;&#10;3. A game that could be played with a high degree of skill.&#10;&#10;4. A game that would not be determinate. A determinate game such as nim or noughts and crosses, is one in which the starting player could always win if he knew the strategy. An indeterminate game is one which two perfect players would play forever.&#10;&#10;The L game was the result. Each player has only one piece.

There are also three cards which allow you to change the order of the central cube pattern.&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player's pawns match the central pattern.

They follow the same format as our other rules used in the Trilogy, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers, and novices alike. Tactical turns represent 3 minutes, with intermediate turns (for long distance maneuvering and long stern chases) representing 30 minutes. Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds firing at the target, and speeds of the firing and target platforms. Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical damage is a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon amounts).&#10;&#10;The 40+ scenarios include the well known &quot;biggies&quot; such as Jutland (broken into three parts, as well as the grand battle) and Dogger Bank, and many smaller engagements. Often there are variants given, covering important &quot;almosts&quot; and &quot;what ifs&quot;.

        "description": "Cashflow 101 is a serious game designed by investor, businessman, and self-help author Robert Kiyosaki to serve as a tool for learning basic financial strategies and accounting principles. Cashflow 101 is the first of several games created by Kiyosaki to reinforce the information in his books.&#10;&#10;The board has two tracks: A &quot;Rat Race&quot; small circle where you only roll one die to advance, and a &quot;Fast Track&quot; where you roll two dice to advance. In the Rat Race you get paid for passing your Paycheck space, and then draw from one of four decks of cards depending on which space you've landed. Some of the deals are good, others are bad. Your main problem here is a shortage of cash. In the Fast Track your main problem is an excess of cash and finding investments to sink it into before you lose it to lawsuits, divorce or tax audits.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game though are the player sheets where players learn how to fill out a financial statement. Players choose from a variety of starting careers (Truck Driver, Mechanic, Lawyer, Airline Pilot, etc.) and fill out their financial sheets appropriately. As they land cards and invest in different deals they dutifully log each change to their financial sheets as well. After a few games most people end up using the same financial sheets to fill out their own personal information.&#10;&#10;With each card event the drawing player may buy at that price, but all players may sell at that price. Also, players may make co-investments with the drawing player or even buy the deal from him if they agree. Player deals are encouraged.&#10;&#10;The game with few players is heavily biased towards real estate. With 5-6 players the cards are being drawn fast enough that the part time businesses pay off as well.&#10;&#10;There are thousands of Cashflow 101 game clubs around the world.&#10;&#10;",

The dice are eight-sided, printed in full color, and about 2 inches to a side. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles with just tabs and slots. The &quot;paper&quot; in these paper dice is 12-point coated cardstock, which makes these dice solid enough to withstand any amount of normal play.&#10;&#10;Diceland: Space is a 50-die expansion for Diceland, which comes in two different 25-die boxes. The set introduces new abilities like Cloak, Remove, Dodge, and more, and gives players their first chance to construct customized Diceland armies. Each box contains two major armies, one smaller one, and a strange and wonderful 25th die.&#10;&#10;Space: Terrans vs. Urluquai includes an 11-die Terran army, featuring a fast-moving wing of Scouts and a powerful 15-point Destroyer; the 8-die Urluquai army including both a Corvette and a Fighter with the Cloaking ability; and the 5-die Zorg army, with a fat carrier and a unique Tender which can teleport enemies off the board. Also in the Terrans vs. Urluquai box, you&rsquo;ll find the friendly Klakar Frigate, an impressive 16-point frigate that&rsquo;s a perfect addition to any army that can afford him.&#10;&#10;Space: Garthans vs. Muktians includes an 11-die Garthan army, featuring both the Light and Super Carriers as well as a vast array of small Fighters; the 8-die Muktian army featuring a mix of unusual ship designs; and the 5-die Tan Ru army, featuring a powerhouse 15-point Decimator and a wing of three mindless Drones. Also in the Garthans vs. Muktians box, you'll find the 50-point Yellow Kawangi die, a bizarre and powerful die that's sure to be illegal in tournaments any day now.&#10;&#10;List of Diceland sets and armies&#10;&#10;",

However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun.

And, while the full game of the latter battle uses 3 maps and a lot of your time, there are two standard one-map battles and three smaller scenarios highlighting engagements within the bigger battles that use few counters and take only a couple of hours to play!&#10;&#10;",
