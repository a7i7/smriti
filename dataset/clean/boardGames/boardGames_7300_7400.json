Not one piece of cheese is safe, and he risks becoming stuck in the mouse holes with his big belly. He really should have memorized by now which holes he can pass through after eating one, two, or more pieces of cheese! He also has to avoid the quick pet cat, Kiki, who always seems to be ready to pounce on the next mouse hole. Who can help Gary memorize the best way to the target mouse hole and collect the most pieces of cheese?&#10;&#10;The bottom of the Gary Gouda box contains the game board, which resembles an apartment with 16 rooms arranged in a square and archways connecting each pair of rooms. Before the game begins, players slide archway tiles into the walls to adjust the heights of the various archways at random. The cat token is placed in front of any orange mouse hole to keep his eyes out for Gary.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player wants to move Gary from a corner of the house, pick up at least one pieces of cheese, and make it safely to the target corner without being seen by Kiki. To set up a player's turn, he draws four cheese slices, then places them in the rooms designated on the slices; he rolls the color die to determine where Gary starts and where he must move to. He is then free to move Gary through any archways possible &ndash; as long as he doesn't enter Kiki's sight &ndash; to reach one or more pieces of cheese. Gary eats this cheese immediately, with the player stacking Gary on the cheese slice to make the mouse fatter. If Gary ever gets stuck trying to fit through an archway, then the player's turn ends and any cheese on Gary is removed from the game; if a player reaches the corner, he claims any cheese eaten.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player can't place out four slices of cheese. Whoever has collected the most cheese wins!&#10;&#10;",

They have within reach a whole range of projects that the city council wants to achieve, but which lack the funds. By skillfully selecting plans, using available space and deciding which projects their money should be spent on they will be expanding the city and competing for the title of the most people-friendly company.&#10;&#10;During play, the game board is expanded by players laying down tiles, with each tile representing a piece of the city, a district that might need to be provided with electricity or water in exchange for receiving some benefit. Some of the tiles require a supply of luxury goods; others generate them; others give only points of happiness, such as the hospital.&#10;&#10;Resources are common, and each of them can be bought by players from power stations and waterworks. These resources, however, are not unlimited and their use must be well planned. Keep in mind, too, that you must pay opponents when transporting raw materials through districts they own.&#10;&#10;Game play in City Tycoon passes through four stages, and in each of them the buildings get larger and more impressive while at the same time requiring more resources and giving better benefits. Players quickly notice the relations between them and may choose several possible strategies to develop their investments, for example, focusing on making money, constructing scoring buildings to the exclusion of all else. Each of these strategies has its pluses and minuses, and the actions of other players might force you to expand in new directions and change your tactic.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!&#10;&#10;Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.&#10;&#10;In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!&#10;&#10;Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.&#10;&#10;On your turn:&#10;&#10;     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. &#10;     Then take one action:&#10;         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.&#10;         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.&#10;         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.&#10;         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated. Most VP wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This description is spoiler free, containing nothing outside the initial rulebook for the game. Details on why this is important in the description.&#10;&#10;Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &quot;red stars&quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).&#10;&#10;What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.&#10;&#10;What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &quot;match three symbols&quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.&#10;&#10;The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.&#10;&#10;The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &quot;major bonus,&quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a &quot;disposable&quot; game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique, and plays better than any other version of Risk.&#10;&#10;Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you take two actions from six possibilities, with the same action being possible:&#10;&#10;&mdash;Top up: Discard any number of cards (including zero), then refill your hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Jump: Move your spaceship from the jump gate (where players start the game) or a planet to any other planet by discarding a card that shows the landing value of the target planet. Place one of your tokens on the jump gate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Fly: Move your spaceship to either neighboring planet; this move is free.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Scan: Discard a card with the scanning value of the planet where your spaceship is currently located; look through the face-down planet tiles, place one aside face-down with your marker on it, then return the tiles to that planet. This action is possible only on undeveloped planets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Develop: Develop the planet where your spaceship is located by discarding two cards that match the two landing values shown on that planet. Mark this planet with your space station token, hand out all scanned and claimed planet tiles to the appropriate players, claim one remaining planet tile for yourself, then place the remaining tiles face-down again.

When 6-12 space tiles have been revealed, an amount based on the number of players, the game ends and players tally their points.&#10;&#10;Each type of planet tile scores in a different way.

Not in this naughty game of cards &ndash; in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.&#10;&#10;In Mogel Motte you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug &ndash; which stays on the table throughout the game &ndash; and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.&#10;&#10;There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug &ndash; and only him! &ndash; can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.&#10;&#10;Cheating is a necessity as the &quot;Cheating Moth&quot; cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)&#10;&#10;The action cards work as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.&#10;    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it.

Restlessly, they'll move their pieces on the game board, facing constant challenges in terms of making their beautiful villages on this beautiful island as profitable as possible. Only those who will be able to use their dwindling resources to meet the increasing demands over five rounds will find a spot for themselves on the beach.&#10;&#10;In Hawaii, players must make use of their limited resources to score points by growing their villages and exploring the surrounding islands. Your chieftains move around the board to purchase new tiles for their villages, hopefully grabbing the best deals before their opponents. Three different currencies are used to pay for these trips, so make sure you don't run out of any of them too quickly. Players are also rewarded for providing for their people (measured essentially by how much they bought on a given turn), but your meager income shrinks as the game goes on. Players will have to balance a number of ways to score points to secure their victory.&#10;&#10;",

Relationships &ndash; that is, defined relations between two races of aliens &ndash; are connected to the game actions of the players. Players use these relationships to occupy planets and have a majority there. Relationships are: Love (born new alien - Bastard), Hungry (eat enemy alien bastard - enemy is removed from the planet), War (shot enemy alien bastard which dead body will fill the planet), Trade, Friendship, Migration (traveling by spaceship), Mutation (transform to a different alien) and Political propaganda (changing the relationships).&#10;&#10;Space Bastards is a game in which you can enjoy and observe the picturesque aliens as small animals in an aquarium &ndash; while siccing them on your opponents, of course...&#10;&#10;",

To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original Funkenschlag, designer Friedemann Friese will take you back in time and let you relive the early beginnings of mankind. True to the name of the German edition (a literal translation of which is &quot;Flying Sparks&quot;), it is time for Funkenschlag: Die ersten Funken, or &quot;The First Sparks&quot;.&#10;&#10;The First Sparks transports the Funkenschlag mechanisms into the Stone Age. The order of phases during a game round, the player order, the technology cards: you know all these parts from &ldquo;Funkenschlag&rdquo;. But what is new? What is different?&#10;&#10;The First Sparks is much faster and far more direct. You are immediately part of the action. Each turn, each decision is important. As a clan leader you decide on the well-being of your clan during the Stone Age. You need to develop new hunting technologies and get new knowledge - to successfully hunt food or to learn to control fire. With the help of these skills, you will harvest enough food to feed your clan and spread it far enough to reach new hunting areas.&#10;&#10;In a game of The First Sparks you are always confronted with many decisions: Which technology cards offer you the biggest advantages? When is the right time to spread your clan on the game board? Which hunting areas will grant the most food? Reaching new hunting areas or trying to secure parts of the game board for your own clan are important factors for your strategy. Empty spaces are cheaper for you to settle compared to spaces in which other clans are already settled. If you are the first to increase your clan size to 13 clan members, you win The First Sparks.&#10;&#10;",

Some cards have actions and add a gesture such as sticking out your tongue or pounding the table.&#10;&#10;A round ends one of two ways: (1) A player is accused of messing up, with accusers pointing at him and saying &quot;Ho!&quot; If the accusation is correct, the player &quot;scores&quot; all cards in the center, plus one card from each accuser; if not, then the accusers split the cards among themselves. (2) A player adds his third card to the pile and correctly repeats all the sounds, ending with &quot;Ouga Bouga!&quot; As a reward, he distributes the cards in the center, as well as any penalty cards previously collected, among all the players.&#10;&#10;After a round ends, every player refills his hand to three cards and another round begins.

As you earn more, you can afford a favor or two: the police officer is kinder to you, you can hire a migrant worker to do extra work, and you can even finagle the attention of a promoter or a journalist!&#10;&#10;The families will need to co-operate from time to time; after all, those grand attractions don't build themselves. In the end, the grand attractions are what will impress the crowds and bring about euphoric headlines in the newspapers!&#10;&#10;To set up Coney Island, each player takes two money tiles, a random building material and a player board, covering most of the spaces on that board with showmen tiles. At the start of each turn, a player receives income. At the beginning of the game a player's income is one VP, one money and one randomly drawn building material; as the game progresses, the player can remove showmen tiles to uncover VP, money and material spaces, thereby boosting his income. A player can never have more than five money tiles and five materials.&#10;&#10;A player then takes one to three main actions and up to five special actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a building site tile. Pay the cost of the space you cover and receive the reward shown there (VPs, materials, an additional action)&#10;    Place a showmen tile. Pay the cost in building materials shown on your player board, then place this tile on an empty space on a building site. This boosts your income (by uncovering a space) and gives you and others potential places to build.&#10;    Place a grand attraction tile. These tiles cost 2-5 materials to build and cover 1-4 spaces, each of which must have a showman tile on it. Players receive points for their showmen used or attraction placed, then the showmen are returned to the appropriate player boards.&#10;&#10;&#10;By spending two money, a player can acquire one of five character tiles (either from the supply or another player); each character provides a special action that the player can use each turn, such as spending money or VPs for material or buying newspaper tiles (which are worth points and can be spent for an additional action).&#10;&#10;Each main action may be executed at most once per turn unless extra actions are used from newspapers or from bonuses earned by placing certain building site tiles.&#10;&#10;After one player reaches 60 VP, and each player has had the same number of turns, the game ends, with players scoring their newspaper tiles and losing points for each showman on their player boards.

The block of ice opens a hole in the right side of the hull and after two hours and forty minutes the Titanic is doomed.&#10;&#10;One hundred years after those happenings, Sir Chester Cobblepot offers a refined board game that celebrates the unforgettable heroism and determination of the passengers on that English transatlantic. More specifically, our main characters are the survivors of the last lifeboat lowered into the water, the collapsible D.&#10;&#10;The idea for Collapsible D: The Final Minutes of the Titanic comes from the mind of the Italian author Gianluca Santopietro. In this game the players are on board the Titanic during the night of April 14, 1912, starting at 11:40 p.m. when the ship collides with an iceberg; each turn represents ten minutes in real time. Each player controls a passenger of each Class and a member of the Crew. Each character has a different starting point, an attempt to recreate the exact location where they were on the ship, thanks to historical research led by the author in cooperation with history experts on the Titanic, such as Claudio Bossi. Thanks to an intuitive movement system, players will move their passengers through the ship, trying to reach the lifeboats on the dock.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the water floods in quickly and the risk of drowning is very high. Each saved passenger grants victory points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

You built a monster to rend them limb from limb, which your minions assured you was the very worst way to be rended. When it became clear that the only hope for the world was your own benign leadership, you took control of TV to announce this fact. But your broadcast was interrupted by someone else taking control of TV and announcing his own plan for world domination &ndash; and then that broadcast was interrupted by yet another interloper. So. Competition. Well, the world will never be as scared of these upstarts as it will be of you. Archimedes once said, &quot;Give me a long enough lever and a place to stand, and I will move the world.&quot; You will be the most terrifying lever the world has ever seen.&#10;&#10;Nefarious is a quick-playing game in which the players race to build inventions like a freeze ray, cloaking device, or robotic pet before their opponents can do the same. (Interesting side note: Eighteen different artists contributed to the artwork on the different inventions in the game.)&#10;&#10;Nefarious is played over several rounds. In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose. The first player to build 20 or more points worth of Inventions AND have more points than any other player wins.&#10;&#10;There is a twist to the game, though &ndash; actually, two twists! At the beginning of the game, you randomly draw two Twist cards, which change the environment so that the game plays differently each time. This means that in order to win, the players will have to revise their strategies each time they play Nefarious.&#10;&#10;",

His servants grow bold, stealing into our cities, inhabiting the alleys and dark places of our streets. They jeer at us from our mirrors, shaming our reflections.&#10;&#10;The books of the Council of Wardens, handed down to us across the years, say that the era of broken barriers is upon us. Omens tell us, by winter, the Grayking will break through the few defenses we have remaining, cross to Lassadar, and our lands will fall to despair.&#10;&#10;We few who are left, who remember the Grayking&rsquo;s original imprisonment across the Barrier Planes, struggle to keep his power from growing further, but we have little time and far too few disciples. You are young but have proven to hold the strength of our teaching inside you. We have trained you in the arcane arts of ice, oak and flint magic and have taught you those powers are capricious and can damage your spirit if relied upon too much. We wish we had more time to train you further. We do not.&#10;&#10;Go now into the wider world, with our blessings, and seek a means to defeat the Grayking. Find the three Warding Keys stolen by his servants and re-lock the gates to force him back behind the Barrier Planes forever. Our agents, spread thinly across places still untouched in Lassadar, will aid you in your quest as best they can.&#10;&#10;Go now, and save us all&hellip;&hellip;&#10;&#10;Shadows Upon Lassadar is a solitaire fantasy quest game. You play a young magic adept who has been charged with finding three lost keys to lock the gates between the Barrier Plains and prevent the Grayking from reaching the world of Lassadar. You will journey to different cities using a deck of cards; other cards list spells you learn during the game. Magic in Lassadar is, however, a two edged sword and if you use powerful spells you may end up corrupting your own spirit in the process and lose the game. Three specific cards lead to expanded battle maps where you fight the Grayking&rsquo;s servants for possession of the keys. The game uses a variety of AI mechanics to simulate an enemy that learns and adapts as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;Needed to play:&#10;the 48 game cards + the 4 last battle cards&#10;9 six sided dice&#10;25 black eurocubes&#10;and 3 eurocubes: one each in red, blue and yellow.&#10;&#10;This Print and Play game can be assembled as a deck of cards or as cards and a series of mini game boards.&#10;&#10;There are several types of quests in the game that will need to be completed. These quests are encountered by turning over cards from the draw deck:&#10;&#10;City Quest cards showing the name of the city you&rsquo;ve journeyed to, win and loss table reference icons and event instructions for the battle in that city. As you win battles in these cities you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles.&#10;&#10;Council of Wardens Quest cards always have a white top. Their event instructions will help you gain spells and refresh your Mana and Spirit. These cards will always be placed on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game.&#10;&#10;Three Warding City Quest cards, each with a colored band and a numbered Warding Key icon across the bottom will signal when you use the Expanded Battle Maps (wargame hexmap style). On the Expanded Battle Maps you will encounter AI driven servants of the Grayking. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles. As you win the battles in these cities, and gain the Warding Keys, you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile, to be shuffled back into the game.&#10;&#10;Winning or losing the game:&#10;&#10;Draw cards one by one working your way through the quest. If you gain each of the 3 Warding keys you may cast the Oaken Spell: Barrier Lock and lock the gates of the Barrier Plains. The Grayking is instantly drawn back to the Tower of Ash and you have saved Lassadar and won the game.&#10;&#10;If at any time your Spirit falls below [1] on the Character Stats card, or if the Grayking reaches Lassadar on the Progress Track, you have lost the game.&#10;&#10;2nd place in the August 2011 Solitaire Print and Play contest &#10;and was also awarded Best Art, Best AI and Best Horror Game&#10;&#10;Tied for 1st place in The 2011 Print 'n Play Awards for Best Solitaire Game&#10;&#10;2012 Golden Geek Awards Nominee - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/864240/2012-golden-geek-awards-nominees-announced-vot&#10;&#10;",

Whichever player has played the highest card moves her explorer token to the first unoccupied space in front of the group, then the player with the next highest card moves her token, and so on. If two or more players reveal the same number, only the one farthest back in the group moves; all other such explorers remain where they started the round. (Kali moves like an explorer. If you play a zero or are at the front of the group when you are supposed to move, you don't move.)&#10;&#10;If a player's token lands on a dung heap, she scores three penalty points. If Kali lands in the dung, the player(s) who played the lowest number that round take the penalty instead of Kali.&#10;&#10;Whenever Kali or an explorer token leave the space immediately in front of Mambo, the rhino charges, moving until it rams into the token in back of the line and giving that player as many penalty points as the number of spaces Mambo ran.

        "description": "Aquileia, the second most important city of the Roman Empire, had been originally founded as an outpost against the Barbarian invaders. From its military origin comes the peculiar quadrilateral structure divided by the main streets. Later, the city developed to become an important political and cultural center and a prosperous trading city, especially for precious goods, thanks to its convenient and efficient river port. Important monuments such as the Gladiator Arena, the horse-racing Stadium, and the famous theater were built, as well as craftsmen's workshops, patrician villas which completed the architectural network of the city.&#10;&#10;In Aquileia, players want to become the most powerful figure in the city by trading and building. Each player, representing a wealthy Aquileian patrician, owns a certain number of henchmen (pawns) which he uses for these main activities: sports playing, culture, trading, and building. Each activity can bring expenses, earnings and sometimes victory points (VPs).&#10;&#10;Each round begins with a placement phase in which players take turns placing their henchmen on action spaces and their tiebreaker disc on the tiebreaker track. Placing the tiebreaker is mandatory; placing henchmen is not (but you probably want to place them). Once everyone has passed or placed all of their tokens, players resolve the action spaces in numerical order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Mercatus allows players to buy weapons, arms and slave cards, collect money through a die roll, claim four blue dice for use with the Arena and Stadium, and trade one currency for another. (This is the only way to make change, and some actions require specific currencies; if you must pay bronze and have only silver and gold, then you cannot take that action!)&#10;    At the Arena, players compare fighting strength, with that number determined by the starting strength on the action space claimed, the roll of three dice and the playing of slave and weapon cards. The winner gets three bronze coins and either double his strength in VPs or a slave card. The second and third best players receive lesser rewards.&#10;    The Stadium is similar to the Arena, with the horse cards coming into play and the winner receiving gold or silver coins and his choice of two laurel cards; laurel cards deliver 3-10 VPs or are a multiplier for endgame scoring.&#10;    The Theatrum brings a bid for a dual-colored laurel card, with players needing to ante and raise in particular currencies. &#10;    In the Forum, players build villas and private banks, sometimes scoring points for doing so when they pay the specific costs with the proper coins.&#10;    Finally, the Portus gives players a chance to activate their buildings, thereby earning them VPs or money.&#10;&#10;&#10;After six rounds, the game ends and players score VPs for their hidden point cards and the product of their villas' values times laurel cards of a matching color. (For example, a total of 8 points of blue villas and three blue villa cards equals 24 points.) The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

It includes three battles: Foz do Arouce, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and El Bodon 1811 which are thus be the 32nd, 33rd and 34th battles of the series.&#10;&#10;The game is also the 6th entry in the Vae Victis Wargame Collection. The main battle, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, has an A2 map and the two smaller ones have A3 maps. The game include 216 counters and markers.&#10;&#10;Foz do Arouce, 15th March 1811&#10;The fight took place just after Redhina and Casal Novo but before Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, as Wellington followed Massena out of the lines of Torres Vedras. It included two popular British divisions, the 3rd and the Light. The French under Ney held a ridge with a river behind it that was crossed by a single bridge. The French ridge on their left was much higher than the one on the right. In the centre there was a gap of about 200 yards, occupied by the village of Foz d'Arouce. Some companies of the 95th rifles penetrated down a hollow road there, almost unopposed, quite close to the bridge. The rest of the Light division held Marchand in a frontal fight on the French right. Half of Mermet&rsquo;s division on the French left faced the 3rd Division. The 39th lost its eagle in the river as they tried to cross a deep ford below the bridge, and many men were drowned.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, 3rd to 5th May 1811&#10;On the 3rd of May, Mass&eacute;na launched a frontal assault against the British-Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while subjecting the British-Portuguese on the heights east of the village to a heavy artillery bombardment. The village was the centre of the fighting for the whole day, with French soldiers of Ferey's and Marchand's divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions. May 4 saw little combat. Both sides recovered from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington's right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Pozo Bello. Action began again at dawn on the 5th of May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Mass&eacute;na launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King's German Legion cavalry. In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th Ca&ccedil;adores. Led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot, this effort broke Drouet's attack and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. Drouet launched a second attack on the town. This time it was led by three battalions of converged grenadiers from IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. Drouet threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Clapar&egrave;de's divisions, seizing almost the entire town. The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington's cannon. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington's men entrenched during the evening.&#10;&#10;El Bodon 25th September 1811&#10;The fight included a French cavalry force of 2500, against a mixed force of Picton&rsquo;s 3rd Division consisting of 1000 men, 500 cavalry and two Portuguese batteries. The French attacked in 3 columns of cavalry with a 4th column in reserve, &quot;since only parts of the hillside were open ground suitable for cavalry.&quot; The attack fell upon the isolated part of Wallace&rsquo;s Brigade covering the road. As the French columns came up the slope they were attacked by Alten&rsquo;s light cavalry one squadron at a time &quot;with the slope in their favour.&rdquo; The individual squadrons then rallied behind their supports. The British had to hold on, to allow time for the widely separated parts of 3rd Division to retire.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de Onoro 1811 includes:&#10;&#10;    A 59 x 40 cm map,&#10;    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,&#10;    A color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Units : Regiments and brigades&#10;Map scale : 500 m/hex.&#10;Turn : 120 minutes&#10;&#10;Complexity : 6 / 9&#10;&#10;Bilingual Rules and Charts (English/French).&#10;&#10;",

Each landscape tile has 21 hexagonal areas in a big triangle and each area has a terrain type such as mountain, wood, swamp and so on, and the tile may also include a predator lair. Different terrain types have their benefits and challenges. The combination and orientation of different landscape tiles make the way forward uncertain and new every game. To top it off, the players have a limited supply of cards that can be played to help yourself or thwart your opponent in certain situations.&#10;&#10;Besides the normal six-tile board, the game can be played in an easy, short version by having only four landscape tiles, or it can be played in a challenging long version by including all eight available landscape tiles.&#10;&#10;The hand-made edition of Wilderness sold out at Spiel 2011. FryxGames is releasing a professionally published version in the first half of 2012, and this version will have improved game play and graphics. For example, search for food has replaced hunting. It is not very likely that you have the equipment you need to hunt. Instead, food will be slightly easier to find but will not fill your stomach as much as before.&#10;&#10;",

The survivors are trying to make it day to day in a world torn apart from the walking dead.&#10;&#10;As in any survival game, one needs food, guns, ammo, and more. Players go out into the wasteland and scavenge for supplies, or perhaps to find a new gun or melee weapon to fend off the next zombie attack. In addition to gathering supplies, each player forms and controls his own squad &ndash; and each squad works to fortify the bases. Your walls and barbed wire won&rsquo;t hold the dead for long, however, and they&rsquo;re getting hungry.&#10;&#10;Characters receive victory points for killing zombies, building defenses, and successfully completing goals. Victory points show who is soldiering on the best in this wasteland. The final tally of points determines the winner. Victory points also act as experience points for leveling up a character.&#10;&#10;The game combines combat, tactics, resource collecting, character development, team play, and strategy towards the goal of surviving in the Zpocalypse!&#10;&#10;",

But it's not as easy as it first may appear as other Tuareg are secretly hiding their goods in caves and may steal away some of your business when they unexpectedly show up with goods that are more valuable than yours.&#10;&#10;Tuareg consists of two stages in which each player tries to gain a majority of the various resources. At the end of each stage points are awarded for a majority of a resource, as well as for strategically played special cards (donkeys, caves, thieves and maps).&#10;&#10;To set up the game, a number of special cards are laid out face up according to the number of players, and the top two resource cards are placed face up in the market. On a turn, a player can:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw three resource cards from the deck, placing one in the market and holding on to the rest (up to a maximum hand size of four, with excess cards also going to the market).&#10;    Load one of your camels with goods from your hand. Each camel can hold up to four cards, with at most two types of goods. Water can't be mixed with another resource, and a camel can carry no more than two gold.&#10;    Take up to four cards of the same type from the market and load them onto a camel following the loading rules.&#10;    Buy a special card for 3 dinars, paying for the cost by discarding cards from hand or the top of a camel's load.&#10;&#10;&#10;The special cards give you additional places to store cards (donkey or cave, each with different rules), a way to steal cards (thief) and a way to score bonus points (map).&#10;&#10;Once the resource deck runs out, players take one more turn, then sort their resource cards on camels and donkeys and in caves in piles of particular types; whoever has the most or ties for the most of a type scores points. Used special cards are returned to their stacks, and players can optionally cash in unused special cards for one point each (or two points for a map). Players then shuffle the resource cards and play a second stage following the same rules, starting with cards in hand from the first stage.

By 1307, the &ldquo;poor comrades-in-arms&rdquo; were one of the richest organizations in Europe: one that would attract the covetous eyes of the French king.&#10;&#10;In The Mystery of the Templars, players become the masters of this secretive organization. They must assign their knights to the critical task of escorting pilgrims, but also to seek out and discover long-lost artifacts of Christian lore. Using their holdings in the Holy Land, they procure valuable trade goods, which must then be transported to the hungry markets of Europe, using the profits to expand the Order&rsquo;s holdings. But along the way brigands and pirates threaten the flow of goods and wealth, and must be challenged by valorous knights to safeguard the precious caravans and trade ships. To be successful, the players must balance the needs of trade, development, and battle.&#10;&#10;In time, the powerful enemies of the Templars will strike, beginning the Persecution which will eventually cause the destruction of the Order. In those last desperate days, the players must flee from their Commanderies with all the wealth and relics they can carry, seeking refuge in the farthest corners of the world. The player who can best manage the resources of the Order during the days of wealth, and who can rescue the most important relics from the Persecution, will be the victor in The Mystery of the Templars.&#10;&#10;",

Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&#10;    Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&#10;    Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&#10;&#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&#10;&#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel.

The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned  (triangle) raceway.&#10;&#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best.

In 1625, the Thirty Years' War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &quot;years,&quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one's control &ndash; wins.&#10;&#10;In each of the &quot;action&quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.&#10;&#10;After revealing that round's event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can't deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.&#10;&#10;Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower's baffles to possibly emerge in the future.&#10;&#10;Wallenstein includes two expansions: &quot;Emperor's Court,&quot; in which a player's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &quot;Landsknechte,&quot; which can be used with &quot;Emperor's Court&quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order.

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Gunship: First Strike! is Escape Pod Games' core release in a planned series of tactical space combat games. Players fight to win battles in a futuristic civil war with a variety of ship types. From the agile and speedy Fighters, to lethal Gunships and intimidating Capital Ships, every battle is a well-balanced slugfest that comes right down to the wire. Our new Trinity Mechanic uses boards, cards and dice together in an extremely innovative and easy-to-learn system that lets new players jump right in.&#10;&#10;What makes the Gunship series unique are the numerous combinations of ships that the players &quot;build&quot; at the start of each battle. By choosing from an ever-growing selection (through expansions) of available Weapons and Upgrades, players are able to create a custom Gunship that is suited to their particular style of play or battle situation. Some guys are &quot;defensive&quot; minded; they'll choose Heavy Armor, +1 Shield Generators and 4 Blaster Cannons to fend off the enemy Gunship. But another player might prefer to build a &quot;Carrier Killer&quot; complete with wings full of Bombs and an Autoblaster Cannon to shred his way through the enemy Fighter Squadron. While most of the Upgrade cards are geared toward the Gunships (the true star of the show) you can also do some great things to your Fighters and Capital Ships. New kinds of ships will come with every expansion to further add to the possibilities. No two battles are ever the same!&#10;&#10;In Gunship: First Strike!, the civil war has just started. Your orders are simple: Command a task force of one Assault Carrier and its Gunship and Fighters on a mission to destroy the enemy's Carrier. Guess what? He has the very same orders! Dogfights will ensue, Torpedoes will strike home and Thruster Bombs are going to pound the Capital Ships mercilessly. If your Gunship takes too much damage for comfort, or if the battle situation changes and you want a different weapon load, land inside your Carrier for a quick &quot;pit stop&quot;. Make sure that you defend it with all your might because once your Carrier is gone, the only option left to you is to flee the battlespace and hope to take revenge another day.&#10;&#10;As the Gunship universe grows, players will be able to fight bigger and bigger battles. Soon the objectives will include breaking through the enemy picket line to drop troops on the planet below. The Gunships will be called upon to not only assault other ships, but also to go dirtside and give air support to the land battle raging below  A free Campaign System is planned where players can keep track of a fleet of ships and territories. Lose your Carrier in today's battle and you might lose a critical Outpost next week. Don't let the enemy find the Shipyard where your damaged Destroyers limped home last time &ndash; if he does, they're toast!&#10;&#10;",

These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.&#10;&#10;The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &mdash; failure &mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.&#10;&#10;Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.&#10;    Two independent player-influenced game timers &mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock &mdash; provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.&#10;    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.&#10;    A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.&#10;    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.&#10;&#10;",

The result is that Nations in Arms is an entirely new, and very playable, Napoleonic epic from designer Fran&#195;&#167;ois-Stanislas Thomas.&#10;&#10;Players control every major and minor power of the Napoleonic period: from the largest participants to the smallest. This allows anywhere from 2 to 7 players to participate in the game. Players are challenged with strategically managing their annual national production, diplomacy, and most importantly, war.&#10;&#10;The game systems emphasize the military importance of lines of communication, the command and control ability of skilled leaders, quality of troops above quantity, and the impact of battle, epic sieges and attrition on a nation. You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.&#10;&#10;Each game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns. A Chit Activation system is used to recreate the &lsquo;chaos of war&rsquo;, and events occur using an Historical Event card deck. This combination of variable chit pull and card play ensures a high replay value of the ten (10) scenarios.

If nobody has conquered the world by the end of the 4th turn to win immediately, the player whose empire got the largest at any given point wins.&#10;&#10;Each card can be played in one of 3 ways: Generals allow you to place a pawn in that card's territory to be used for rerolls in combats in or adjacent to the territory.  Playing cards as agents gives you one time effects that reflect that historical figure's abilities (Stalin assassinates, Victoria adds an extra die on a naval attack).  Playing cards as rulers gives you their ability for the duration of your turn and sets a goal that reaching it will net you a power bonus at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you're issued a number of tokens.  This number escalates by one during each player turn to ramp up the epic nature of the game.  You also get the bonus when somebody plays a ruler (including you) in one of your territories, and you'll get it at the end of your turn if you reach your ruler's goals. Tokens convert into armies controlling territories in successful attacks and are spent to pay for failed attacks and sea attacks as a Supply Cost.  Each time you pay the Supply Cost, it escalates.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay Details&#10;&#10;On your turn, you campaign by throwing one die for each territory you control adjacent to a target territory. The defender throws one die for their defending army plus another for each adjacent territory they control. The highest die wins. Losses and Naval attacks have an escalating Supply Cost. When you are unwilling or unable to pay the Supply cost, your turn ends. Make it count, though, because you only get four turns.&#10;&#10;Strategic depth is layered onto this simple system by the deck of conqueror cards. Each historical figure has special powers based on their history, such as Erik the Red making unsupplied naval attacks, or Stalin using assassination to eliminate enemies. The cards may be played as your empire's ruler (which makes their power last your whole turn), a local agent (which gives you the power just once), or a general (which ignores their power but gives you combat rerolls). Ruler cards also have a strategic goal, such as Elizabeth's &ldquo;No one else controls a continent&rdquo; or Caesar's &ldquo;Win 5 attacks.&rdquo; Fulfilling these goals gets you a power bonus at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;In the grand tradition of global conquest games, World Conquerors is epic in scope, but it addresses the genre's traditional shortcomings.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Short Play Time - just four turns per player each game. It plays in about an hour. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     No Player Elimination - each turn you get a new ruler, regardless of the last one's fate.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Quick combat resolution - one army per territory makes battles quick and easy, focusing strategy on card play instead of mass dicefests. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reduced Kingmaking and Spoiling - ruler goals drive the action leaving little room for spite. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     No Hopeless Positions - supply is based on both time and territory, so it's possible to rebuild a shattered empire from no territories at all.

A resource or worker action can be taken only if both spaces are filled in the appropriate column; when a player takes an action, he removes all action counters in the column, returns them to the bag, then takes the action.&#10;&#10;&bull; The &quot;research facility&quot; action must be carried out first, with the player taking the designated resources from the supply and placing one resource in any location that doesn't already have that resource available.&#10;&#10;&bull; The worker actions allow a player to place a salesman in a stock exchange, place a worker in Vladivostok, move workers up to three spaces, move a manager to any action space, or claim an investment tile; each investment tile corresponds to a particular resource or worker action and is placed on the player panel permanently, allowing the player to take this action more easily in the future since the column is always half-filled.&#10;&#10;&bull; Each resource action allows a player to remove that resource from all areas where he has a worker, then immediately sell them on one of the stock exchanges where he has a salesman.&#10;&#10;A player can keep up to ten action counters on his playing panel at the end of a round, allowing him to prepare for and build up actions for future rounds. The game ends at the end of any round in which three of the five resources have no supply remaining or eight areas have had all their resources removed. (Once an area is exhausted, nothing can be placed in it for the remainder of the game.) The player who has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

That is for you to decide.&#10;&#10;Zong Shi blends worker placement, resource management, project completion and special action cards. To set up the game, lay out the project cards (eight types, each with a special power) and masterwork projects (only three at a time) on the game board; draw goods randomly for the two markets; lay out the exchange tiles in the pawn shop; and lay out a certain number of Scrolls of Fortune and material tiles. Players take turns drafting Scrolls (which have one-shot abilities) and materials (needed to complete projects), then the first round begins.&#10;&#10;In each round, players take one action with their master or apprentice, then take one action with their other figure.

Everyone starts out as healthy as possible, with some money ($1) in the pocket, too. Each round, a number of event cards equal to one more than the number of players is revealed. In turn, each player will choose an event card and suffer the effects of that card, moving her health indicators as needed. Did you run out of gas? Or have a bout of diarrhea? Man, life sucks.&#10;&#10;Players then simultaneously deploy three action markers to indicate where they plan to go that day: the supermarket, the office, a pharmacy, a flea market, the gym, and so on. In turn order, players then execute all three of their actions in whatever order they desire. Maybe you'll hit the office to earn money, but at the cost of having your depression grow more intense. A trip to the supermarket will let you buy food, which you can then eat later at home or give to your neighbors who come to the party you throw. Force them to eat cake and get fat! If you have extra money on hand, you might want to visit the pharmacy to buy drugs; you never know what the pharmacist will give you, but if you don't like it (or the food you've acquired), you can hit the flea market to swap food and drugs &ndash; and maybe pick up some change in the bargain.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, you check your health levels to see whether your body is deteriorating without you even knowing.

Players, in the reverse order of their position on the score track, choose their actions one by one by setting their Action markers on the available places on the Action cards. Actions can be: moving the druids (they only move on the path surrounding the glade), setting a magical stone (a magical stone is set at the intersection of the magical beams emitted by two druids looking at the glade, this costs energy; the magical beams do not cross obstacles), capturing creature(s) (a druid may capture a creature in front of him with his magical beam; this costs energy but gives MP and sometimes special properties), progressing in knowledge tracks (to increase the capacity of moving, or to increase the influence at the druid council, for &shy;instance), preparing magical beverages (to increase knowledge but also to recover energy), moving a magical stone (it is possible to move a magical stone), acquiring Power cards (they give special powers, such as allowing the magical beam to pass through a wall), and influencing a creature (allows to move a creature).&#10;     Actions are performed. Actions are performed marker by marker, from left to right, starting with the major actions before doing the minor ones.
