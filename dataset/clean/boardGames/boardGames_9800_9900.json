Two of the most impressive personalities of that time were Leonard Euler and Maria Sibylla Merian (who in fact were related). Leonard Euler was a famous mathematician who rendered outstanding services to the number pi. Maria Sibylla Merian was not only a naturalist and explorer but also an artist. Her name stands for the style of detailed portrayal of nature &ndash; see her works on the metamorphosis of caterpillars to butterflies. The illustrations in this card game shall breathe life into that style again.&#10;&#10;The name Pi mal Pflaumen is a play on the expression &quot;Pi mal Daumen&quot; &mdash; &quot;rule of thumb&quot; or &quot;roughly&quot; &mdash; which also originated in that period, but now instead of thumbs, players are concerned with fruit. On a turn, players play one fruit card from their hand at a time, then they each claim one of the played cards based on the strength of the card that they played. Each card depicts a fruit, and some of the cards also feature a scoring pattern (e.g., hand in three identical fruits or two pairs of matching fruits) or a special action, such as collecting an additional plum card, stealing a card from an opponent, taking the dog to protect yourself from theft, or collecting three &pi; cards (which can be played singly or in combination with a number card to increase the value of your initial play).&#10;&#10;After a number of turns based on the number of players, the round ends, then players receive a new hand of cards. After three rounds, players tally their points based on completed contracts and whoever has the high score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Breeding, achieved by flipping over a creature's counter, generates new cards. Movement facilitates further breeding and the chance to secure tokens for additional icons and point scoring.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, points are scored through abilities on the creature's cards, the position of the creatures' counters on the boards, and from tokens; the player with the most points wins.

In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;",

It adds additional layers into what was already a dynamically strategic game.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect to play is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.&#10;&#10;Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn.

The Board Game, you are one of the pioneering and industrious species of a Galactic Federation. Together with your fellow colonists, you attempt to settle the distant Planet Irata with the so-called help of a mule-like machine you all learn to hate. But for now, he's all you've got.

The Store uses Smithore to manufacture M.U.L.E.s. Since players need M.U.L.E.s to produce their Goods, they must sell Smithore to increase their production.&#10;- Crystite is a luxury mineral with a highly volatile price.

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&#10;&#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Watson &amp; Holmes es un juego de deducci&oacute;n basado en la admirable obra de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. &#10;Cada uno de los dos a siete jugadores adoptar&aacute; el papel del Dr. John Watson y acompa&ntilde;ar&aacute; a Sherlock Holmes en la investigaci&oacute;n de una serie de casos in&eacute;ditos hasta ahora, intentando resolver cada uno de ellos antes de que el gran detective le brinde la soluci&oacute;n correcta.

Cada localizaci&oacute;n no puede ser visitada por m&aacute;s de un jugador, de manera que, en caso de que dos o m&aacute;s quieran dirigirse a la misma, el jugador que m&aacute;s corra (utilizando un mayor n&uacute;mero de fichas de Carruaje) obtendr&aacute; la pista correspondiente, debiendo los dem&aacute;s dirigirse a otras localizaciones.&#10;Una vez cada jugador obtenga un destino, todos proceder&aacute;n a leer en secreto la pista aparejada a la localizaci&oacute;n correspondiente, pudiendo tomar discretamente las anotaciones que estimen pertinentes.

All those investments influence the recycling and incineration phase, which provides players with waste cards, that will be processed in the last phase in order to bring revenue.&#10;&#10;After the last, 10th round the game finishes and the time comes for assessment of the players efforts. Victory points are awarded for proper investments and gained money. The players may also be punished with negative points for garbage cards and waste cards that they discarded during the game. After summing up the victory and negative points, the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;Waste processing has never been this much fun!&#10;&#10;",

Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf&eacute; into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your caf&eacute; become the Grand Austria Hotel.&#10;&#10;The start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.&#10;&#10;But no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.&#10;&#10;With 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value. Each game stands on its own and demands new tactics and strategies.&#10;&#10;",

Players then tally their points: For each completed column on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the number in that column's pentagon.

You win by being the first player to play all of your tiles.&#10;&#10;The first player selects one tile from their rack and places it in the center square on the board. The next player, and then each in turn, can add one tile to the board, but that tile must be set adjacent to one or more existing tiles, and it must match each adjacent tile based on either color or shape. If you match more than one tile, or you place your tile on one of the sun squares on the board, you get stones that can be traded in for extra moves, allowing you to get rid of your tiles faster. You can also use the special wind tiles to move a tile already on the board over by one square.&#10;&#10;As you play Latice, you&rsquo;ll learn to plan your turns and extra moves ahead of time. You&rsquo;ll strategically use wind tiles to alter the layout of the board, and play both offensively and defensively based on your knowledge of the remaining tiles. Latice has no language, culture, age or gender barriers and can be played by just about anyone. It offers strategic gameplay for adults while still being simple enough for younger players.&#10;&#10;",

Each round is a magical duel between all the wizards, which includes six different types of magic: Blades, Fireball, Frost Wave, Lightning, Quake and Metamagic. These magic types will aid wizards in their duel.&#10;&#10;Players take turns casting an initial spell that will set the rule for the round, set the rank other players must beat, and earn them a potential Shard (VP). Players then take turns playing cards of equal or higher rank from their hands to the table; if they match the spell suit, they place a Shard on that card. The round ends when a player can no longer play a valid card from their hand. The player that could not play a card returns any Shards on their played cards back to the center, then takes card damage equal to the amount of Shards that are still on cards. All other players then take the Shards on cards they played to their Victory Pool. The player who played the last card gets a bonus Shard.&#10;&#10;When a player takes damage, they draw cards from the deck equal to the amount of damage and place them face down in front of them. If they ever accumulate 5+ damage, they immediately discard their hand and a Shard, then take their damage cards in to their hand.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has enough Shards. 15 in a two-player game, 12 for three or four players, and 10 for five or six.&#10;&#10;",

In all modes other than the Dragon Raid, you start each round by shuffling the deck and setting aside 5 cards without looking at them.

        "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Mega Civilization, a huge version of the legendary development game Civilization, is a game of skill for 5 to 18 players covering the historical development of ancient civilizations from just after the last Ice Age to the dawn of the new era at the end of the Iron Age &mdash; a time span of almost 8,000 years. Each player leads their own civilization as it tries to expand its culture over a map board that stretches from the Mediterranean Sea to India.&#10; Although battles and territorial strategy are important, Mega Civilization is not a wargame as you might expect when looking at the map board. Instead, the objective of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, scientific, political, civic, and religious factors. The player who most effectively balances these various goals will achieve the best scores and win.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the objective of Mega Civilization is to acquire the highest number of victory points (VPs) by building cities and developing Civilization Advances. This will be done over various phases and turns, some of which will be performed simultaneously by the players. After each turn, a check is made for each player to move forward on the Archaeological Succession Table (A.S.T.). Each step on this timeline represents a certain period of time in history reaching from the Stone Age. Advancement there will provide even more VPs. The winner will not necessarily be the first player to reach the end of the A.S.T. or the player with the highest number of cities or Civilization Advances, although these are the key factors in determining the winner.&#10;&#10;Each civilization begins with a single population token, and every turn each player increases their population by adding tokens to each area they occupy. These tokens can be moved over the map board by land or (using ships) by sea. As each area has a population limit, a good strategic overview will give players advantage in occupying more and more areas. If a player manages to move sufficient tokens into an area, they can build a city there. These cities generate trade cards which will eventually lead to wealth. During trade sessions, players receive not only the commodities they need to complete sets; they might also receive calamities which will remove population or cities. Specific Civilization Advances will protect the players from natural or civic calamities. The development of these Civilization Advances is symbolized by turning in sets of trading goods, as the wealthier civilizations will acquire more Civilization Advances.&#10;&#10;As civilizations develop, it will be harder for their rulers to find the right balance between future population growth, maintaining enough support for their cities, and increasing their treasury. If they cannot manage their token population, their cities might eventually revolt during the tax collection phase. The civilizations with the strongest economy traditionally score the highest.&#10;&#10;A game of Mega Civilization can take 10-12 hours to complete. Players can also choose to play the beginner scenario &mdash; &quot;The First Game&quot; &mdash; which takes only 1-2 hours. Another scenario &mdash; &quot;The Short Game&quot; &mdash; provides the same excitement as the full game, although the game starts in a later age; by doing this, games can be played in &quot;only&quot; 6-8 hours.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever can get the most gold at the least cost is the winner.&#10;&#10;In more detail, Alchemidus is a speed puzzle, with players trying to be the fastest to find the cheapest way to convert clay to gold.&#10;&#10;The game has four pairs of d6 dice, in gold, lead, clay and white to show the process. The 2 gold and clay dice, and 1 of the lead dice are rolled and placed on their respective marker cards. The players must figure how to progress from the two clay numbers, to the one lead number, and then back to the two gold numbers.&#10;&#10;To do this, there are three rows of five cards dealt out from three small decks. One row has spells to remove a die, so you need that to go from clay to lead. Likewise, another row is spells to add a die, so you need that to go from lead to gold. The third row is to modify dice values. The spells are varied and often symmetrical, so you might have one spell saying &quot;If the total is &gt;=7, do...&quot; and another saying &quot;If the total is &lt;=7, do...&quot;, or a spell for odd numbered dice, and another for even numbers.&#10;&#10;Each spell card has a number on it, the cost of using that spell. The numbers go from 0 to 5 with five cards being 10 and one being 20 (Get any value die). Players must read the spells and quickly figure out the lowest cost method of going from clay to gold. It should always be possible, the spells have sufficient variety and there's enough of them.&#10;&#10;When one player declares a cost, the others have a little time to declare a lower cost. The player that proves the lowest formula wins the round.&#10;&#10;The game is well made, the dice and card stock are good quality.
