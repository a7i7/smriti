The important thing, of course, is that your team must be able to figure out what that object is before time runs out. Words come in two degrees of difficulty. Players advance on a score track as they guess words, but as you near the finish line, a die roll determines how you're handicapped: eyes closed, using only string, one hand, limited number of objects, etc. On your second-to-last turn, your opponents choose which three objects you can use to create the word that your team needs to guess in order to win.&#10;&#10;",

Place 1-4 tokens in the circle to account for the animals of this type that aren't visible.

If the player reveals the target animal, she earns one token from the circle; if the player reveals the fourth animal of this type, the player takes the final token, along with the animal card. Once all four animals of the desired type are visible, reveal the next card. Once all twelve cards have been used, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. Each token and animal card is worth one point, while the two elf cards are worth two points each.&#10;&#10;Game play in Taiga is nearly identical to that of Findevier, with the differences being (1) that the game has only ten animal cards and no elf cards; (2) that a player who reveals an incorrect animal must return a token to the bank; and (3) that each token is worth one point and each animal card is worth two points.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Zombies from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Zombies 2: Armed and Dangerous.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "ScrumBrawl is a board game where players control fantastic creatures vying for supremacy within the Arena, scoring goals by maneuvering various types of enchanted orbs into portals set within the Arena or fighting other creatures to the death to prevent them from reaching the portals. The 100-card deck contains fifty creatures with different characteristics that determine how the creature interacts with the orbs (throw accuracy, catching ability, and throwing range), how fast a creature can move, and how effective it is in battle. Many creatures also have unique magic abilities that can be used to manipulate gameplay.&#10;&#10;When players summon creatures, corresponding creature tokens (miniature cards that stand erect in cardstands) enter the 20x20 square gameboard, known as the Arena, where the orb and portal tokens await the contestants. In a four-player game, players may compete in teams of two. Goals are scored by creatures that maneuver an orb token onto a portal token by picking up, carrying, handing off, and throwing the orb with their creature tokens. Additionally, players can score goals (known as Skins) by successfully destroying opponents' creatures in combat. Combat results are determined by dice rolls as are the success of throws and catches of the orb between creatures. A number of Alter Reality cards allow players to change the values of individual rolls which make the outcome of every roll something that can quickly be challenged.&#10;&#10;Enchantment cards can be played on creatures to grant them enhanced stats or new abilities as well as make them hardier in combat. Event cards, such a Lightning Storms or Fumbles can change the flow the game in seconds forcing players to constantly rethink their strategies for scoring or engaging in combat.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player or team reaches three goals, one of which must be a non-skins goal. No lead is safe and no two matches are ever the same making each game a unique and often humorous experience. The name is the combination of Scrum (a Rugby term where players strive for possession of the ball) and Brawl (a roaring fight, in our case, to the death). ScrumBrawl is the inaugural title for VicTim Games LLC.&#10;&#10;Game time ranges from 20-40 minutes for a 2 player game, 30-45 minutes for a 3 player game, and 40-60 minutes for a 4 player game.&#10;&#10;",

If that wasn't enough to worry about, our neighbors are also preparing for war and petitioning the king for his troops and supplies which are already spread thin. It seems you'll not only be fighting a war of steel, but one of words as well.&#10;&#10;In Dragon Valley, players take turns dividing items such as knights and archers, building materials for blacksmith shops and towers, special powers and even attackers. The attackers consist of dragons, orcs and battering rams that emerge from mountain passes into each player's lands. After dividing, other players select the group of items they prefer and leave the remainder with the player who did the dividing. After that, players use special cards to interfere with each others plans. The last step each round is for players to setup defenses, destroy the attackers or laying siege on the orc strongholds scattered throughout Dragon Valley.&#10;&#10;",

You will also help to construct the Temple, one of the wonders of the ancient world.&#10;&#10;Kingdom of Solomon is a worker-placement game with a few new twists and turns. Do you claim a resource space, an action space or throw in all your remaining pawns to grab a powerful Bonus Space? Will you spend your resources to extend Solomon's kingdom, take some points in the Market or add to the Temple? These and many other choices await you in this highly interactive game.&#10;&#10;You play Kingdom of Solomon in rounds of four phases.  You start the round placing your pawns to get resources, take actions or get a bonus.  In this placement phase players take turns, each placing one pawn at a time.  After all pawns have been placed, players resolve what they get from placing their pawns.  This is called the resolution phase, and each player, in turn, resolves the placement of all their pawns before the next player.  Next the players can go to the Market to sell or buy resources.  In this market phase, like the placement phase, players alternate taking turns, except that players take turns in reverse order.  The last shall be first, and the first shall be last.  Finally, you build in the building phase.  Players, one at a time, can build a building, roads and add blocks to the Temple.&#10;  &#10;When you place pawns to take actions, you can get an additional resource for a resource space, trade one resource for another, steal a resource from an opponent, get victory points or draw Fortune cards.  You can play Fortune cards at any time.  Fortune cards provide resources, victory points or special actions.  Bonuses your pawns can gain for you include one of every resource, three Fortune cards or victory points with a rearrangement of turn order so you become the new first player.&#10;&#10;You use resources to build things.  Each thing costs a specific set of resources.  The buildings you build give you victory points and additional spots to place pawns for resources or actions.  Roads link resource spaces into resource regions so you can get more resources per pawn placed in the resource region.  Building Temple blocks give you either victory points or temple tokens that help you gain or keep the High Priest.  The High Priest lets you take advantage of another player&rsquo;s resource region and gives you victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end the round when a player places all his building tokens on building sites, there is a building token on each of the building sites, or the Temple is complete.

In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;",

Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.&#10;&#10;After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.&#10;&#10;The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.&#10;&#10;Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.&#10;&#10;Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!&#10;&#10;Nightfall's base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.&#10;&#10;The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Nightfall: Martial Law&#10;    Nightfall: Blood Country&#10;    Nightfall: The Coldest War&#10;    Nightfall: Dark Rages&#10;    Nightfall: Eastern Skies&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Low-ranking officers don't yield much fame, but they hold both the purse strings and the power of the sword. A few roosters in the lower offices of Aedile and Praetor, together with the votes of a few well-paid (and temporary) allies, can clear a path to the luxury and recognition that come with the titles of Censor, Consul, and even Caesar.&#10;&#10;Being Caesar isn't easy, though: fail to bribe and bargain to ensure the welfare of the whole coop and today's Caesar is tomorrow's Coq au Vin. Dead roosters don't earn any more points, but they do offer opportunities for their surviving relatives to exaggerate their accomplishments. All that matters, in the end, is history's judgment, and history can be rewritten.&#10;&#10;Mechanically, players gain and maintain areas of influence through negotiation and voting. The game features a Suffragium marker that players pass after voting to either promote a Rooster to a higher office, or throw him to the fox. Players can also strategically demand bribes for their votes or even refuse to vote (pass) to gain a later advantage.&#10;&#10;Murder, betrayal, votes for cash, fragile alliances, and bloody vendettas will separate the legendary families from the forgotten ones in the struggle to become &ndash; and remain &ndash; Chicken Caesar!&#10;&#10;",

The two separate battles shown in this game are named for the main objective city on each map, Mozhaysk to the west of Moscow, and Mtsensk to the south. Perhaps the most dramatic of the many desperate battles fought in front of Moscow, these two battles combined all the elements of the great struggle. The Germans have an excellent fighting machine but are short on fuel and time. They must capture their objectives on a tight schedule or snow and mud will end their offensive. The Soviets are down to the rearward remnants of their once immense armies. If the Soviets can avoid being encircled by the fast moving German forces, high quality reinforcements from the Far East may finally allow them to stop the German advance.&#10;&#10;Historically, the Soviets stood fast at Mozhaysk, fighting heavily even on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino. Like Napoleon, the Germans eventually took the field, but at great cost in time and manpower. Near Mtsensk Guderian&rsquo;s Panzer spearhead advancing north from Orel was ambushed by the Soviets thereby disrupting the German timetable. This gave the Soviet 6th Guards Rifle Division time to dig-in on the heights above Mtsensk thereby barring the way to Tula and Moscow.&#10; Roads to Moscow uses the same mechanics found in the acclaimed Roads to Leningrad game, featuring a chit draw for activation of formations. Both players quickly learn how to use their motorized units effectively for overruns, combined arms, and movement of reserves.

For example, if you land on a red space, you play the red category.  However, there are four kinds of special spaces:  All Play (both teams get a different category, and the first team to name 5 things in their category rolls the die and takes the next turn), Flip Flop (teams alternate giving answers until someone can't think of another), Wild (your team gets their choice of the five categories on the card) and Double Down (you have to pick two of the 5 categories and name five things in both those categories, all in 30 seconds).&#10;&#10;When you reach the big Name 5 space in the center of the board (which you have to do by exact count), you'll have the chance to win the game.

All the Uskok leaders, including you, were invited to Nehaj, the unconquerable Uskok fortress, in order to choose their next Warlord.&#10;&#10;Dark storm clouds loomed over the stone fortress, its walls battered by the bitter nothern gales, and yet the Uskok leaders could not come to an agreement. Mighty warriors though they were, none of them had proved to be enough to their comrades, so no Warlord had been chosen. As midnight struck, the debate was cut short by a shot from a flintlock. The hall went silent. The old sea dog Stipe spoke: &quot;According to ancient customs, if no agreement is reached by midnight, the title of Warlord shall go to the first lord who collects enough loot to fill twenty-five Uskok vessels.&quot; So it was written, and so it was done.&#10;&#10;Uskoci were a historical pirate band in the 16th century who lived and prospered by being a nuisance for much more powerful opponents, but never on such a scale to provoke full-scale retaliation. Uskoci: The card game of Croatian pirates takes that idea of heart as players need to demonstrate both their skill as a pirate and restraint comparable to the historical Uskoci to prove the best captain among your peers.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, players must combine treasures (valued 1-9) on their pile until they total exactly 25; what makes this difficult are the 14 event cards (Venetians, traitors, storms) that can mess with a player's plans or change the value of a treasure, but thankfully they can also protect you. The more complex game adds card drafting to the mix, with the player who has the least treasure on the table drafting the most cards.&#10;&#10;The rules in both games are for 3-6 players, with modifications that allow two players to go head-to-head.&#10;&#10;",

You would think so, given that the weapons are hidden within your fortress, but ninja are sometimes so sneaky that they forget where they hid things. Start looking, ninja!&#10;&#10;In Ninjago: The Board Game, a spin-off of the 2011 line of Ninjago spin-and-attack figures from LEGO, players must work together to claim the weapons and fight back the skeleton guards you'll encounter. On a turn, you spin the die, then take one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; On a two, you move your ninja up to two spaces, searching a guardhouse for a weapon if you stop in a space where a guardhouse is located.&#10;&bull; On a one/guard, move one space, then place a skeleton guard on a space occupied by a ninja.&#10;&bull; On a one/general, move one space, then move the skeleton general one space down the temple steps.&#10;&bull; On a rope/general, attach a rope to your ninja's head (!) and a nearby guardhouse, then swing to any space that you can reach and land there, then move the general down the temple steps one space.&#10;&#10;If a skeleton guard is in your space at the start of your turn, spin the spinner. If it lands on your color or the color of any other ninja in that space, you defeat the guard and take a normal turn; otherwise, move the general down one step and lose your turn.&#10;&#10;If the general reaches the bottom of the steps, he steal one weapon from you, then climbs to the top of the steps once again to begin another descent. If you have claimed no weapons by the time this happens, you all lose the game.&#10;&#10;Once all the weapons are claimed or captured by the general, enter the final battle, taking turns with the spinner to see whether the general captures another weapon, whether the ninja do, or whether nothing happens. Your sensei awaits on the side of the board, ready to aide you once during this final battle to protect the weapons &ndash; unless you've already used his power during the game.&#10;&#10;As with all the LEGO games, Ninjago: The Board Game includes multiple variants, such as adjusting the power of the sensei, adding a memory component, adding or removing steps in the temple to tweak the general's effect.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player rolls all six dice, then sets aside any dice that have a value equal to or less than the similarly-colored die on the target card. For example, if the card has a blue die showing a 4, then any value from 1 to 4 on the blue die would be valid and set aside. The player can stop and score points equal to the sum of his valid dice or roll the invalid dice. If he rolls at least one valid die, he sets that aside and can choose to stop or roll again; if he rolls no valid dice, then he scores points equal to all the dice on the target card for which no die was set aside. Set aside five dice, and you score an extra five points; set aside all six, and your score for the round is doubled. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Fiese 15 includes 15 target cards, with only ten being used each game. The target cards are double-sided, with only five dice showing on the opposite side, allowing players to choose a variant that handicaps the leaders with tougher targets.&#10;&#10;",

That neighbor can either fess up &ndash; in which case he scores all the people cards in play &ndash; or he can deny the charge, in which case the active player randomly draws a card from his hand and lays it on the table in front of the neighbor, revealing some of the smell that others have detected.&#10;&#10;If you make it once around the table without anyone confessing, add another person card to the crowd of sniffers, then go around the table again. Repeat this process up to three times, at which point most people will have three cards in front of them. Everyone then simultaneously points to the person who they think created the ruckus (that is, who has the largest total of odor cards), abstaining if they are that person. Everyone then sums their stink, with the &quot;winner&quot; claiming the person cards in play and a card for each person blaming him; anyone who accuses a player incorrectly is penalized. Smallest score after a number of rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Being dealt a hand of high numbers doesn't automatically presage your coronation as a gas god as high numbers typically have a special power that comes into play when someone reveals the card from your hand. The 7, for example, removes all other cards in your hand from play, while the 6 lets you exchange up to three cards from your hand with an opponent. With odor comes power!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Each round of Knock Your Blocks Off takes place in two phases, the first with players building up a structure and the second with players trying to knock the crown off an opponent's building.&#10;&#10;In the first phase &ndash; the Building Phase &ndash; players roll their six colored blocks simultaneously, then race to build one of the five approved structures: a six-block tall tower, a six-block long wall, a 2x3 fort, a 3x2 wall or steps. The blocks are part white, part colored, and on the face visible to the blocks' owner, the colors of adjacent blocks must match. Once a structure is finished, a player caps the structure with his crown block. The first player to complete his building grabs the demolition die from the table and (if he built a wall, fort or steps) receives a victory token.&#10;&#10;In the second phase &ndash; the Destruction Phase &ndash; the player with the die chooses a neighboring player, then rolls the die to see whether he attacks like an Ogre (by tossing the die underhanded at that opponent's building), like a Dragon (by dropping the die straight down on that building), or with a boulder (by placing the die on the table, then flicking it at that building). If the attack dislodges that building's crown, the attacker wins a victory token; if not, the defender wins a victory token. Each type of building provides its owner a special power: Forts are immune to boulders, Towers earn an extra victory token when defended, and so on. The attacked player then attacks someone else until everyone has attacked and been attacked once, then a new round begins.&#10;&#10;As soon as someone claims his eighth victory token, he wins the game. For a more difficult game, or to balance play between adults and children, the minimum distance of an attack can be increased from one foot to two feet.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Phantom Fury - The 2nd Battle for Fallujah&#10;This solitaire game simulates, at tactical scale, the combat waged by US forces during the month of November 2004 to secure the city of Fallujah and crush insurgent resistance. The game particularly focuses on the fighting of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Jolan District in the north-west part of the city in the morning of November 9th.&#10;&#10;The player controls USMC troops while the system handles the insurgents. This design is based mainly on the article &quot;Infantry Squad Tactics: Some of the lessons learned during MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain) in the battle for Fallujah&quot;, published in the September 2005 issue  of the Marine Corps Gazette.&#10;&#10;The map includes a part of the Jolan District, divided into 61 zones of approximately 50x50 meters and sections of road of equal size. Each zone is made-up of several locations (open ground, courtyard, first storey, second storey, rooftop) represented by boxes that are used to manage movement. Tracks and charts are also on the map edges.&#10;&#10;The troops of each side are represented by &lsquo;unit&rsquo; counters, each corresponding to one Marine squad (six to 12 men) or a group of insurgents (about six men each). The total strength of USMC forces is about that of a reinforced company. Each squad has a combat factor that is used to resolve firing and assaults. The attachment of a Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) to a squad increases its combat factor in certain cases. When a USMC squad suffers a step loss during combat, the counter is flipped to its reduced side. If it suffers another loss, the unit is removed from the game (i.e., the squad is no longer operational and the wounded are evacuated to the rear). Insurgent units appear in two distinct types: guerrilla units and martyr units, also each with their own combat factors. Guerrilla units fight USMC troops but withdraw rather than be destroyed. Martyr units, instead, have vowed to die where they stand and kill as many enemies as possible. These units are immobile and, within their fortified positions, await the attacks of USMC forces. At all times, insurgent units are eliminated after suffering one step loss.&#10;&#10;Insurgent units do not appear directly on the map. Initially, the player deploys &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers which represent a potential, non-identified danger to USMC troops. Their placement is partially random. Once fired upon or assaulted, these &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers are activated and their true nature (dummy, guerrilla, martyr, IED, or sniper) is revealed. However, USMC troops can also count on the support and fire power of a pair of M1A2 Abrams tanks. A section of Iraqi soldiers from the Iraqi Intervention Force (IIF) is also available, their mission being the capture of the mosque in Jolan, as the USMC troops do not have the right to enter that zone.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a maximum of 16 turns, each representing about 15 minutes of real time. Each turn begins with a variable cycle of USMC support missions. These missions are of three types (reconnaissance by drones &ndash; UAV, close air support by helicopter, and aerial bombardment). Each of these missions can only be conducted a certain amount of times per game, and their execution is not automatic. In case of a mission being cancelled or delayed, the insurgents can temporarily take the initiative and act (reinforcements, withdrawal, counter-attack, etc.). Then, a reinforcement phase allows the player to enter extra troops onto the map at the cost of victory points. Each squad then has the opportunity to fire or move. After conducting movement, the player resolves his assaults against insurgent units that are adjacent to his Marines. Before launching an assault, a squad can detach its security element in order to isolate the zone and prevent any retreat by the enemy. There are three types of assaults in the game, depending on the locations occupied by the belligerents: &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;, &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;, and normal. Each type has their advantages and disadvantages for the attacker and defender. CAAT support can also use their incendiary explosives to eliminate insurgents that are too strongly entrenched. Also, each assault can be accompanied by a random event which will influence its result. The game turn concludes with a re-organization phase during which the USMC capture of zones and the infiltration by insurgent troops is checked.&#10;&#10;At the end of the 16 turns, the player determines his victory level. If all of the zones on the map are not controlled by the USMC, the player loses the game. If at the end of any turn the USMC controls every zone, the player wins the game and calculates his victory points to determine the extent of his victory (major, minor, bitter). A full game can be completed in about four hours.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&bull; 17x22 map&#10;&#10;&bull; 88 &frac12;&rsquo;&rsquo; die-cut counters and 140 5/8&rsquo;&rsquo; counters&#10;&#10;&bull;  1 player aid&#10;&#10;&bull; 1 die&#10;&#10;&bull; Rule booklet&#10;&#10;",

A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.&#10;&#10;A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame&#10; From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.&#10;&#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.  The non-player insurgents will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&#10;&#10;GMT COIN Series, Volume I&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss presents a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus our new COunterINsurgency series).
