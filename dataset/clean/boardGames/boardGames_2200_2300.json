        "description": "Blitzkrieg is one of Avalon Hill's earlier releases. The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major countries.&#10;&#10;&#10;Blitzkrieg is one of the classic Avalon Hill war games that set up the military simulation board game hobby.&#10;&#10;Blitzkrieg is a board game with printed cardboard square pieces played on a hard mapboard. The mapboard is hard paper stock that is the same as what one would find with a Monopoly playboard. Printed on the mapboard is a map on a hexagonal grid (hex spaces, or simply &quot;hexes&quot;), and terrain for land, beach, cities, rivers, roads, mountain, desert, and borders. There are a few charts, such as the one for the combat results table, and a die for random outcomes.&#10;&#10;The cardboard pieces represent large military units. There are brigades, divisions, squadrons and air wings. The different types of military units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, shock artillery, fighters and bombers. Navel action is allowed but abstracted.&#10;&#10;There are three levels of the game, the basic game (simplest), advanced (all the complicated rules), and tournament (fast play with advance rules). There are optional rules for the advanced game. The basic game only includes the land game, no naval invasions, and is the best starter tool for new gamers. The basic game has a more simplified combat results table. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.&#10;&#10;The nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hexgames. So once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game was not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics, once you learned one game all of the other played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.&#10;&#10;The basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had rating printed in large print on the piece, (or &quot;chits,&quot; as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The &quot;4&quot; is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the &quot;1&quot; in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies&rsquo; 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, the higher the odds will favor that side.&#10;&#10;Also in combat, terrain would impact combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).&#10;&#10;When Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.&#10;&#10;In the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seem to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.&#10;&#10;",

Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.&#10;&#10;European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D. Porter (USN), and Jefferson Davis, to name a few.&#10;&#10;The map depicts central Mexico down to Mexico City, the target of the American player. Players have to deal with supply and a complex set of morale rules. Counters represent basic units, horses, naval units, leaders and a US dummy unit.

The first phase, the drift, involves a player moving a landscape tile of the same type as depicted on the card they play. The tile must be moved further away from the South Pole (the centre of Pangea) than it already is, must remain a part of the same continent and must be attached to a continent with that player's herds.

I'm sleeping on the floor at Anthony's house. He's a Gambler, and he's got the best leftovers in town! And those silk suits he never wears are almost all my size. Tomorrow I should figure out where he keeps the keys to that car he never drives.&#10;&#10;Freeloader is a game celebrating the glorious pastime of living off other people's success. Players spend the game roaming the neighborhood, doing favors for their &quot;friends&quot; in exchange for great loaner stuff like the Doctor's Car, the Artist's clothes, or the Waitress' leftover food. To win the game you have to collect Food, Clothing, and Shelter before the deck runs out. It's all worth points, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Freeloader is the best of what Cheapass Games does: a simple, entertaining board game with decent strategy and a rock-bottom price tag. The game was designed by James Ernest and illustrated by Cheyenne Wright, and it's a total hoot. But hey, don't just take our word for it.&#10;&#10;Borrow it from your friends and play it for yourself.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Awards&#10;&#10;&#10;    2003 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Wargame based around the WW2 Western Allied campaign from just after the Normandy invasion to the crossing of the Rhine.&#10;&#10;First significant mechanic is the unpredictable turn order - players dice for each turn, with the highest taking the turn. However, ties end that month's play (players draw fresh supply points each month, and the game ends after 20 months).&#10;&#10;Second significant mechanic is the use of (limited) supply points to activate stacks of units when it's your turn. Like games such as We the People/Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage/Rommel in the Desert/Napoleon, you don't have the resources to activate all of your units each turn, you need to decide what the current priority is in line with the current situation. Activation generally allows you to either move stacks or attack with stacks, but with an increased expenditure of supply points, you can take more powerful 'breakthrough' turns involving both movement and attack.&#10;&#10;These mechanics (unpredictable turn order, limited ability to activate units each turn) create a game of fluid tactical situations, where your planning has to be flexible - you never know who will get the next turn.&#10;&#10;The Allied player has to break out of the beach head and capture additional supply ports (which raise the number of supply points available to the Allies, and hence the number of activations possible) en route to Germany. The German player must contain the Allies in Normandy for as long as possible before falling back to the Rhine, while also denying the valuable supply ports to the Allies as long as possible. The Allies are up against a tight timetable; the Germans must work against as increasing disadvantage in supply points.&#10;&#10;Victory is generally determined by the difference in numbers between German units West of the Rhine and Allied units East of the Rhine at game end. Allied paratroops, the German Bulge offensive, reinforcements/replacements and strategic movement add to the game. The big mounted map with large hexes and counters remove the 'fiddle factor' which can blight wargames with lower production values.&#10;&#10;Republished in Command Magazine Japan #64 in 2005.&#10;&#10;",

These commodities are traded for credits at the three major planetoid stations. Vicious fights can break out over control of particularly lucrative asteroids.

        "description": "In the all-too-distant future, a bunch of people play a dangerous sport called Fightball, and James Ernest wrote a game about it.&#10;&#10;The setting is the streets of the future &mdash; not the real future, but the crazy apocalyptic future we all know and love. In this particular future, gangs of street thugs have (again) become enamored of the world of modern professional sports. Unfortunately, they have no real idea of how these modern sports were played, besides what they can guess from old photographs and what they know about the sports of their day. If all future sports use multiple balls, surely so did the sports of the twentieth century, right? And even if they didn't, they should have.&#10;&#10;Thus was born Fightball, a weird version of basketball with at least three balls &mdash; maybe more, we're not sure &mdash; two goals, and extremely violent gameplay. The sport is played on the streets and overseen by flying robot referees, and it's played by the weirdest assortment of folks you're likely to see in a game.&#10;&#10;Basically, Fightball is like basketball. Players build a &quot;court&quot; out of 24 cards and play four rounds. The play is fast and furious, with each player playing as fast as he can. When one player reaches the &quot;BUZZ&quot; card (at the bottom of the deck) the round is over. Now, players score each location on the court, looking for a sequence of cards starting with a player, then a ball, then a shot. Other cards, like blockers, can affect the quality of the shot. Some shots succeed, and are worth points. Others fail, and are worth nothing. The highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game!&#10;&#10;Fightball was released as three sets of double decks, and any two decks can be played against one another.&#10;&#10;",

Ship movement is Newtonian and three-dimensional: (X,Y) and (X,Z) position charts are used to track where the ships are at any given time.  Players spend ship points to buy ship components and technology points to buy improved technologies; victory points are earned for destroying pods and ships and for being the last player to have ships in play. When all of one player's ships have been destroyed or warped out, the player with the highest victory point total wins.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are suggested with differing allowed technologies and different numbers of starting ship and technology points. The approximate playing time is a guess; it will depend on the chosen scenario.&#10;&#10;This is Space Capsule #4, the fourth in SPI's series of science fiction microgames.&#10;&#10;Now under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence.&#10;&#10;",

As the Central Powers player YOU control the armies of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and make the difficult strategic decisions the two-front war requires. As the Allied player YOU command the forces of the rest of Europe Including Britain, France, Russia. Italy, Belgium, Rumania, Serbia, and the United States, and carry the burden of forcing back the strongly entrenched enemy corps on both the west and eastern fronts. No other game presents so great a challenge to test each player's grasp of military strategy.&#10; Ten Historical Scenarios From the summer of 1914 through the final surrender on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day and month of 1918, GUNS OF AUGUST spans the entire First World War in monthly Game-Turns; each player maneuvers hundreds of infantry and cavalry corps and their supporting artillery and engineer regiments. And in addition to this mammoth campaign game, separate scenarios for each front during each year of the war, which can be combined into two-front scenarios for 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917, have been specially designed to allow players to vary the size, difficulty, and playing time of their games.&#10;&#10;For those who think that World War I Is an unexciting subject for a game, GUNS OF AUGUST will prove a shock comparable to the appearance of British tanks at Cambrai, and German stosstrupen at Caporetto.&#10;&#10;COMPLEXITY: Rated &quot;5&quot; on a scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (hard) &#10;1040 Counters&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description :)&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's definitive World War I game.  &#10;Comes with 4 mapboard panels showing all of the major theaters of the war to end all wars.
