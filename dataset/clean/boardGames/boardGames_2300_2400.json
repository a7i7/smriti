While the safest course would be withdraw into Virginia, rest the army and seek battle on another day, Robert E. Lee decides to stand and fight at Sharpsburg.&#10;&#10;On the Union side, George B. McClellan is no longer as confident of victory as he was a few days ago, when the discovery of Lee's marching orders gave Little Mac all the information he needed to defeat the enemy in detail.

In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.&#10;&#10;In Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!&#10;&#10;Furthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.&#10;&#10;The really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.&#10;&#10;At the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.&#10;&#10;You aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!&#10;&#10;",

This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.&#10;&#10;Scenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies).

This collection brings together three of the finest, covering three very different aspects of the Roman Empire: Hannibal versus Rome, Imperium and Circus Maximus.&#10;&#10;Hannibal versus Rome is a 30-minute two-player game depicing the initial struggle for supremacy between Rome and Carthage, which finally established Rome as the leading power in the Mediterranean. It draws on the events of the Second Punic War, during which Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants, and defeated Rome in the battle of Cannae. The Roman general Scipio succeeded in moving the fighting away from Italy, into Spain and Africa, where he defeated the Carthaginians at Zama.&#10;&#10;The map covers the Western Mediterranean. Players move Legions and Fleets, deciding conflicts by the use of cards in order to determine who will be the dominant power in the Mediterranean region.&#10;&#10;Imperium (a game for two to five players) focuses on Rome's political and territorial expansion during the Imperial period. Powerful families controlled the individual provinces in order to increase their wealth and power in Rome, until the Roman Empire reached its zenith in size in the year 100 under the Emperor Trajan.&#10;&#10;In each round the two to five players distribute markers onto areas of the Empire, with control of one area being decided each round. The players need to have the right influence at the decisive moment to take control, without neglecting long-term development. It is a game of planning and timing.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus leads us into the heart of Rome itself with its renowned public entertainment for the masses; chariot racing.&#10;&#10;Chariot races were immensely popular in Rome. The Circus Maximus offered room for 200,000 spectators who avidly followed the races, roaring and cheering on their favourites. The courageous charioteers were divided into teams distinguished by different colours. The most successful were worshipped as heroes, but the risks were high and many paid for their fame and daring with their lives.&#10;&#10;Each of two to five players controls a team of three chariots. In a game of pure tactics, players receive five movement cards that they can assign each turn to individual chariots as they wish. The first to bring all three across the finish line wins the game and the laurel wreath.&#10;&#10;Note: the 3 games in this were previously released in Neue Spiele im alten Rom&#10;&#10;",

Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven.&#10;&#10;In the first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future.

There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Odin's Ravens transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Odin deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire. Whoever reaches the end of the world first wins.&#10;&#10;",

Individual players are rated for their ability to throw/catch/run, block, rush the passer, and several other ratings. You are the coach for your team, and choose from a selection of offensive or defensive moves (Inside Run, Short Pass or Blitz, Run No Key as examples) which affect the outcome, and then flip a deck of cards to work out the result. So if I call the right pass defense against your pass, it becomes harder to complete the pass, or a Run defense means your Run gets less yardage. But if I get it wrong, my defense may have no effect or even greatly increase your chances.&#10;&#10;The game rules cover pretty much every eventuality, but with all the modifiers, it can slow down when combinations happen. In particular turnovers or penalties can make it slow. And luck can be a factor. Get it all right and you still lose the ball, or concede the TD.&#10;&#10;The basic game comes with stats cards for every player in every team. Avalon Hill produced several years worth of cards for use with the game, which you could buy separately. And a strong team will overwhelm a weaker team. Strong offense generally pushes past a weak D and there's not a lot you can do except be lucky. But by picking evenly-matched teams, it does require some forethought to work your team to a score. It's best to include the endurance rules, which mean that some players must 'rest' before you can re-direct a play to them. This means cycling players and dealing with injuries makes tricky decisions for you.&#10;&#10;If you love American Football and know the players and enjoy stats, then Statis Pro Football is for you.&#10;&#10;",

To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.&#10;Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to those who could bring them stones.

Now and then, they would ascend to the top of their towers, and, just for the fun of it, would spit out dice in all directions out over the surrounding lands. As a result, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they were known far and wide as the Dicemouths.&#10;&#10;However, one day the rain of fried dice dried up, and the Dicemouths got extremely hungry.  But they remembered all the dice that they&rsquo;d spat out in the older, better, times.  Looking around, they found that many of them had developed into full grown dice trees, covered in fresh ripe fried dice.  But when the dicemouths tried to leave their towers to pick the dice, they found that they&rsquo;d got so fat that they couldn&rsquo;t get out through the doors.  They were trapped in their own towers.&#10;&#10;But just before it was too late, one of the dicemouths, who&rsquo;d saved a few dice in his tower, had a brilliant idea.  He spat out a die, just as they had always done, but this time, as the die shot out from the tower, he kept tight hold of it, and he and his tower were dragged along behind the flying die.  In this way, he managed to reach the dice trees, picked their fruit, and passed them on to all his friends, saving the race of dicemouths.&#10;&#10;Soon, all the dicemouths were able to travel this way.  And they developed a race, held every year, a dice tower race.  And nowadays, every year, the winner of the race is crowned as King of the Dicemouths.&#10;&#10;",

The players' pawns try to move through the remaining open spaces on the tree, ending their movements on a raindrop, &quot;flicking&quot; it off. Thus, it's a race between the accumulating raindrops and the players' collective ability to flick them off with clever movement plays.&#10;&#10;The rules encourage the players to discuss the options openly for each player's turn, and in fact they'll have their hands full defeating the acid rain together. Doing it alone is practically doomed to failure, and will cripple the other players, too.

Early iterations of the game included cards with attached objects, and cards of a variety of sizes and shapes within the same deck and gameplay session. Many cards in later decks have a point value, but this is by no means a requirement.&#10;&#10;Cards generally include hand-drawn pictures.

Card illustrations can represent anything the designer wants to feature, from serious to absurd. (However, usually cards tend toward the latter.)&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;Game play conventionally follows a &quot;draw one, play one&quot; rule, with standard rotation; however, this, as with any game parameters, can be arbitrarily altered in play.&#10;&#10;In one variant, blank cards are simply made available to all players at all times, and can be created without limitation and played in turn. In other variants, players seed an otherwise blank deck with their own invented cards, which are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. In this latter variant, a player may only craft a new card if he or she draws one of the blank cards during the course of play.&#10;&#10;In most cases, unless countermanded or constrained by rules created during gameplay, players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. Card rules and actions may counter other cards which have already been played.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck is exhausted. Points may be tabulated and a winner declared. In some variants, players may then lay out all of the cards face-up for the &quot;epilogue&quot;, which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game.

Players assume the role of the doomed astronauts searching for equipment and struggling to escape the doomed space station.  They must make their way through a randomly assembled map of the International Space Station while fighting off attacks of other players who are trying to escape themselves.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sucking Vacuum 2nd Edition (titled Ultimate Sucking Vacuum) is an updated version of the Origins Award-nominated game.  Now in full color with a sturdy box, the game features new artwork on the 18 map tiles and 73 die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to the original, but the rules have been re-written and revised in a number of areas.  Additionally, the game now includes Tournament Rules and the Alien Incursion variant which has been extremely popular at conventions.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.alien-menace.info/sucking.htm&#10;&#10;",

The first player to get one of their rabbits to the other side wins.&#10;&#10;This may sound like a simple kids' game, and while it is easy enough for your kids to learn and enjoy, you will find that it is also a very deep game that can take a lifetime to master. Arimaa is one of the deepest strategy games ever invented in the history of mankind, but designed to look intuitively simple. No two games of Arimaa are ever the same. There is much to learn and discover about this intuitively simple, yet intellectually challenging, game.&#10;&#10;Played on an 8x8 grid with four trap squares and 32 animal pieces (16 gold and 16 silver). Each player has an elephant, a camel, 2 horses, 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 8 rabbits.&#10;Strength hierarchy: Elephant &gt; Camel &gt; Horse &gt; Dog &gt; Cat &gt; Rabbit.&#10;&#10;The game begins with an empty board. Gold places the sixteen gold pieces first in any configuration on the first and second ranks. Silver then places the sixteen silver pieces in any configuration on seventh and eighth ranks. Then gold moves its pieces first. A player can move up to four &quot;steps&quot; each turn. All pieces move orthogonally.&#10;&#10;History:&#10;Arimaa was invented by Omar Syed, an Indian-American computer engineer trained in artificial intelligence. Syed was inspired by Garry Kasparov's defeat at the hands of the chess computer Deep Blue to design a new game that could be played with a standard chess set, would be difficult for computers to play well, but would have rules simple enough for his then four-year-old son Aamir to understand. (&quot;Arimaa&quot; is &quot;Aamir&quot; spelled backwards plus an initial &quot;a&quot;).&#10;In 2002, Syed published the rules to Arimaa and announced a $10,000 prize, available annually until 2020, for the first computer program (running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware) able to defeat each of three top-ranked human players in a three-game series.&#10;&#10;",

This led to the formation of the first villages.&#10;&#10;In Clans each player is trying to achieve victory by scoring as many points for their color as they can. This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each region of the board contains five areas, each one of five different types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving , if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty ones, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends and each scoring will either gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type it occured in and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.&#10;&#10;Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, players reveal their colors, and find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is for the players to work together to get the three animals to the safety of the tree.&#10;&#10;All the animals move based on random dice rolls.  Two singular colored pips are possible, green and black, and are evenly distributed on the two dice.  A black pip moves Max one space, while green pips can be distributed by player consensus (teaches logic, consultation and decision making) among the other animals to move them.  Obviously Max has a better chance to move, more often and further than the others creatures who share the green pip rolls.  On the other hand Max can only move forward, as well the players can opt to move their animals before or after Max.  The players also have the option of using four cat treats to call Max back to the starting position, allowing the other animals to escape possible capture or lengthen their lead.&#10;&#10;Each animal has their own special short cut on the game board to speed their journey or dart from Max.  Unfortunately the short cuts could be missed by over-shooting the short-cut entrance.  However if Max lands on any short-cut entrance, he must take it on his next turn.  In fact Max can end up between or even ahead of the other animals as they advance down the path together.  When Max reaches the base of the tree, he camps out and waits for the animals behind him, who will have to risk a final leap on and off Max's back to get to safety.  The players all win or lose depending on how successful they are at saving the bird, mouse and chipmunk from Max.&#10;&#10;",

It included 20 players on each at-that-time current (1970 season) baseball team, presented on tri-fold color charts.  The following two years, they released new editions to cover the most recent season.  For 1972, they switched to teams of 25 players each, on double-sided color charts without folds.  In 1973, The game title was changed to Pennant Race and the team roster size was reduced to 19 or 20 players per team. The team charts were replaced by individual player cards on perforated sheets, with no color coding.&#10;&#10;Also in 1972, Time released a set of 16 All-Time All-Star Team Charts (in the same style as that year's edition), for each of the original American League and National League franchises, each with the 25 &quot;best&quot; players from that team's long history. In 1973, the same All-Time charts were released in a separate All-Time All-Star Baseball game.  This product was popular among tabletop managers.&#10;&#10;The All-Time All-Star game was then changed to an individual card format and retitled as Superstar Baseball.  This was later transferred to Avalon Hill when they picked up the entire line of sports games from Time.  This also granted Avalon Hill the right to use the words &quot;A Sports Illustrated Game&quot; on any Avalon Hill sports product, even if it wasn't part of the original Time, Inc line of games, which led to some confusion for titles such as Baseball Strategy, Football Strategy, and Pro Golf.&#10;&#10;Special dice with results ranging from 10 through 39 (often called 10-39 Dice, see How to make a set of SIBB dice -- A Tutorial) were required to play this game, and sister games in the original Sports Illustrated sports simulation line.&#10;&#10;",

Later the game came out in a traditional-size box.  A second edition with clarified rules was issued in 1974 with the same standard size box but thinner.&#10;&#10;The rules are fairly straightforward.  The strategies are extremely deep. Stalingrad is by far the most thoroughly and deeply analyzed board war game.  Furthermore, the game preserves interest for players at a wide range of levels. Stalingrad is a good game to use to introduce players to hex-based war games.&#10;&#10;Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one square) or retreat (two squares) after combat.  Units have one-square thick zones of control; movement directly from one square in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining square of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one square per turn movement), mountains (one square per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten square movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns, but I have never heard of this being done between normal players.&#10;&#10;Several extremely bad German strategic plans are in wide use.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2&#10;&#10;",
