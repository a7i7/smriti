Using tried and true mechanics but with some major twists, Tide at Sunrise will be a major test of player skill that is rarely seen in the wargaming hobby. Here, the base system is little more than the tried and true game from SPI called Napoleon at Waterloo. But not all is at it seems.&#10;&#10;Here is the sequence of play:&#10;&#10;Japanese Player Turn&#10;&#10;* Naval Phase&#10;    * Transport Allocation&#10;    * Movement Phase&#10;    * Combat Phase&#10;    * Replacement and Recovery&#10;&#10;Russian Player Turn&#10;&#10;* Colonel Akashi Secret Operations Phase&#10;    * Transport Allocation Phase&#10;    * Movement Phase&#10;    * Combat Phase&#10;    * Supply and Recovery Phase&#10;&#10;After the completion of both Player Turns, victory points are determined and, if the Japanese have not won a sudden death win, play continues to the next turn.&#10;&#10;The game focuses on two aspects of the actual event. Players have to manage their armies using an abstract logistical system called &ldquo;Transport Points&rdquo; in the game. The Japanese Transport Points are an abstraction of the merchant marine force that the Japanese had available in 1904 and 1905. This can be disrupted from Russian naval activity. The Russian Transport Points are an abstraction of the rail capacity of the newly built Trans-Siberian Railroad. Weather can affect this total if there are heavy snows in Siberia. Colonel Akashi can also stir up trouble and reduce the available Russian Transport totals with sudden strikes and riots in the Russian heartland. Both players use these points to bring on new forces and to replace battlefield losses. Finding the right balance of the two uses is key to being successful in the game.&#10;&#10;Secondly, players must find the delicate balance between defending and attacking on two separate fronts. How much defends and attacks towards the all-important port of Port Arthur and how much attacks or holds the tough mountain passes of Manchuria - the key to the open plains to the north &ndash; where terrain is less defensible and victory points are everywhere.&#10;&#10;Victory in the game is determined by success in the naval war, the capture of key terrain objectives and enemy losses.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&#10;* One 22&rdquo; by 39&rdquo; full color map&#10;    * 140 1/2&rdquo; land formation counters&#10;    * 44 1 1/4&rdquo; by 5/8&rdquo; ship counters&#10;    * 16 page full color rulebook&#10;&#10;Game summary:&#10;&#10;* Playtime: 3-5 hours&#10;    * Complexity: Simple&#10;    * Solitaire rating: excellent&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;&#10;* Turns: 12 (each turn represents one month of real time)&#10;    * Counters: Divisions and Brigades for the land units, Capital Ships for the naval units&#10;    * Hex scale: 10 kilometers&#10;&#10;Game Credits:&#10;&#10;* Designer: Yukihiro Kuroda&#10;    * Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;    * Graphic Artist: Niko Eskubi&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The second Master Set for the HeroScape series of games.&#10;&#10;Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles. Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn. Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage - unless you are falling into water.&#10;&#10;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card under attack, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the defense number on their unit's card. Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds. When the number of wounds equals the unit's life value, it is killed and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;For years the Marro have been summoned to Valhalla to expand the will of Utgar at all costs. But rumors are spreading that within the uncharted jungle there is an even greater menace waiting. A great Marro Hive, hidden deep within in the jungle swamps and treacherous rock is continuously spawning new savage predators. These creatures, said to be venomous Marro, perhaps even Hivelords, will emerge from their colony and contaminate the world. Includes 24 detailed miniature figures and 75 interlocking terrain pieces.&#10;&#10;This new Master Set includes everything you need to start your own adventures in the Heroscape world of Valhalla! There are 2 new Terrain Types: Swamp &amp; Swamp Water, as well as more Grass, Sand, Rock, and Water tiles to add to your existing Heroscape battlefields.&#10;&#10;Also included in the set are 7 Unique Heroes, and 3 Common Marro Squads. However, the big news is the inclusion of the Marro Hive. The Hive has special powers directly relating to Common Marro Squad figures.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Summary: This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure).  The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&#10;&#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &quot;colleagues&quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &quot;good old days,&quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &quot;holds&quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &quot;captain,&quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &quot;day&quot; and which to the &quot;night.&quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &quot;day&quot; - and one on the right (&quot;night&quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &quot;combat&quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &quot;gunpowder&quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&#10;&#10;",

Players are part of a covert team (red, blue, green) that must eliminate one member of an opposing team, but your target is a mystery. At the start of the round, players are randomly dealt a card that depicts one of four characters: sniper, agent, cleaner, mole. The sniper of one team must shoot the sniper of another team to win that round. Problem is, you have to figure out who to shoot without being shot yourself.&#10;&#10;As for the other characters, the mole is secretly working for one of the other teams, the agent makes the other team lose if he is shot, and the cleaner must make the shot if the sniper isn&rsquo;t a part of the team. (Two cards are randomly thrown out each round, so a team&rsquo;s sniper might be out of play. The cleaner needs to figure this out by talking with his teammates, but since all discussion is open, they still need to be covert in their talk.) Members of the winning team (or teams, when three teams are in play) receive a score card, and the first player (or players) to receive four cards wins the game. Teams are randomly determined each round, so your back-up man one round may be your target the next. Covert Action sounds utterly simple, yet is difficult to describe succinctly. I look forward to seeing how Frank makes everything clear in the rules.&#10;&#10;",

Each card belongs to a continent, with some continents having only a single card and some having up to four cards.&#10;&#10;A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show artillery, cavalry, general, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.&#10;&#10;Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional general line in the process. If a player owns all the cards of one continent, however, those cards are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these cards are now worth more points because you've united the continent under one ruler (you).&#10;&#10;When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

CC:P's main theme is the addition of three new factions to the Combat Commander family:&#10;&#10;    Imperial Japan&#10;    the Pacific US - with a strong emphasis on the US Marine Corps&#10;    the Pacific Commonwealth - focusing on Indian and ANZAC forces&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CC:P is a stand alone game in the card-driven Combat Commander game series. While utilizing Combat Commander: Europe's basic rules, CC:P includes numerous rule tweaks and additions in order to more accurately portray tactical warfare as experienced by the participants in and around the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This slightly ramps up the complexity of the Combat Commander series while at the same time imparting a bit more depth and realism. Just a few of the additions include:&#10;&#10;Banzai attacks;&#10;BARs and Thompson SMGs;&#10;Beach landings &amp; river crossings;&#10;Hidden movement;&#10;Caves;&#10;Scouts;&#10;Aircraft;&#10;Bayonets;&#10;Mortar spotting;&#10;Treetop snipers;&#10;Reconnoitering.&#10;&#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet across (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Turn abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete Game Turn abstractly represents several minutes of real time.&#10;&#10;UNITS: Due in part to the unique composition of late-war USMC squads and the imbedding of specialized weapon teams within IJA squads, the units in the game are represented by 4-6 man Teams and 8-13 man Squads. Radios &mdash; and individual weapons larger than a rifle &mdash; are represented by their own counters. Individual Aircraft are also represented with their own counters.&#10;&#10;VICTORY: Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific Objective chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.&#10;&#10;GAME FLOW: A game of Combat Commander is divided into several Time segments. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; and die roll &quot;Triggers&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.&#10;&#10;CC:P includes twelve maps featuring terrain specific to the PTO.&#10;&#10;CC:P's playbook includes:&#10;&#10;    twelve scenarios.&#10;    Pacific version of the Random Scenario Generator utilizing the new maps and nationalities.

After the inital set-up, the players draw their two hand cards, and have to fulfill the tasks on these (either to occupy as many spaces in a certain area as possible or as many places with a certain spice scattered all over the island).&#10;&#10;The merchants have different characteristics. For example, smaller ones are faster but the larger ones are stronger, so they can displace them. Points are gained by fulfilling tasks. The better you fulfill the task, the more points you get. But you also have to decide, wether to reject a task or score quickly, even if you get negative score, just to get a better task and force the game to its end. Each player must also reject one or two tasks (depending on the number of players) during the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has fulfilled 9 (or 8 with 4 or 5 players) of his tasks. The player with most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Brass: Lancashire &mdash; first published as Brass &mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Build an industry tile&#10;    Build a rail or canal&#10;    Develop an industry&#10;    Sell cotton&#10;    Take a loan&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.&#10;&#10;After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.&#10;&#10;The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).&#10;&#10;Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been removed.&#10;     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck slightly to ensure a consistent experience.&#10;     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.&#10;     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A player is Garibaldi in hiding, the others are the Austrian patrols hunting him. Garibaldi wins if he succeeds in reaching the safe point and can run away, otherwise the Austrian patrols win if they catch Garibaldi.&#10;&#10;In turns, using the cards, it's possible to move on the gameboard, a big-sized board that reproduces accurately a map of the territory at that time. The player who controls Garibaldi, with the help of a special screen, makes his moves secretly, while the other players have to work together to stop the moves of the escaper, trying to find him.&#10;&#10;Garibaldi: La Trafila is a game of deduction and bluff, recommended for all families: the rules are simple, but the gameplay stimulates reasoning and cooperation, offering the possibility for expert players to adopt more refined strategies.&#10;&#10;",

Each time a Persian Unit dies, the Spartans score Glory Points on the Glory Track that surrounds the board. Spartan Units die permanently, while most defeated Persian Units can enter the game again as reinforcements.&#10;&#10;The Object of the Game for the Spartans is to score 100 Glory (or 50 Glory if there are 2 Spartan players). The Object of the Game for the Persians is to wipe out the Spartans before they can achieve their Glory, or to delay the Spartans long enough for Ephialtes to reach the end of the Goat Path (6 rounds of play). If there are 2 Persian Players, then the player with the most Spartan kills wins this game.&#10;&#10;The game uses cards and dice to simulate the action from the film. Spartan Heroes include Leonidas, Stelios, the Captain, Dilios, and Astinos. Persian Leaders include Xerxes, the Uber Immortal, and the Persian Generals. Each card simulates the action associated with a quote from the film, such as &quot;I Would Gladly Kill My Own Men For Victory&quot; (Persian) and &quot;Tonight We Dine In Hell!&quot; (Spartan).&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly (20 - 30 minutes), and is meant to be a fast diversion with a good share of both tactics and luck.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to win the most battles in any given round to become Captain for the next round. But be careful &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t win ANY battles in a round, you&rsquo;re out of the game. You&rsquo;re dealt fewer cards in each successive round, and the player who wins the final round wins the game! Play is fast and furious, with an average game time of only 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;Walk the Plank comes with a deck of 68 cards. The deck has sixty-five numbered cards, two Walk the Plank! cards, and one Sea Monster! card. The sixty-five numbered cards are divided into five suits: Doubloons, Hookhands, Monkeys, Parrots, and Peglegs. The cards in each suit are numbered 1 through 13, with 1 worth the least and 13 worth the most.&#10;&#10;The first dealer, or Captain, deals 7 cards to each player in the first round of seven. Subsequent rounds deal one less card. (Round 2 is 6 cards, Round 3 is 5 cards, etc.) The Captain then turns over the top card on the deck so that everyone may see it. The suit of the card revealed will be trump for the first round. The trump suit is the most powerful suit in any given battle. For example, if Monkeys are trump, then a low card in Monkeys will beat even a higher-numbered card in any other suit. If the card the Captain turns over is a Walk the Plank! or a Sea Monster!, there is no trump suit for this first round. In every round after the first, whoever is Captain chooses the trump suit after looking at his or her cards.&#10;&#10;The suit of the first card played in a battle is called the current suit. If this card is a numbered card, it may or may not be from the trump suit. If the first card played in a battle is one of the three special cards, there is no current suit for that battle, but each player still has to play one card.&#10;&#10;You must play a card of the same suit as the first card played in each battle, if you can. We call this following suit. So if you have any cards in your hand of the same suit as the first one played in a battle, you have to pick one and play it. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have no cards in the current suit. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have a special card (Walk the Plank! or Sea Monster!), unless you choose not to play the special card.&#10;&#10;Walk the Plank! will win any battle, beating even the highest card in the trump suit&mdash;think of it as a &ldquo;wild card&rdquo; worth one more than the highest card in play. When someone plays Sea Monster!, no one wins the battle, no matter what cards&#10;have been played. The player who played Sea Monster! doesn't win the battle, but he/she does gain control. (So he/she gets to choose the current suit for the next battle by playing the first card.)&#10;&#10;The player who wins the battle in the round becomes the Captain in the next round, which means you get to play the first card in the next battle.&#10;&#10;If you win one or more battles in a round in which no other player wins a battle, you win the game!&#10;&#10;",
