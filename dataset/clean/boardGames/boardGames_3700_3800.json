        "description": "The first boardgame by SPI (or anyone else) on history's largest land battle.&#10;&#10;The stark two-color map extends 440 miles from north to south at about 9 miles per hex. Games last 6 turns. The time scale, though not stated, is probably two days per turn. (The historical battle ran 12 days.) Units are German divisions (blue) and ahistorical Soviet &quot;corps&quot; (brown), plus a handful of smaller formations. They have combat and movement factors (e. g., 6-8 for the best German panzer divisions, 2-4 for a Soviet infantry &quot;corps&quot;). The Germans have several non-divisional panzer units that must be stacked with a German division in order to use their combat factor.  The Soviets have artillery and anti-tank brigades that can only use their combat factor in attack or defense, respectively.&#10;&#10;Four bands of fortified lines dominate the map, one German line and three Soviet lines. The Soviet fortified lines are indicated as they existed in May, June and July 1943.  All four lines are used during the historical scenario but not all of the Soviet lines apply to some of the hypothetical scenarios.&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are &quot;semi-active&quot; (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave). The stacking limit is three divisions or &quot;corps&quot;, plus one smaller formation, per hex. The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Supply lines must be traced over no more than 10 hexes to a rail line leading off a friendly map edge, with lack of supply halving movement and combat factors.&#10;&#10;Air power is represented semi-abstractly by air units that can fly close support, interdiction, combat air patrol, air superiority or interception missions. There are no command rules, but a couple of optional rules try to suggest organizational differences between the two armies. These options are quite advantageous to the Germans, who, as in reality, need all the help they can get. One of these optional rules is the ability of the German mechanized divisions to not be completely removed from play on an Eliminate result, but be replaced by low-strength Kampfgrupen (this became a standard rule in later games).&#10;&#10;The game includes six scenarios: historical and free setup scenarios for the historical July start date, hypothetical May and June German attacks, and two hypothetical August Soviet counteroffensives (one with a fixed and the other with a free setup). 255 counters&#10;&#10;For its day, Kursk: Operation Zitadelle was a &quot;monster game&quot; and more attentive to history than many of its rivals. SPI used the same basic system, generally with elaborations, in later World War II games, such as Breakout & Pursuit, The Moscow Campaign and Destruction of Army Group Center.&#10;&#10;",

The games adhere closely to the highly successful BAR rules system. The major change lies in the halving of the strength point ratio so that 1 point equals 50 men, 25 horsemen, or 1 cannon, accommodating the smaller battles and units of North America. There is a noted lack of cavalry in both battles. The counters are in the same style as the other BAR games, but with some interesting variations (e.g., rifle frocks). Brandywine (three maps) has 4 scenarios: Knyphausen's attack at Chads Ford, Cornwallis' attack at Birmingham Meeting House (both one mappers), Howe's historical plan (comprising both Knyphausen's and Cornwallis' attacks), and an optional Howe plan. The latter scenario will allow the British player to select alternative schemes of maneuver to attack the Americans.  Washington, in turn, has the ability to gain intelligence on the British movements      (both true and false information) and possibly readjust his force. Germantown (two maps) has 2 scenarios. They vary based on whether or not the Americans are required to seize the Chew House.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways. The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.&#10;&#10;There are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.&#10;&#10;The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players &lt; 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.&#10;&#10;A battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.&#10;&#10;Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.&#10;&#10;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).&#10;&#10;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;The basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.&#10;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.&#10;&#10;HeroScape: Rise of the Valkyrie is the original master set for the HeroScape series of games.&#10;&#10;",

But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.&#10;&#10;In mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.&#10;&#10;In August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.&#10;&#10;The battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&middot; 22 x 34 inch map sheet (19mm hexes - double sided)&#10;&middot; 3 sheets of 5/8&quot; counters&#10;&middot; Rules book, Play Book, set-up cards, and player aid cards&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE  12 hours per turn  &#10;MAP SCALE  1.2 miles per hex   &#10;UNIT SCALE  Battalions and Companies&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS Vance von Borries&#10;DEVELOPER Tony Curtis&#10;MAP &amp; COUNTER ART Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)Roads to Leningrad is a package consisting of two separate operational level games on WW II --the Battle of Soltsy and the Battle of Staraya Russa.&#10;&#10;Scenarios: &#10;1. The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein&rsquo;s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.&#10;&#10;2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.&#10;&#10;3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?&#10;&#10;4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops. The Soviet player knows he is about to be trapped but maybe one more push would break the German infantry to the north.&#10;&#10;",

The game focuses on cavalry and archery action, featuring mounted archers of exceptional skill. Devil's Horsemen depicts the four major battles of the era - The Indus, The Kalka, Liegnitz and Ayn Jalut.&#10;&#10;Devil's Horsemen features basic rules for both regular and SimpleGBoH play. The rules bring the system into full flower of mounted archery, with a detailed, augmented set of archery and cavalry mechanics that include various types of Shower Fire (as opposed to plain Volley Fire), Impetuosity and Aggression, Feigned Retreat, Harass and Disperse tactics, and Rally to Standards, with the various armies and units being rated for their ability to use these.&#10;&#10;Devil's Horsemen presens a truly colorful array of armies for you to lead into battle: there are 10 full tumen (divisions) of Mongols, plus Polovtsians, Galicians, Chernigovians, Kievans, Persian Khwarazmians, Poles, Silesians, Bohemians, the great Teutonic Knights, and the first army to ever significantly defeat the Mongols, The Mamluks.&#10;&#10;These mighty armies show up in four great battles of the period (ranging from battles needing 1/2 mapsheet to two full-mapsheets).&#10;&#10;The Indus (Genghis Khan vs. Shah Jalal ad-Din and the Khwarazmian Persians, 1221).

Excerpt from rules by game author: 'Often there are only three or four players who want to play 18xx. Or sometimes after a long day of 18xx only few players remain, who want to play another short 18xx-game. &#10;Although there are a large number of 18xx-games already, there are only few 18xx-games for three players. &#10;Therefore I decided to develop this game. I chose Namibia because my little sister lived there several years and sent me a lot of information and historical maps. &#10;The main theme of this game is not complex railroad construction. The number of brown tiles is limited, so that there will be no useless delay in the end of the game (when everything has been decided). Many hexes of the plan probably won't be used, but this is realistic in view of the Namibian geography.'&#10;&#10;",

Most will be creatures of one of the game's 6 types (Barbarians, Goblins, Elves, Trolls, Dwarves, Undead). A lucky player may also get Wizards (which protect creatures of one type from attack) or Catapults (one-use weapons that have a 50/50 chance of destroying a target card). Creatures come in three varieties (infantry, archers, cavalry).&#10;&#10;Armies are placed face-up in front of the players, and three rounds of warfare ensue. At the start of each round, players receive additional cards, including the vital Attack Cards, without which an army can only stand on the defensive. Attack cards are of two types. One (&quot;Battle&quot;) allows all of a player's creatures of one type to attack creatures of either the same type or the type that the attacker most dislikes. Elves, for instance, may attack an opponent's Elves or his Trolls (the Elves' &quot;natural enemy&quot;.) The other type of Attack Card (&quot;Mercenary Army&quot;) allows creatures of different types to combine in an attack against creatures of any one type, but limits the number of attackers. Attack Cards also provide various bonuses to the attacker.&#10;&#10;The resolution of attacks is modeled on Risk. The attacker rolls up to three dice, the defender up to two (the number depending on how many infantry each side has in the battle). The side with more archers, if either, adds one to its high die roll. The highest and second highest rolls for each side are compared, and the low roller in each loses a card (with the defender winning ties). The attack continues until one side is wiped out or the attacker voluntarily breaks off. Attackers with surviving cavalry can then make further attacks.&#10;&#10;Players gain victory points for enemy units destroyed and for having the most creatures of a particular type at the end of the third round of play.&#10;&#10;",

Soult's Army of the Pyrenees, outnumbered and outclassed by Wellington's veteran forces, fell back towards the east, defending a series of river lines. Wellington's troops, showing excellent coordination between their maneuvering wings, were able to turn Soult out of these strong defensive positions one by one, all the while driving toward the inland city of Toulouse.&#10;&#10;On February 26, Wellington's lead elements were able to exploit a gap in the French cavalry screen and began crossing the Gave de Pau River unopposed, moving in the direction of Orthez. Soult chose not to fall back, and arrayed his six divisions in excellent defensive positions on the high ground north and west of the town. On February 27, he would be attacked by Wellington's eight divisions.&#10;&#10;Orthez focuses on the infantry game, and as such serves as an excellent introduction to the system. Artillery plays a supporting role, and there are only a half dozen or so cavalry regiments per side. For the first time we see Wellington and the British on the attack. Command control plays a critical role, and highlights the differences between Wellington's veteran and well-established command hierarchy and Soult's more makeshift organization. British advantages include numerical superiority, command flexibility and their excellent infantry. The main French advantage is the terrific defensive terrain and the defense of interior lines. Make no mistake though, this is a very tough battle for the French.&#10;&#10;In addition to the main battle scenario, there are several smaller scenarios that can be played to conclusion in a long evening. A variety of optional rules are included to provide replayability and variability for face to face or solitaire play.&#10;&#10;La Bataille D'Orthez will feature two hand drawn maps of the battlefield by Rick Barber, as well as 420 state of the art counters and the usual assortment of charts and tables.

The Prussian and Russian armies attempt to ambush the French main army strung out in road march. Their approach goes undetected and they are able to close within two miles. In fact, not until the moment of their assault do the French become aware of them. But, instead of the expected weak flank guard, they are met by the strong divisions of Souham and Girard and by mid-afternoon, Napoleon and 100,000 French and their allies have swarmed to their support. The battle raged in ever-mounting fury until night finally brought an end to the slaughter. The first major battle of the 1813 campaign ends with thousands of dead and wounded and with the Russian and Prussian armies in full retreat.&#10;&#10;La Bataille de Lutzen simulates the first major clash of Napoleons 1813 campaign. Lacking adequate cavalry and handicapped by a large number of raw recruits, the French player must rapidly consolidate his scattered forces to counter the sudden Allied attack.

Each turn, the player lays two tiles and then draws replacements from the bag. Tiles are double-sided (where each side is the mirror image of the other), so tiles can be flipped as well as rotated. &#10;The idea of the game is to score points by completing snakes. The longer the snake, the more points you score (and you can score double points by completing two snakes with one move). Because any tiles played must match existing tiles on the table, it is possible to block opponent's plays as well as setting oneself up for a big score. There is a constant anxiety over whether to complete a snake to secure the points, or extend it in the hope of landing a bigger score later on.&#10;&#10;",

Axis units mostly represent army corps. These include German, Finnish, Italian, Hungarian, Spanish and Romanian units. German tank units provide the real striking power for the Axis, and these are the strongest units in the game. The German infantry is also numerous and strong. The other Axis units are not usually as powerful as the German ones, though the Hungarian unit is good and there is a Romanian cavalry corps.&#10;&#10;Soviet units are generally armies. Some of these are able to stand up to the Germans, but most cannot; while the Soviets start out with a very powerful army the first Axis turn is rough on the Red Army.  The Soviet player must place his or her forces carefully and choose the time and place for counter-attacks. The Soviet player does have the aid of fleets in both the Baltic and the Black Seas, allowing landings behind enemy lines and sometimes support in combat. The Red Army of Workers and Peasants has many tank units, but they are not as strong as the German panzers. It can counter with paratroopers and shock troops, special units not available to the Axis.&#10;&#10;The original game was published in 2004.

        "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Empire of the Sun (EotS) is Mark Herman's third card driven design since he introduced the system to the hobby in We The People. EotS is a strategic level look at the entire War in the Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan. EotS is the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a CDG. Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz, and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia. This is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict.&#10;&#10;As in other games using the CDG system, players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent. The player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices. The focus of EotS is on directing major offensive axes of advance. The Japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as Allied forces battle the clock to react with their in-place forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hard-to-replace Japanese veteran units.&#10;&#10;Combat in EotS is based on successfully bringing superior combined land, air, and sea forces to bear in a two-tiered combat system. The first tier is the resolution of air-naval combat, the second tier covers ground combat. The culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle.&#10;&#10;The key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of U.S. political will. The Japanese win the game by forcing the U.S. into a negotiated peace, which was not achieved historically. The Japanese achieve this by knocking countries like India, China, and Australia out of the war, while inflicting massive casualties on the United States. The delivery of the A-bomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee, often necessitating Operation Olympic and the invasion of Japan. It is often in its darkest hour that the Japanese find victory in EotS.&#10;EotS scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast, grognard, and competitive tournament player in mind. EotS was designed to be played n yearly scenarios (1942, 1943, and 1944) of three turns each that play in under two hours. If you are a fan of CDG's, EotS takes the genre into a familiar, but new direction. If you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames, this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place, but with a new level of excitement and replayability. The game is comprehensive, but easy to learn.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 4 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Mark Herman&#10;DEVELOPER: Stephen Newberg&#10;MAP &amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch, Dave Lawrence, &amp; Rodger B. MacGowan&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;Empire of the Sun (EOTS), uses a variant of my card driven system. The game has one map that covers the Pacific Theater of operations from India to Hawaii, and from the Aleutians to Australia. EOTS is the first card driven game to use hexes, which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges. Each game turn covers 4 months (three turns per year) with a special December 41 (special two card) game turn, for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign.&#10;&#10;The game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class (e.g., CV Wasp, BB Washington, etc.), air units at the Air Force/ Air Flotilla/ Air Division level, and most ground units are Corps/ Armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level. The game has 165 cards divided into an Allied and a Japanese deck.&#10;&#10;The game uses a two tiered combat system with air-naval combat preceding ground combat. The system has players roll for combat efficiency, which is a strength multiplier from .5 to 2. This value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat, with some special conditions based on number of CVs present and the like.&#10;&#10;As far as game play is concerned, China is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and Chinese offensives puts pressure on the Allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt Allied morale. This is balanced against the fact that Japanese land replacements come from this theater, so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations, the more likely China will survive.&#10;&#10;Northern India and Burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs. If the Japanese can successfully occupy Northern India, they can drive this nation and its Commonwealth units out of the war.&#10;&#10;Australia can also be knocked out of the war, although it is hard to keep it out permanently.&#10;&#10;Then of course there is the famous island campaigns with the US driving across the Pacific to knock Japan out of the war.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the Website&#10;&#10;Cyberpunk: The Collectible Card Game is a game based in the near dark future of the Cyberpunk world. The world of Cyberpunk is a world in which corporations are the elite ruling class, dark soldiers of fortune rule the streets, and everybody has a price. It is a world based very much on authors like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and movies such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (which was based on a Gibson story), and &quot;The Matrix.&quot;&#10;&#10;Combining the elements of these popular worlds, Cyberpunk the CCG is a game where the player sits down to play the special agenda of one of the world's ruling groups (or Sponsors.) The player brings Hackers, Gangers, Rockers, Solos, and many other characters into a cohesive team under their command and then sends them on missions (Black Ops). Once the player has scored 100 ops points by completing missions (each mission is worth a different amount of points) the player wins. However -- in this world of intrigue and backstabbing - style is just as important. A player can also win if they manage to gather 100 points of style. The final way that a player can win is through the special agenda of their sponsor; each of the seven sponsors has a different agenda.&#10;&#10;2013 Edition released in December, 2003 as a limited edition; 2020 Edition released February, 2004&#10;&#10;",

Each stack is shuffled separately, then the stack with the lower value mission cards (queen's deck, values 1-3) is placed on top of the other (king's deck, values 4-6).&#10;&#10;Mission cards equal to the number of players are laid out, face up.&#10;&#10;The card dealer shuffles the 42 paladin cards and hands out 4-6 (depending on the number of players) cards to each player. Paladin cards have values from 0-9.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;Each player, beginning with the start player, puts one of his/her paladin cards next to one of the mission cards, face down, and marks it with one of his/her player tokens. This paladin is called the leading paladin. When each mission card has a leading paladin, players continue playing cards clockwise until each player has placed a card beside each mission.&#10;Before placing a card, players may look at one of the cards another player has already placed. Each player can only play one paladin per mission. &#10;When each player has only one card left, the paladin cards are resolved, starting with the first mission and the first card that was placed there. Each player has the following options:&#10;&#10;     Beat the leading paladin if your card has a higher value (or in case they are equal, if it is a red number).&#10;     Take the face-down paladin card back on your hand.&#10;     Discard the face-down paladin card.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;This continues until all cards at the first mission have been dealt with. The player whose card is the last to stay wins the mission and places it, together with the winning paladin card, in front of him/herself. The same is done for the other mission cards.&#10;&#10;The player with the fewest honour points is the dealer of the next round and hands out paladin cards until everyone has the same number of cards as in the first round. The dealer then lays out new mission cards and determines a start player.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are not enough mission cards left for another round. Each player counts the honour points from the missions he/she won and adds bonus points for all paladin cards with red numbers that the/she has in front of him/herself.

The player ratings of the &quot;fringe&quot; players is a game design element that really does make this one different and I think makes it a better football sim.&#10;&#10;",

These battles take place in a unique period of English military history when the long bow had not gained its predominance on the English battlefield and cavalry was still the most lethal weapon in the medieval English arsenal.&#10;&#10;",

The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive in the first scenario, but he is also given the chance to run a full-blown counter-offensive in the second, &quot;Operation Uranus,&quot; scenario.&#10;&#10;Game play of the main scenario encompasses the period that began with the Germans' launching of &quot;Operation Blue,&quot; their offensive toward Stalingrad and the Caucasus on 28 June 1942. That scenario ends on 15 September, after 11 weekly game turns. &#10;The second scenario starts on 19 November 1942, with the launching of the Soviet &quot;Operation Uranus&quot; counter-offensive, and continues for six weekly turns to the end of December, when historically the German attempt to free their encircled 6th Army at Stalingrad ground to a halt.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 16 miles (26 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with what were actually similarly sized Soviet tank and mechanized &quot;corps.&quot; Air power is represented abstractly.

        "description": "Stalingrad Pocket 2nd Edition - The Wehrmacht's Greatest Disaster, covers the Soviet counteroffensive and the German operations to hold the pincers apart and (if that fails) to relieve the Stalingrad pocket. Soviet play requires the use of a ponderous and fragile weapon of great size (the Red Army of 1942). German play requires sabre-like use of mobile reserves in hit and run attacks.&#10;&#10;History: (from the back of the box:)&#10;The German Wehrmacht stands at the pinnacle of  its last season of blitzkrieg. Embattled German troops hold most of the city of Stalingrad &shy; but the flanks are covered with less dependable Axis allied units. Opposing these flanks are the shock troops of the 1942 Soviet winter counteroffensive. They are poised to encircle Stalingrad and turn the tide of the war.&#10;&#10;The Game: &#10;2nd Edition SP: &#10;This is the second edition of Stalingrad Pocket, winner of the 1992 CSR Award for Best WW2 Game. It includes a reworked map and Order of Battle (utilizing Enemy at the Gates, the 1994 CSR Best WW2 Game award winner). It also applies the series rules version 1.6 used in its sister games Yom Kippur and Ardennes.&#10;&#10;'Stalingrad Pocket 2nd Edition adds the following features to make play even more interesting:&#10;&#10;    Reserves&#10;    Determined Attacks and Defenses&#10;    Air Power&#10;    Artillery Barrage attacks&#10;    Limited use of &quot;dead unit count&quot; victory conditions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Features&nbsp;:&#10;&#10;    Easy to learn and use game system. &#10;    Dynamic and Fluid situation &#10;    Balance of Military and Political Victory Conditions required to win &#10;    Fast and Furious Action &#10;    Player Skill is highly rewarded &#10;    Three Major Scenarios &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 Days&#10;Hex: 3.4 miles / 5.5 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page SCS system rulebook&#10;One 16-page Stalingrad Pocket II specific rulebook&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-15 hours&#10;&#10;",
