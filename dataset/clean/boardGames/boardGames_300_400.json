Usually these cards will fall into one of four Suits: Gold, Courtiers, Provinces and Musketeers. The cards feature ranks from 1-7, and after all cards have been played the person who played the highest card in each Suit collects all the cards of that type. Captured cards are then placed into a person's &quot;structure&quot;, which shows all the elements of a player's court. At the end of the game and at various points during play, a player scores points based on the value of the cards in his structure.&#10;&#10;",

The trick is that a red stick cancels a blue stick (that is, a well balanced tightrope walker), and the goal is to score as few points as possible.  However, there are two different ways of playing the game, depending on how players wish to play: strategic or otherwise.  The basic game has players simultaneously playing cards (ala Raj), whereas the strategic version plays like a trick-taking game with players selecting a card sequentially.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Yin Yang/Fifty-Fifty&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A deck of numbered cards from 1-100 is shuffled and players start with 4 each. You may either play a card and stick a peg in, or draw a card, the hand limit being 4. And of course, you're trying to get five of your pegs in a row to win. Simple, except that playing a card allows you to place a peg in that number, or any empty number above. So with a 60, I can fill a space from 60 to 100, the outside rows effectively, but with a 6, I can play practically anywhere, especially the key points in the center area. The game is for 2-3 players, but works even better when played in partnership, your partner frustrated as you fill high numbers with low cards, you frustrated as your partner fails to block.

Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.&#10;&#10;The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.&#10;&#10;Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.&#10;&#10;Disaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.&#10;&#10;Hands end when a player or partnership &quot;goes out.&quot;  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.&#10;&#10;The game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.

        "description": "Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.&#10;&#10;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.&#10;&#10;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.&#10;&#10;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.&#10;&#10;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.&#10;&#10;Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The cards &amp; die have 4 symbols, jockey's hat, boot, horse shoe and horse's head; the head is on the die 3 times, giving it a 50% chance of being rolled. The cards have different values against each symbol, showing how far they move when that symbol is rolled. But the number against the horse's head is always 1 to 7 for the same horse. So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags? Players take turns to roll the die and choose which horse moves, so with a good roll you move one you've bet on, with a bad roll you move someone else's horse.

Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&#10;&#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&#10;&#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.

During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.

Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.&#10;&#10;The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.  The  victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Wildlife Safari was originally published by AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH as Flinke Pinke. This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.&#10;&#10;Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.&#10;&#10;Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &quot;rule&quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &quot;0&quot;, you must say &quot;Loco!&quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.&#10;&#10;Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:&#10;&#10;This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns. In 2014, Gryphon Games released a new edition of this game as Wildlife Safari, featuring the same components and artwork but changing the title of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.&#10;&#10;There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in &quot;transit&quot; are moved to &quot;orbit&quot;. Units in &quot;orbit&quot; can be deployed to the board.

There are six &#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;",

This wealth is not without risks, though, as placing  in a way that brings two companies' marker-groups adjacent to each other causes the smaller group to be removed from the board, decreasing that company's share price accordingly -- and all players  must pay the amount of the decrease, again multiplied by the number of shares they hold in that company!&#10;&#10;The game ends if all of one company's markers have been used, if one company's share price reaches 15, or all of shares in the game are sold; at which time the players cash out their stock and determine who, with the most money, has won.&#10;&#10;",

Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.

On your turn you move one of your five kangaroos, usually moving it in a jump or series of jumps over the other kangaroos.  Jumps can be long; if the kangaroo to be jumped over is five spaces away, for example, the landing space will be five spaces beyond.  The other option, to move a kangaroo just one space, is usually used as a positioning tactic for a subsequent move.

At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!&#10;&#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When&#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&#10;&#10;The &#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&#10;&#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Before the game starts, each player secretly assigns a value of 1, 3, 5 or 'milk' to each of the four pots of his color, then players take turns placing their pots on the board.    Each player's turn consists of rolling dice and moving his devils appropriately, either trying to get to another player's pot, or carrying one back to the kitchen.  If a devil brings milk to the kitchen, it explodes, and the devil carrying it is removed from the game.  A large plastic stove in the middle of the board is the game's exciting gimmick, and comes into play when two opposing devils share the same space and start dueling.

Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.&#10;&#10;There are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.&#10;&#10;The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

There are also rules for multiplayer games where 4, 6, or 8 players can square off as two teams.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Galloping Pigs is a cute little 'not-quite-a-children's-game' game where players are collecting points in the form of food.  Plastic pigs are placed on a track made from cards laid in a circle, and then players are given cards in the colors of the pigs.  Each turn, a player selects a card, and moves the corresponding pig one space forward.  If the space in front is occupied by another pig, then the moving pig 'leapfrogs' that, and this can continue until the pig takes the lead, which gives the active player a food card.  Play goes on like this until all cards for the round have been played, however in order to keep the food (points) you collect during a round, your final movement for the round must score some more food.&#10;&#10;Ages 6 and up&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, one player reveals a card that depicts four animals, each in a different color. All players race to figure out the animal and color not depicted on this revealed card, then grab the card on the table showing this colored animal combination.&#10;&#10;This quick, mind-crushing exercise continues until the deck is depleted. Whoever collects the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "One of the elements of Diplomacy that makes it so unique is the writing of orders for your pieces and then the simultaneous resolution of the move for everyone.  Power uses this same general concept, only minus all the devil-inspired backstabbing that makes Diplomacy what it is.  In this game, players are given equal forces consisting of ships, planes and other weapons of modern warfare, including a 'nuke' of sorts.  Each turn, players can move a set number of their pieces based on the chosen piece's movement.  The board is a painfully simple system of orthogonal squares.  Once all moves for a given turn have been written down, all pieces are moved simultaneously.  If more than one force's pieces occupy the same space, then a superiority check is made with each type of piece contributing a set number of strength points (usually inversely related to movement).  The largest force then takes possession of all opposing pieces, making the shift in power quite significant, and the central theme for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;",

This king had a throne and he was in charge for over 68 years. Now there has to be a successor, and the players have to build their pyramid.

Monasteries are the basic placement, with the goal of securing a majority in a region or chain of monasteries or even decent points from second place.

After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved.  The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game.  The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions.  The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2001.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Keydom&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Aladdin's Dragons (card game version by same name as board game)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:    (Buy One)&#10;&#10;      Aladdin's Dragons fan&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",
