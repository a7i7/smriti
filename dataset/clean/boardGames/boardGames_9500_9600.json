        "description": "Swamped is a semi-cooperative game of adventure, peril and treasure in which players move through a swamp searching for a rare herb that can cure diseases. Each player takes a turn steering the boat to find the herb. But the swamp has many other treasures as well, so players may try to steer the boat away from its intended goal to increase their own wealth.&#10;&#10;Swamped is a game for 2-4 adventurers that plays in about 30 minutes and expands the vibrant world of Antidote. In addition to a one-of-a-kind theme, there are five core elements that make Swamped incredibly fun and a surprisingly unique gaming experience:&#10;&#10;1. Player-shared pieces: All players share ownership of the same tiny boat in the swamp, so the actions of any one player impact every other player directly.&#10;&#10;2. Secret and shared objectives: Everyone knows the main objective, but each player also has a hidden goal that might lead the whole expedition into deadly peril!&#10;&#10;3. Player controlled game-length: Players can speed-up or slow-down the game down depending on their preference. Some will try to get out of the swamp quickly, while others will delay until they've collected precisely the right combination of treasures.&#10;&#10;4. Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty who has won the game before each player's secret objective is revealed, leading to an exciting reveal at the very end!&#10;&#10;5. Efficient use of physical components: Despite its small size (35 cards and two pieces), most cards have multiple uses and orientations leading to a surprisingly deep set of decisions each player can make. Furthermore, as players move deeper into the swamp, the swamp expands from the action card deck, opening up greater adventure, while at the same time triggering a built-in game timer.&#10;&#10;",

However, the fickle Panda Laws of Adorableness change often, and with them which pandas are adorable. Playing your pandas cleverly and navigating the Laws well will reward you in bamboo! You want that.&#10;&#10;The gameplay of Adorable Pandaring is easy to learn. The deck consists of four copies each of ten pandas, numbered 1-10, and four Panda Law cards [High(6-10), Low(1-5), Even, Odd]. On your turn you will play one hidden panda face down, and one panda face up.  Your face up panda uses a special ability to do something -- steal a panda, change the Panda Law, or even gain bamboo!&#10;&#10;The Red Panda sits in the middle of the table, ready to award bamboo. If your turn starts and you can see four currently adorable pandas (by the Panda Law), scoring happens. You take the Red Panda card, and follow the instructions on the back. All hidden pandas are revealed, and everyone with at least two adorable pandas in play gets a bamboo. The player(s) with the most adorable pandas get a second bonus bamboo. Then, all adorable pandas are shuffled back into the deck (Other pandas remain). You choose a new Panda Law, and play continues. When someone gets to five bamboo, they win!&#10;&#10;Games last 5-15 minutes, and Adorable Pandaring can be played with 3-5 players.&#10;&#10;",

(which is a Polish version of Great Wall of China).&#10;&#10;The mechanics were wrapped into a theme of 70's and 80's in communist countries of eastern Europe. In this game players take a trip from Poland, travelling by popular in that time cars and try to collect a set of items bought in four (out of five) different countries. The countries presented in the game are: GDR (German Democratic Republic), Czechoslovakia, HPR (Hungarian People's Republic), Turkey and USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).&#10;&#10;Every round is an auction. The starting player takes one tile of a chosen color (country) and place it in the middle of the table. She then make a starting bid which has to contain at least one card of a matching color. The next player may present a higher bid or pass. After every bid or pass a player draws one new card from the deck and adds it to her hand. The player who already passed is omitted. The auction continues untill all but one player pass. The winner takes the tile, puts it in his car and starts a new round.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect a set of four tile in different colors is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game also features advanced rules. In this variant in order to win the players have to collect the four color set of tile with a value of at least 10. There are also action cards which can help to it's owner or mess up with other players' cards.&#10;&#10;Demoludy vs Gem Dealer - differences&#10;- In Gem Dealer starting player receives one card less than the others. Every player gets 5 cards at the beginning of Demoludy.&#10;- In Gem Dealer there is a rule that if you lose a bidding contest while using wild card 10, you lose one of your previously gathered gem. There is no such rule in Demoludy.&#10;- There is an advanced variant in Gem Dealer in which you have to gather 5 different gems, while in advanced variant of Demoludy you need 4 different items with a total value of 10 or more.&#10;- There are no action cards in Gem Dealer which are in Demoludy.&#10;- Demoludy also contains the expansion for Pan tu nie sta&#197;&#130;!

Security forces were activated immediately and they arrested a suspicious young laborer near the area.&#10;&#10;Mycroft Holmes, at the service of the crown, was commissioned to investigate the relationship of the young laborer with anarchist groups. He thinks it will be an easy task that he can do from the comfort of his armchair in the Diogenes Club &mdash; until he is informed of disturbing news; his younger brother Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, has been hired by the boy's parents to prove the innocence of his son, who believes to be a scapegoat of a dark conspiracy.&#10;&#10;For the first time, the brightest minds in London face each other. Was the young laborer involved in this terrible attack or he is just a scapegoat for a dark conspiracy?&#10;&#10;A game of Holmes: Sherlock &amp; Mycroft lasts seven turns (days of investigation). At the beginning of each day, famous characters extracted from the books of Arthur Conan Doyle appear in London.&#10;&#10;Each player has three action tokens that move from one character to another to use their special abilities, knowing that a player can never have two tokens on the same character. Therefore, a character must be freed before reuse. The abilities of each character allow them to obtain Evidence Cards or gain Investigation Tokens in multiple ways. The game has great replay value because it is not known whether a character with a specific ability will make their appearance on the board in the Day 1 or in the final Day 7. Each game is different!&#10;&#10;",

If your supply lines are set up and the timber has been approved for felling, then the players claim an area using secretly selected cards. Since each of the areas contain differing amounts of food and wood, players must learn to recognize and adapt to their opponent's strategies because if two players are both in the same area, they must share the resources. Players continue to move along their supply route, using the marketplace to trade tools and food as well as recruit workers.&#10;&#10;The players have to decide how their wood will be transported to their lumberyards (by raft, by foot, or in the winter by sled), if the wood should be dried or be processed immediately, and when the wood should be sold. The player must also think about new acquisitions (such as saws, sleds and pasture land) and fulfill orders to sell the wood.

The continent has been bought and broken in two by experiments of a powerful corporation Cerbero. Now it kneels divided waiting for the fall. The government is non-existent and so are any laws of men. Desolated wastelands are roamed by mutated beasts, decades-old machines running on corrupted software and degenerate humans who are  even more dangerous. In those few pockets of civilization left people are more interested in survival than in progress. Values like compassion and responsibility are scarce &ndash; even scarcer are fuel and ammo needed to face new reality. But things are about to change as there are still those who care. Will you muster enough hope to fight for better future? Will you stand tall and shine the beacon of your courage in this darkest of times? The Waste is calling &ndash; better be ready to answer&hellip;&#10;&#10;Waste Knights is a post-apocalyptic adventure game for 2-4 players set in dystopian Australia now called the Waste.  Each player becomes a hero who travels around the continent fighting monstrous enemies, accomplishing Tasks to acquire new Gear Cards and hoping to gain enough Reputation in order to fulfill the Mission being played. All players share a common goal set by the Mission, but only the quickest and the most cunning will manage to win!&#10;&#10;Waste Knights features unique rules&rsquo; systems. Players need to manage 4 different resources: Fuel, Ammo, Health and Radiation as reaching a certain level in any means almost certain death in the Waste. They move using different Vehicles, face threats shown on Wasteland Cards and explore various locations on a modular, hexagonal map that is formed of 37 hexes. Combat is both deadly and rewarding as players set the range, utilize Combat Cards with different maneuvers and have various melee and ranged weapons at their disposal. Additionally the Waster, the person opposite the active player, controls the game to some extent choosing threats and making combat decisions for enemies.&#10;&#10;But Waste Knights is not only about fighting and moving. Players progress by accomplishing Tasks &ndash; short quests given by inhabitants of the Waste. Some of them require tactical acumen, others are based on Skill tests or getting certain goods. Finally, a unique barter system allows players to trade Gear Cards of different colors as in the post-apocalyptic future there is no currency system whatsoever. Thanks to this some players will win by strength while others by brains &ndash; and all will have a good time playing!&#10;&#10;",

It is the second edition of Tide of Iron (which was first released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2007).&#10;&#10;Tide of Iron: Next Wave and Tide of Iron are essentially the same game. Overall, Tide of Iron: Next Wave is much more informative and organized. The rules are improved with corrected errors which make it better than the rules found in the 2007 edition. Also, a few of the scenarios have been adjusted for better game play. These and other improvements make this edition better than the older edition. Also included in Tide of Iron: Next Wave are some additional and useful items that were later introduced to TOI in some of the game expansions. Because of these differences, the two products have different entries on BoardGameGeek. For more information about the older 2007 version of Tide of Iron, you can Click Here.&#10;&#10;Tide of Iron is a game of World War II tactical conflict for two to four players. The components in this base game allow players to simulate the dramatic struggle that took place between American and German forces in Northern Europe during the years 1944 and 1945.&#10;&#10;Tide of Iron is a scenario-based game, with the available forces, objectives, map, and victory conditions being set by each given scenario. It features loads of plastic figures, including soldiers, equipment, heavy weapons, and combat vehicles, cards, dice, cardboard markers, and modular game boards that will represent the customizable terrain of this scenario-based wargame.&#10;&#10;The twelve double-sided map tiles, plus the dozens of included terrain hexes, allow for limitless potential combinations, and each scenario can be enhanced by special rules, objective markers, troop allotments, and other variations.

Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!&#10;&#10;The deluxe edition of Baseball Highlights: 2045 comes with all five initial expansions (Coaches, Rally Cap, Hitters, Pitchers, Magna Glove) already included.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes on a persona which provides a unique benefit during the game. You begin the game with some basic resources and a small amount of silver. While all structures can earn you prestige, only building what the town's citizens demand will earn you the silver necessary to bid for and purchase more resources. Each turn consists of four phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Bidding (the primary means of gaining resources)&#10;    Building (constructing and occasionally demolishing)&#10;    Income (gaining silver for the structures you own)&#10;    Marketplace (an opportunity to buy plans and resources)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game introduces the citizen track, a growing group of town folk that allows all players to see which structures will earn them income. It also serves to signal the end of the game once the town is full. The town is split into four districts, each limited in size and awarding bonuses at the end of the game for anyone who controls more of a district than their opponents. If there are no other plots on which to build, the game also ends. Beware, while the citizens are known, the best laid plans can be ruined by events and visitors to the town. The player with the greatest prestige at the end of the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Since then, his mummy has restlessly roamed the pyramid corridors, scaring away anyone who dares intrude. Courageous heroes are the only ones who can free the mummy of the curse. Only those who possess the precious scarabs and can creep through the dark tunnels past the scary mummy all the way to the burial chamber stand a chance of breaking the mummy curse. Whoever hurries through the maze without being careful will attract the furious mummy and quickly find themselves right back at the pyramid entrance. Many adventurers have already tried and failed miserably. Can you get rid of the mummy's curse?&#10;&#10;Pharaoh's Gulo Gulo, a reimplementation of the 2003 game Gulo Gulo, challenges players to make their way through a desert, then through the Pharaoh's pyramid. Before the game begins, players lay out face-down tiles on the desert path, in the pyramid, and in the mummy's burial chamber. The mummy figure starts outside the burial chamber, and the players start at the beginning of the desert.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player first explores the tomb either by flipping over the closet tile that has not yet been revealed, or by choosing the color of a desert or pyramid tile that's been revealed. The player then digs for the color chosen or revealed on the tile in a wooden bowl. This bowl contains twenty &quot;boulders&quot; (wooden spheres) and a thin Pharaoh's staff that's placed standing up in the bowl. If the player successfully removes a boulder of the proper color without the Pharaoh's staff or another boulder falling out of the bowl, that player moves &mdash; either forward or backward &mdash; to the next space on the path of that color. If the player lands on a scarab space, they take a scarab token and place it in front of themself (with a maximum of four scarabs for a player).&#10;&#10;If the player creates a landslide by dropping a boulder or causing the staff to fall and touch the table, that player must retreat to the starting desert space (if in the desert) or the pyramid entrance (if in the pyramid). (You refill the bowl with all the boulders should someone cause a landslide or when all the boulders of one color have been removed.)&#10;&#10;If the player lands on a tile showing one or more mummy heads, the mummy advances that many spaces, moving again if it lands on a tile showing mummy heads. If the mummy passes a player or lands on the same space as one, that player must discard a scarab or retreat immediately to the pyramid entrance. The mummy roams back and forth from burial chamber to entrance, so you'll encounter it at least once!&#10;&#10;A player must have at least two scarabs to enter the burial chamber, after which the player must complete two boulder grabs in a row based on the tiles in that chamber.

Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.&#10;&#10;Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!&#10;&#10;In Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, which contains all new cards other than a few rainbow card repeats, the Ice King and his IcyLands deck take on Marceline's dark and crafty Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. IcyLands creatures are all about attacking directly. They would prefer to avoid attacking other creatures. One way they can find some clear lanes to attack down is through frozen tokens. Through various means, these chilling tokens can be placed onto your opponent's Landscapes. Opponents will find playing creatures onto frozen landscapes rather difficult. Where the Ice King finds an opening, he will strike as hard as a blizzard!&#10;&#10;Marceline's deck is a Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck.

The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around denial, discard, and dirty tricks. Some of the Useless Swamp Creatures are willing victims to your dark tidings. When they go, they leave a lot of destruction in their wake. The NiceLands side of the deck is themed around creatures with exactly five damage on them. This is a tweak to the NiceLands strategy as seen in the original NiceLands deck. There, the creatures thrived with various different amounts of damage on them. Now the trick is to get as many of your creatures as you can to have exactly five damage on them. When that happens, look out!&#10;&#10;Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box.

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order that allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;",

Players are suitors trying to gain the affections of Princess Bubblegum (#8).&#10;&#10;In a round, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and discard one of the two, using the power of the discarded card to try to eliminate other players from the round. If you're the last player in the round, or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point. The game is played until a player reaches a certain amount of points determined by the numbers of players.&#10;&#10;The card art is styled to be Adventure Time characters &quot;cosplaying&quot; the characters from the Tempest version of Love Letter by AEG.&#10;&#10;There are two differences in this version. Number 1 is a new win condition. If a player plays a &quot;Hero&quot; (#5), either Finn or Jake, and makes another player (including themselves) discard the other &quot;Hero&quot; card, they win the round. The idea is that you are reuniting the iconic best buds. Number 2 is, if you manage to win the round with a &quot;companion&quot; in your hand, you win 2 tokens instead of only one.&#10;&#10;",

Make villagers fall in love, turn them into frogs, or teleport them to different locations. Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.&#10;&#10;All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch's Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.&#10;&#10;The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord's manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)&#10;&#10;The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch's Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord's manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.&#10;&#10;The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord's manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch's Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch's Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.&#10;&#10;The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.&#10;&#10;Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch's Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player's turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch's Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.&#10;&#10;When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.&#10;&#10;The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player's familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch's Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.&#10;&#10;Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level. But the witch who most cleverly uses these resources to reach 13 points is named the village crone.&#10;&#10;The Village Crone also includes rules for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;",

This makes all the difference in the world and playing without this rule ruins the game.&#10;&#10;",

As ruler of the region, Prince Escalus has formed a council to help mediate the conflict and bring lasting peace to Verona.&#10;&#10;In Council of Verona, players take on the role of influential citizens of Verona and act to use their influence to either add characters to the council or cast them into exile. Through thoughtful hand management of their cards and clever placement of influence tokens, players gain victory points based upon the agendas of the characters at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;We've all heard the story of Romeo and Juliet &ndash; now is your chance to steer the story and determine who will rule Verona once and for all!&#10;&#10;The Council of Verona (second edition) comes packaged with the Poison Expansion that adds two new tokens per player into the base game: poison tokens and antidote tokens. Influence Cards that end the game with more poison than antidote tokens on them are physically removed from the play area, which may affect scoring agendas.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Isle of Skye is one of the most beautiful places in the world, with soft sand beaches, gently sloping hills, and impressive  mountains. The landscape of Isle of Skye is breathtaking and fascinates everyone.&#10;&#10;In the tile-laying game Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King, 2-5 players are chieftains of famous clans and want to build their kingdoms to score as many points as possible &mdash; but in each game only four of the sixteen scoring tiles will be scored.&#10;&#10;Thanks to the scoring tiles, each game is different and leads to different tactics and strategies, but having enough money is useful no matter what else is going on. Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player with the best kingdom &mdash; and not the richest player &mdash; becomes the sovereign of the island.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Awesome Kingdom: The Tower of Hateskull is a lightweight, fast and funny dungeon-crawling card game in which players compete to be the most awesome hero after three days of adventuring.&#10;&#10;Players enter the dungeon as one of eight epic characters, such as the Ragebarian, Prestidigimancer, or Paladude, with each character being bestowed with an appropriately amazing ability. The dungeon is formed out of a circle of dungeon wall tiles, with dungeon cards filling most of those spaces and heroes filling the rest.&#10;&#10;A day lasts three turns, and on a turn, you play an action card from your hand, normally moving your hero around the circle of cards (skipping over other heroes) and claiming the card on which you land, which could be treasure, a monster (which wounds you before you defeat it), a trap, or even a magic item. Cards are worth various amounts of awesomeness, and you want to be the most awesome hero at the end of the third day.&#10;&#10;",
