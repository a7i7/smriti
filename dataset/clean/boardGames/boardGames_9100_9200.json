The Priestess can pretend to be part of the Minister's team, all in the name of helping the Princess.&#10;&#10;Team Princess wins if the Minister is captured or the third round ends.

If correct, they reveal their card. Otherwise, reveal yours.&#10;- Hide/protect: defend yourself or another player for the rest of the round. (Cannot be done in third round)&#10;- Disrupt: cause another player who hasn't taken their turn yet to lose their turn this round.

Complete routes with a variety of buildings to earn credit! Achieve your secret objectives to win extra credit at the end of the game. The player with the most credit wins!&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;Each player has their own personal color-coded deck of Rail Cards. Each Rail Card features two lines and two terminals in various combinations, thus all presenting six different outlets with varying connections or dead ends amongst them. Each card also features two different buildings, each situated on either of the two lines. (There are five different types of buildings.)&#10;&#10;Players take turns laying down one card at a time, adjacent to existing cards, to build the map of the city. Cards must be placed in a &quot;brick&quot; pattern. If placed so that the short sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be in a straight line. However, if placed so that the long sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be off-set. In this manner, a single card may have up to six adjacent cards.&#10;&#10;There is another limit to placement: Cards may not be placed outside of the city limits. This is a final shape of the city determined by the number of players. Though you know what shape the city will take at the end of the game, there is no &quot;board&quot; which predefines the &quot;center&quot; of the city. The city grows and shifts with each new card played. Controlling the growth and logic of the city is fundamental to strategic play.&#10;&#10;Scoring and Victory:&#10;Score score &quot;credit&quot; by having the most segments of your color comprising a complete route. A route is complete when it is capped at both ends by a terminal or when it is made into a loop. Score 1 credit for each different type of building on a complete route. Extra credits may be scored by completing secret objectives, most of which require the city to meet certain configurations.&#10;&#10;",

The better they do during training, the easier they catch cattle in the field. Be smart and get in your opponents&rsquo; way with mean tricks by snatching the most valuable cattle from under their noses, or swing your lasso to abduct one of their animals. At home, sort your cattle by race and assemble them in herds only to sell them later for as many Pesos as possible.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect sets of cattle tiles and sell them. Each cattle tile has a value and a race. A set contains only tiles of the same race, ordered in ascending or descending value. For each race, your cattle tiles are arranged in a line. New cattle tiles are added to the end of the line. When you add a tile that doesn't match the ordering of the existing set, that means that set ends and a new set is started.&#10;&#10;Obtaining cattle is done through a worker placement system. Each player has seven Gauchos which can be placed on various action spaces. The most important of these is the Pampa, where Gauchos can catch cattle (which means the player gains a new cattle tile). Other actions include stealing cattle from other players and sorting your cattle (to optimize your sets).&#10;&#10;Placing the Gauchos on an action space requires dice. Each action requires a specific value. These dice are taken from the Dice Rodeo. At the beginning of each round, the dice are rolled. During his turn, a player takes two dice from the Dice Rodeo and uses them to place his Gauchos.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each completed set of cattle is sold. The game ends when the cattle tiles draw pile runs out. When this happens, one more round is played, and then all cattle tiles are sold. The player who made the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

During the first day, players will get to perform three actions and send out their one time machine. Actions include gathering components, setting up advertising, and more. Then, at the end of the day, players jump into their time machines and return to the beginning to start the day over again. The catch is, when players go back in time to try the day again, their past selves are still running around. This means they&rsquo;ll have to perform all the actions from the previous version of the day, as well as three new ones. They&rsquo;ll also have an additional ship to launch. On the third try, things compound even further...making timing key. At the end of the third day, the player who completed the most profitable trips wins, provided they didn&rsquo;t cause too many tears in the space time continuum.&#10;&#10;",

They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.&#10;&#10;Using worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers &mdash; the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices &ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.&#10;&#10;The tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of.

During the game you take command over one of a few opposing races, fighting over a territory and technology left by a powerful race Trian. You have at your disposal few kinds of basic units and spaceships allowing a great deal of interaction. Different types of ships will come with the new add-ons. Tiles are two-sided and stacked into two piles during the game, which gives more tactical possibilities and, at the same time, limits randomness. Special tiles, like teleport, exmitter or trade station increase level of interaction and give even more tactical possibilities.&#10;&#10;We made all possible efforts to give the game its unique, individual character and to distinguish it from others with the specific elements of game mechanisms. The goal was to make a game, which could be different each time it is played. Moreover, it was important that during the match players could decide which game variants they want to play, taking into account variable add-ons. Every add-on is a &ldquo;module&rdquo;, which can be combined with the basic version of the game and used to make your own variants. Basic version can be combined with any number of add-ons.&#10;&#10;We wanted the game to be dynamic, with the playtime of about 60 min. We reached said time playing the strategic variant with the add-on &ldquo;Beginning of Conquer&rdquo;, which really pleases us. In the deluxe version, the game is composed of 84 beautifully illustrated, two sided tiles with 168 diverse graphics. There are no two identical graphics in the game; every nebula, planet and gas looks unique.&#10;&#10;GAME MECHANICS AND RULES:&#10;&#10;The matches are played in turns, which take place in a clockwise manner. Starting with the first player, every subsequent draws a tile in their turn and places it on the table. This way, planetary systems, nebulas and space (in which the spaceships travel) of different sizes are created. From nebulas we receive a certain amount of resources (crystals) every turn. The basic unit of the game is an emissary, who can fight over nebulas and planetary systems. If the system is won over, the emissary is able to take control of the research stations left by the Trian race. Stations can be leveled up. The points in the game can be obtained in various ways. By means of: closing planetary systems, nebulas, and space; leveling up the stations on nebulas and collecting resources (crystals) from them; conducting research or fights between ships. Game mechanics allow the application of different strategies and tactics. The game also includes tiles allowing special actions.&#10;&#10;What defines Galaxy of Trian:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Simple rules which can be explained within few minutes, using clear, illustrated game instruction&#10;    Brilliant game mechanics, which will charm everyone and provide a great number of possible tactics and strategies. The game is incredibly exciting, it offers many ways to win and a great deal of interaction between players&#10;    Smooth and dynamic matches, without tie-ups and lengthy waiting for your turn. Match lasts 45 &ndash; 60 min.&#10;    Game variants adjusted to players age and expectations&#10;    As one of a few board games it is great for two, three and four players&#10;    Beautiful graphics made with great care and attention to details&#10;    Tiles construction allows countless combinations.

The Allies, flush with victory, believe one more push will bring them home for Christmas.&#10;&#10;The expected walk-over was not to be, and players will find either army a challenge to command. Allied material superiority is (mostly) balanced by German tenacity, rugged terrain, and lousy weather. Defensive-minded players will be happiest playing the Germans, but players of all temperaments will discover that there is still plenty of torque left in the Axis even at this late stage of the war. The Allies will not cross the Rhine without a tough fight!&#10;&#10;Beyond the Rhine is a big game, with 3.5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. At this scale the various Western Front battles&mdash;Market-Garden, H&uuml;rtgen, Bulge, Nordwind, Remagen, etc.&mdash;have an operational ebb and flow, but can also be viewed in relation to the whole front. A comprehensive game like this one, covering the entire Western Front, was long overdue.&#10;&#10;Special rules in this 14th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this fascinating campaign. They include:&#10;&#10;Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning DAK. These cover things like Fuel Shortages, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, Lost Couriers, Railway Strikes, and Dambuster Raids. The 58 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.&#10;The importance and difficulty of the Rhine crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and pontoons to be emplaced.&#10;Background effects of Allied air interdiction are simple and elegant (built into the Terrain Effects Chart and Weather), but the player does have the option to switch some of these planes to normal barrages and sweeps.&#10;The strategic significance of the Ruhr and the Saar, of clearing the left bank of the Rhine, and of major ports such as Antwerp are reflected by simple economic effects and the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Broadfront&rdquo; restrictions on US supply placement and usage.&#10;The Wacht am Rhein counter-offensive is recreated by simple mechanics for off-map buildup and operational surprise.&#10;Many options are included for players wanting even more realism. For instance, there are rules for German Kampfgruppen and extra restrictions on the plethora of Allied independent units.&#10;Beyond the Rhine features three monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,000 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including a 9-turn Bulge game played on a special map (otherwise, portions of all four maps would be needed).&#10;&#10;Grand Campaign: 4 maps, 70 turns&#10;Fall of &lsquo;44 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 26 turns&#10;Fall of &lsquo;44 (Bradley): 2 maps, 26 turns&#10;Operation Queen: 1 map, 9 turns&#10;Bulge Campaign: 4 maps, 40 turns&#10;A Time for Trumpets: 1 map, 9 turns&#10;Nordwind: 1 map, 13 turns&#10;Endkampf Campaign: 4 maps, 24 turns&#10;Spring of &lsquo;45 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 24 turns&#10;Spring of &lsquo;45 (Bradley): 2 maps, 24 turns.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 Week&#10;Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km &#10;Units: Company to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Five 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets&#10;Eight countersheets (2,240 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;One 48 page OCS rules booklet&#10;One 64 page Beyond the Rhine game rules booklet&#10;Two 4 page OCS Charts &amp; Tables folders&#10;Two 8 page Beyond the Rhine Charts &amp; Tables folders (one each for Allied &amp; Axis)&#10;Three Player Aid Cards (1 sided)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Waterloo 1815: Fallen Eagles",
        "description": "(in English, from the designer:)&#10;&#10;Waterloo 1815, Fallen eagles is a regiment/battalion level game of the famous battle.&#10;&#10;The game includes 400 counters (French, Anglo-allied and Prussian order of battle for June 18th 1815), a 108 x 75 cm map (200 meters per hexagon), various play aids, a rule book and a playbook. It is a one hour of real time per turn game that can be completed in 5 to 10 hours of play. Beside the full battle game, several scenarios are available (Hougoumont, D'Erlon attack, Plancenoit). In addition, what if options will allow players to simulate alternate history variations to the battle.&#10;&#10;Fallen Eagles provides a detailed view of the battle but in a playable way. The focus is on morale, attrition and commitment of formation (division &amp; corps) at the right time, rather than tactical chrome. The detailed order of battle and the scale of the game allow players to really see the action and the game system provides a quick but realistic resolution.&#10;&#10;A new system has been created and combat result tables have been tested against actual historical results of this battle. This system is a mix of well-known concepts and new features to maximize playability and realism of outcomes.&#10;&#10;Formation are given simple orders than limit their ability to freely react to any sudden change of priority. Orders take some time a while before being changed. Units are classically rated for size, quality and movement. Formations activate one after the other at player's choice but have to follow the order they received at the beginning of the turn or even before. Game features offensive fire, defensive fire, opportunity fire, charge and counter charge, retreat before combat and melee. A lot of classical &quot;prohibitions&quot; are transformed into options: for example, cavalry can move from ZOC to ZOC but risk counter charges or more opportunity fire. A ZOC of a strong unit is therefore not the same as the ZOC of a weaker one.&#10;&#10;The game turn has a random ending procedure and players are never sure to have time to move all their formation reflecting the command control issues of any battle. Also, the fatigue and friction factors are built in a potentially shorter turn length in the latter stages of the battle. Focus on morale and attrition is a testimony of a battle which was a test of will of two densely packed armies fighting head to head. Players will have to choose which unit will &quot;lead&quot; the attack and take the first fire. Failing a key morale test can make the difference between a stalled attack or a promising breakthrough.&#10;&#10;Game variations will include, for example, the Prussian arrival sooner or later than history, or a better weather the day before allowing for an earlier start of the french attack.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined with &quot;sudden death&quot; objectives given to both sides in order to simulate historical constraints but also by control of key objectives and losses at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;According to Wellington, Waterloo was a &quot;near run thing&quot;. Will the thin red line hold against the French furia again?&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;================================================================&#10;&#10;(traduction fran&ccedil;aise du texte anglais:)&#10;&#10;Waterloo 1815, la chute des Aigles est un jeu de niveau r&eacute;giment / bataillon de la c&eacute;l&egrave;bre bataille.&#10;&#10;Le jeu comprend un peu plus de 400 pions (ordre de bataille fran&ccedil;ais, anglo-alli&eacute; et prussien du 18 Juin 1815), une carte 108 par 75 cm (200 m&egrave;tres par hexagone), diverses aides de jeu, un livret de r&egrave;gle et un livret de jeu. L'&eacute;chelle est d'une heure par tour et le jeu peut &ecirc;tre termin&eacute; en 5 &agrave; 10 heures. En plus de la bataille compl&egrave;te, plusieurs sc&eacute;narios sont disponibles (Hougoumont, d'Erlon attaque, Plancenoit). Des options permettront aux joueurs d'explorer des alternatives.&#10;&#10;La chute des Aigles propose une vue d&eacute;taill&eacute;e mais jouable de la bataille. L'accent est mis sur le moral, l'attrition et l'engagement des formations (division et corps) au moment opportun, plut&ocirc;t que sur le chrome tactique. L'ordre de bataille d&eacute;taill&eacute; et l'&eacute;chelle du jeu permettent aux joueurs d'entrer dans l'action. Le syst&egrave;me offre une r&eacute;solution rapide mais r&eacute;aliste des combats.&#10;&#10;Un nouveau syst&egrave;me a &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute; et les tables de combat ont &eacute;t&eacute; test&eacute;s par rapport aux r&eacute;sultats historiques. Ce syst&egrave;me est un m&eacute;lange de concepts bien connus et de nouvelles fonctionnalit&eacute;s pour optimiser jouabilit&eacute; et r&eacute;alisme.&#10;&#10;Des ordres simples sont donn&eacute;s aux formations, limitant leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; r&eacute;agir &agrave; un changement soudain de priorit&eacute;. Les ordres peuvent se poursuivent avant d'&ecirc;tre chang&eacute;s. Les unit&eacute;s sont &eacute;valu&eacute;es de fa&ccedil;on habituelle par la taille, la qualit&eacute; et le mouvement. Les formations sont activ&eacute;es les unes apr&egrave;s les autres, au choix du joueur, mais doivent suivre l'ordre qu'elles ont re&ccedil;u au d&eacute;but du tour, voire avant. Le jeu inclut le feu offensif et d&eacute;fensif, les tirs d'opportunit&eacute;, la charge et la contre-charge, la retraite avant combat et la m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Un grand nombre d'&quot;interdictions&quot; classiques sont transform&eacute;es en options : par exemple, la cavalerie peut se d&eacute;placer de ZDC (zone de contr&ocirc;le) &agrave; ZDC, mais est menac&eacute;e par la contre-charge ou le feu d'opportunit&eacute;. Une ZDC d'une unit&eacute; puissante n'est donc pas la m&ecirc;me que la ZDC d'une unit&eacute; plus faible.&#10;&#10;Le tour de jeu comprend une fin de tour al&eacute;atoire. Les joueurs ne sont jamais certains de disposer de toutes leurs formations, refl&eacute;tant les probl&egrave;mes de commandement durant toute bataille. En outre, la fatigue et la &quot;friction&quot; se traduisent dans des tours de jeu potentiellement plus courts &agrave; la fin. L'accent mis sur &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;le moral et l'usure, est un reflet de cette bataille qui fut une &eacute;preuve de d&eacute;termination pour ces deux arm&eacute;es, denses et combattant pied &agrave; pied. Les joueurs devront choisir l'unit&eacute; en t&ecirc;te qui conduira l'attaque et subira le premier feu. L'&eacute;chec d'un test de moral peut faire la diff&eacute;rence entre une attaque avort&eacute;e ou une perc&eacute;e prometteuse.&#10;&#10;Les variantes pr&eacute;voient, par exemple, l'arriv&eacute;e pr&eacute;coce ou tardive des Prussiens, ou une meilleure m&eacute;t&eacute;o la veille, permettant une attaque fran&ccedil;aise plus t&ocirc;t.&#10;&#10;La victoire est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e &agrave; la fois par des objectifs de &quot;mort subite&quot; donn&eacute;s aux deux camps afin de simuler les contraintes historiques pendant l'action, mais aussi par le contr&ocirc;le d'objectifs et les pertes inflig&eacute;es en fin de partie.&#10;&#10;Selon Wellington, Waterloo fut une &laquo;affaire tr&eacute;s serr&eacute;e&raquo;. La mince ligne rouge tiendra t-elle &agrave; nouveau contre la &laquo;furia fran&ccedil;aise&raquo; ?&#10;&#10;",

To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces.

When the young prince Philip IV succeeded to the throne, a new competitor arrived at court, the power-hungry Count of Olivares. Although the Duke of Lerma had been compelled  to leave the court, after falling from favor and being accused of massive corruption by his own son, his family hoped to hold on to power at any cost...&#10;&#10;15 D&iacute;as: The Spanish Golden Age is set in this context of backstabbing, treachery and palace intrigues.

Each player starts with a base token in hand for their faction along with three other tiles from the 58 included in the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either places one tile from hand into the playing area (with each tile featuring four illustrated quadrants and possibly a special action symbol) or moves his already placed base tile to a new location. The action symbols allow you to rotate or swap tiles already in play.&#10;&#10;Once the final tile is drawn, players take one final turn, then tally the score of their most valuable section of orthogonally connected tiles. The base token is worth five points, regular characters worth one point, and bonus items worth three points. Each faction has arch-enemies scattered amongst the tiles &mdash; e.g., kraken for pirates &mdash; and each arch-enemy touching your faction costs you a point. Whoever has the most valuable faction wins!&#10;&#10;",

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&#10;&#10;Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&#10;&#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&#10;&#10;The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&#10;&#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&#10;&#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.&#10;&#10;",

The crew cards also have effects which give players the opportunity to take actions in addition to providing their value towards winning the encounter.  Players who judge their hands to be strong based on their values and/or abilities can bet on them in order to increase the reward for winning.  For players unsure of their hand, but who still want to play the abilities of their crew, they can take a loan token worth minus 2 and still stay in the hand.  Players who have less confidence in their crews may fold to avoid risking their own precious gold.&#10;&#10;By winning encounters players may claim treasures and items which give them special abilities and the gold necessary to win the game.

Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;In Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance.

Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.&#10;&#10;Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice. Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits.&#10;&#10;",

You will use your citizens to develop your lands, muster armies, and amass wealth. You may even try to secure the goodwill of influential public figures, like the remainders of the royal family. But never forget to keep the dishonest parts of your society in check: Excessive corruption may lead to your downfall sooner than you think. The goal is clear!&#10;&#10;But the path you take to get there is yours to decide: Will you be a peaceful protector of the royal family? Or maybe a warlord, taking what you want by force?

Each round offers tough choices on how to expand your pool of citizens and buildings. Using the resources you acquire, you may raise powerful armies or secure the support of powerful characters. In the game, you will use several kinds of citizens (cubes and prisms) in different ways, with the ultimate goal of earning prestige points. Your pool of citizens is represented by your pouch: You draw available citizens from there and return used citizens to the pouch only when you cannot draw any more because it is empty. (This concept is similar to the deck-building concept seen in other games.)&#10;&#10;The game takes place over nine rounds. At the end of rounds 3, 6 and 9, a great council allows for the scoring of additional prestige points from influential characters and conquered territories. After the ninth round, the game ends with the third great council and a final scoring in which you can gain or lose points depending on your corrupt officials and buildings, then the player with the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Have you enjoyed a good historical novel dated on the old Republic of Rome, and you would like to travel to that time?&#10;&#10;ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is a war game similar to miniatures games in which both sides fight an ancient battle. The game is mainly based on the II Punic war, although battles from III to I B.C centuries can be also simulated. The game concept combines both, orders and events cards, that makes each game different and each combat becomes unpredictable and thrilling.&#10;&#10;ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm)&#10;&#10;Units are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants.&#10;&#10;Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements.&#10;&#10;Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated, meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.&#10;&#10;Leadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort. In addition to the leadership benefit, a General grants bonuses to nearby units, boosting the morale of the troops and providing additional benefits when they are engaged with the enemy in those bloody encounters. Both, Hannibal and Scipio, two well-known Generals are included in the game with their unique set of bonuses! Also, Heroes, Veterans and Elite units take part in Onus!&#10;&#10;In more detail, ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is played in turns, composed by six different phases each:&#10;&#10;1.    Activation of Units: in this phase, the active player can play any number of Order cards from his hand, stating what units are going to be used during the turn.&#10;2.    Movement and Charges: in this phase, the active player may move all those units activated in the previous phase. Those units finishing their movement in contact with enemy units, may Charge against them.&#10;3.    Range Attack: those active units able to carry out Ranged Attacks and which haven&rsquo;t moved or executed a Reduced Movement may shoot enemies within its maximum range. Also, special units like Skirmirsher have this skill, thus they may want to use this ability.&#10;4.      Skirmishers: units having these specific skill can harass enemy units, provided they haven't spent all their movement points.&#10;5.    Combat: All engagements are resolved in this phase, being the active player the one choosing the order of combats.&#10;6.    Flee Movement: units fleeing continue their movement if Morale checks fail.&#10;&#10;",

The players take the roles of banks with the goal of enriching themselves at the expense of the struggling states.&#10;&#10;One game lasts for three years, with each year divided into four quarters. In each quarter, all players choose their action simultaneously and resolve them in turn order.

But always be aware of the possibility that a state might have to restructure its debts.&#10;&#10;From your earnings, you can buy gold and weapons. Gold is used to bid on privatizations of state property, which is the one thing that will truly be worth something at the end of the game. Your weapons can be used to defend your privatizations from an angry mob &mdash; or you can give them to decent citizens, just to see how the new privatization of another bank becomes public again.

If the controller reveals an illegal good, the owner of that card gets to seize all of the cargo, placing it and her controller in her warehouse; if all the goods are legal, the shipper claims the cargo in the warehouse and the controller in hand. If a controller awaits among the cargo, then this informant has been revealed and the inspection fails.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out or players all pass on drawing cards, the game ends, with players scoring $4k for each illegal good in the warehouse, $1k for each legal good, and $1-5k for controllers in hand and in the warehouse. Illegal goods in hand cost money, and whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "As an expedition leader in Adventure Tours, you want to take explorers on journeys that will show them great things and (more importantly) earn you lots of money, but if you don't have the right equipment, you won't be able to take anyone anywhere.&#10;&#10;The game lasts three rounds, and in each round players start with six cards in hand. On a turn, either you play a card to the right of your player board as an expedition supporter &mdash; thereby increasing your technology, provision or clothing resources &mdash; then draw a card to end your turn, or you play a card above your player board to represent the explorer who has hired you to take him on a trip. To be hired by that explorer, though, your expedition must meet the demands of that explorer card in the category shown, such as having a technology level of at least five. When you place an explorer, you carry out the special power shown on that card, such as giving other players additional cards, taking an extra turn, or stealing equipment or explorers from others.&#10;&#10;Once a player has laid his final card, the round ends immediately. Players earn money equal to the value of the explorers lying above their boards, then lose two coins for each card still in hand. The player with the most money after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;In the expert game, each player board has different starting values for the technology, provision and clothing resources as well as a special unique ability that a player can use once during a turn.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Slap .45 is an old western shootout for three to seven players. Each player will control a six-member gang competing to survive with only their instincts, a quick draw, and dynamite.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. Each player has a home base card in front of him. Each turn, the player whose turn it is flips open a card from the common deck. The other players now have a chance to react.&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Talkin&rsquo; Iron card is revealed, players can choose to make an offensive or a defensive move. If players want to take a shot, they can slap one hand on the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card and simultaneously make a pistol-finger with their other hand, pointing at any other player. Only one player gets to actually take a shot - the one who slaps the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card first. Instead of trying to slap the gun, players can slap into a home base by slapping any of the home bases on the table. Only one player&rsquo;s hand can be in a home base at a time. Players who slap into a home base can&rsquo;t be hit by a player who takes a shot, and they can safely keep their hand on that home base until they&rsquo;re forced to move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Big Gun card is revealed, players can slap it to take a shot or slap into a home base. Just like a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, only one player can use it to take a shot - the first one to slap the card and simultaneously point a pistol-finger at another player. Unlike a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, a Big Gun is extraordinarily destructive, and damages players even if they&rsquo;re in a home base.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Gold card is revealed, players can take the card into their possession by slapping it. If you point at another player while slapping the gold, the player you point at takes the gold instead. Gold is required to activate most gang&rsquo;s special powers.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    When a Move! card is revealed, everyone needs to slap into a home base. If a player is already in a home base, they need to slap into a new home base. The last player to slap into a new home base loses one member of their gang. If anyone mistakenly slaps the Move! card, they lose one gang member, everyone else is safe regardless of where they slapped, and the turn ends.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take turns until only one gang is left standing.&#10;&#10;",

Sixteen lilypads are placed in the 5x5 pond, with one of them turned to its dark side.&#10;&#10;Each gardener simultaneously chooses a reveals a bud, with the player with the lower number becoming the Little Gardener and the other becoming the Grand Gardener. In order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Little Gardener places one of his colored blossoms on the dark lilypad.&#10;    The Grand Gardener places one of his colored blossoms on the lilypad of his choice.&#10;    The Little Gardener moves one lilypad to an adjacent space, possibly moving other lilypads at the same time.&#10;    The Grand Gardener flips one unoccupied lilypad to its dark side.&#10;    Each gardener takes a new bud.&#10;&#10;&#10;As soon as a gardener creates a specific pattern with blossoms of his color, he scores points: 1 point for a 2x2 square, 2 points for a horizontal or vertical row of four blossoms, 3 points for a diagonal row of four blossoms, and 5 points for a row of five blossoms. If the gardener has fewer than five points, the gardeners reset the board and start a new round with three buds of their eight; if the gardener has five or more points, the game ends and he wins!&#10;&#10;",

Players have a pool of six dice to roll that they manage according to the action they want to perform (such as movement, attack, etc.) and its effectiveness. Each face of the dice shows either a 1, 2 or the Special Power symbol and the sum of the results shown represents the effectiveness of the action performed by the heroes. Every time the Special Power symbol occurs, the hero can choose to charge one of his abilities; once fully charged, the hero can unleash its power against the enemies!&#10;&#10;Are you ready for the biggest adventure of all times?&#10;&#10;",
