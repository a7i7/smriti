        "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn.  The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.  Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.&#10;&#10;",

The more you take, the worse your score &mdash; unless you manage to take the most of one suit, in which case you get to throw those cards away!&#10;&#10;In a round, each player gets a hand of cards, with the cards coming in three suits that have values from 1 to 7 and a fourth &quot;joker&quot; suit in which all the cards have a value of 4. On a turn, a player discards a card from her hand onto a pile of the appropriate color (with jokers being playable on any pile) and gives the sum of all cards now in that pile. If the sum is higher than 13, then the player must first take all of the cards already in the pile, leaving only her card behind.&#10;&#10;The round ends once all the cards have been played, then players compare how many cards they have in each of the three suits; whoever has the most cards throws them away, while everyone else scores 1 penalty point per card. Each joker is worth 2 penalty points. Whoever has the fewest penalty points after each player has started a round once wins!&#10;&#10;",

A die is rolled to determine how each hand will be played. The game is played in 3 rounds, and 3-5 cards are turned up at the start of each round and get $200 in chips placed on them.

Players have to make a stack 15 chips, while not spending more than a set amount of Clout on the stack. Players take turns throwing the chips into the play area, and depending on how they hit the table, the individual effects of each chip occur. Chips have stats, abilities, and powers that affect game play. Some of the powers and abilities include protection, poison, weaken, and the strengthening of other chips within a radius of where the chip lands. After the chips land on the table, players can decide to attack other player's chips. Further chip effects can come into play in these situations. For example, chips with the Taunt ability force attacking chips to attack them before any other chips. Chips are eliminated from the play area as play continues. After throwing and playing out all their chips, players count all their Clout still in the play area plus extra points for proximity to other chips. Whoever has the most Clout points wins.&#10;&#10;Some chips are common, while others are unique, adding to the collectability factor. In addition, there are various &quot;types&quot; of chips including effects, characters, and bases, to name just a few. Where chips land on the table and how players throw will have a significant effect on how the game will play out. The chips are approximately the same weight and style as casino poker chips, not cardboard.

To begin, kids select how many points each squad should start out with, pick their squads and put them into formation.  On each turn, kids will move their figures across the table (counting distance using a patented clicking wheel in the base), and then attack with features like slashing light sabers, firing projectiles and others.  When the figures are knocked over, their special powers come into play and influence the game.  For example, granting another one of your figures an attack or bringing back a figure who may have been previously defeated.&#10;&#10;This version is based on characters in the Star Wars Universe.&#10;&#10;There are multiple themes in the Attacktix series of games.&#10;&#10;",

Few realize that the greatest feats of Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ignatius of Loyola, Henry VIII, Charles V, Francis I, Suleiman the Magnificent, Ferdinand Magellan, Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, and Nicolaus Copernicus all fall within this narrow 40-year period of history. This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.&#10;&#10;There are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory:&#10;&#10;    The Ottomans&#10;    The Habsburgs&#10;    The English&#10;    The Valois Dynasty of France&#10;    The Papacy&#10;    The Protestants&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Here I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making. A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase. Set during the period in which Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli published his masterpiece &quot;The Prince,&quot; backstabbing is always possible, especially because the card deck is loaded with event and response cards that can be played by any power to disrupt the plans of the powers in the lead.&#10;&#10;Here I Stand integrates religion, politics, economics, and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3&ndash;4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 3, 4, or 5 players are also included. The 3-player game is just as well balanced as the standard 6-player configuration, taking advantage of the natural alliances of the period.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    Four full-color counter sheets &#10;    One 22&quot; &times; 34&quot; full-color mapsheet (Deluxe edition: Mounted Mapboard)&#10;    110 Strategy cards &#10;    Ten 6-sided dice &#10;    32-page Rulebook&#10;    24-page Campaign Manual &#10;    Six 8.5&quot; &times; 5.5&quot; Power Cards &#10;    Two Player Aid Cards (two-sided) Game Features&#10;    The 2010 Deluxe Edition also contains the 2-player variant rules and cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A Drinking Man's Thinking Game can be played as a drinking game, or other methods of 'penalties' can be agreed upon by players prior to game play.  The cards also feature traditional poker symbols, so the cards may be used to play games such as Texas Hold 'Em, Poker, or a Wench variation utilizing the card mechanics.  Cards have 3 different categories, Stein (table cards), Barley (played only on a player's turn) and Wing (which can fly out of a player's hand at any time).  The game involves remembering what cards your opponents have that they may have shown during the game, or tricking them into breaking one of your rules or a rule that is in play so they must pay a penalty, and you can remove a card from your hand. The object of the game is to remove all cards from your hand and go 'out,' thereby making the player at the end of the night, who accumulated the most points, The Wench of the evening.  They will then have to pay an agreed upon punishment such as buy the beer or pizza, take out the garbage, etc.&#10;&#10;",

The scenarios allow players to recreate various stages of the war or the entire campaign. In each of these scenarios, the player takes on the role of Commander Submarines, US Pacific Fleet (ComSubPac), deploying available submarines from either Pearl Harbor or Brisbane in order to attack the Japanese Navy. Additionally, in the patrol game, using single submarines, players can recreate some of the war's most famous patrols. The amount of flexibility the game allows the player is tremendous, a single submarine patrol can be completed in 10 minutes, the various campaigns can be completed in 10 or more hours depending on which campaign you play and your progress as commander.&#10;&#10;Every American submarine that was deployed to the Pacific in World War II has its own oversize easy to handle counter in the game. Each counter has the correct side view illustration in color for that class of submarine. The game map covers the huge expanse of the Pacific Theater of submarine operations from the Aleutians to Australia and from Samoa to the Sea of Japan. The map encapsulates most of the information a player needs to play, with a unique set of easy to use graphic charts. The rules will have the player running his first submarine patrol within 45 minutes of opening the game box.&#10;&#10;Special rules include American torpedo improvement, ultra, submarine repair and readiness, wolfpacks, campaign and combat events, war progress, patrol and search, TDC solutions, merchant shipping, Japanese battleship doctrine, two player rules and more.&#10;&#10;Can you as a submarine fleet commander best the historical submarine commanders and sink more ships and tonnage than the American commanders or will you wash out and be retired to a desk job?&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     1 28&quot;x22&quot; map&#10;     5 counter sheets, mounted, die cut and full color printed on both sides:&#10;         3&frac12; sheets of long (1.3&quot;x0.65&quot;) submarine counters&#10;         1&frac12; sheets of large (0.65&quot;x0.65&quot;) counters.&#10;    &#10;     4 8&frac12;&quot;x11&quot; full-color play-aid charts and displays:&#10;         1 single-sided combat display&#10;         1 single-sided submarine tender display&#10;         1 tables and charts display&#10;         1 counter explanation chart/sub comparison chart&#10;    &#10;     1 24-page rules book&#10;     1 24-page scenario book&#10;     1 10-sided die&#10;     1 full color box and lid&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

With one map and a limited number of counters it's an excellent introduction to the series.&#10;&#10;August 29, 1756: The Seven Years War erupts in Europe. The Prussian army led by King Frederick II (later &quot;the Great&quot; to his admirers) invades Saxony. &quot;Blitzing&quot; through the neutral Saxon electorate he hopes to open a path to Austria&rsquo;s rich Elbe River valley in Bohemia. The Saxon army does not directly resist the invaders but withdraws into a fortified encampment on the Elbe River around Pirna, there awaiting rescue by the Austrians. The Prussian invasion grinds to a halt here; Frederick has no choice but to lay siege. Meanwhile in northern Bohemia, the Austrian army under Field Marshal Browne gathers its strength in preparation for the relief of its new ally.&#10;&#10;Retaining the initiative King Frederick split his army, leaving half to keep the Saxons penned in Pirna, while he marches with the rest into Bohemia in search of the Austrians. On the morning of October 1, they stumble onto Browne&rsquo;s army deployed around the little town of Lobositz on the Elbe River. A close fought, ten hour struggle ensues, with charge and counter-charges made across fog masked fields, hills and vineyards before culminating in a street fight amidst burning buildings. Finally, at darkness, the Austrians withdraw in good order, conceding the field.&#10;&#10;Although a small battle by Seven Years War standards, the action at Lobositz was significant for having delayed the Austrian relief effort enough to force the Saxon surrender at Pirna. Of greater significance, the Prussians learned that their enemy &ldquo;was no longer the same old Austrians&rdquo; they had previously faced, and a quick victory could not be expected. Lobositz would be the first of many battles in a war to last seven bloody years.&#10;&#10;(source: the Clash of arms Website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Under the Lily Banners is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the Thirty Years War. This is the third volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series detailing 17th Century warfare, often known as the Dawn of Modern Warfare. This volume features the rise of the French Army after their entry into the Thirty Years War in 1635. Two of the greatest captains of French history - Louis de Bourbon, the Grand Cond&eacute; and Henri de la Tour, the vicomte de Turenne - take the field to set the stage for Le Grand Siecle - the Golden Age of France under Louis XIV, the Sun King.&#10;&#10;After taking on the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War and the combined arms tactics of the Swedes and Imperials in Sweden Fights On, the Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series looks at the French, Spanish and Bavarian armies. The Spanish tercios face the superb French gendarmes. The stalwart Bavarians with their excellent cavalry and love of entrenchments battle the veteran Weimarian cavalry corps.&#10;&#10;Armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player that can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include cavalry charges, cavalry pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The five battles in Under the Lily Banners are:&#10;&#10;Rocroi 1643 - The debut of the young duc d'Enghien (later known as the Grand Cond&eacute;). The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War that broke the power of the Spanish tercios. The French faced a larger Spanish army but the energetic Enghien refused to quit when all seemed lost and snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.&#10;&#10;Freiburg 1644 - Enghien joined forces with Turenne facing the well entrenched Bavarians. The battle raged for over 3 days until the French were worn down. The French declared victory then bypassed the town. A very different style of battle than any other from the period due to the terrain, style of attack, and duration.&#10;&#10;Mergentheim 1645 - The Bavarians surprised Turenne's army and inflicted a stinging blow. This is the smallest battle in the series and is included as a learning scenario.&#10;&#10;Alerheim aka Second N&ouml;rdlingen 1645 - Turenne, reinforced by Enghien and German Allies from Hesse-Cassel, again faced the entrenched Bavarians. The Bavarians, reinforced by the Imperials, held two hills and the town. Enghien attacked the town and Turenne, at the head of the elite Weimarian cavalry corps, attacked the Bavarian right. The excellent cavalry commander for the Bavarians, Jean de Werth, saw Enghien's attack bog down in the town and attacked the French right, smashing it. The French were losing until the Bavarian commander, Franz von Mercy, fell and in the confusion, allowing Turenne to pull out a victory. The casualties were so heavy the French ended the campaign season three months early.&#10;&#10;Lens 1648 - The resurgent Spanish under the Archduke Leopold brother of the Holy Roman Emperor pressed into Flanders to recapture the fortress of Lens. With domestic unrest and a military failure in Spain, the French seemed vulnerable. The Grand Cond&eacute; rushed to the rescue. The Spanish took the high ground, hoping Cond&eacute; would attack as he had at Alerheim. Instead, he turned and began to retire. A cavalry skirmish with the French rearguard escalated and drew both armies into the action piecemeal. The veteran Spanish tercios smashed the elite gardes fran&ccedil;aises, taking their colors as revenge for Rocroi. The French cavalry proved superior and drove off the Spanish horse, leaving the body of infantry isolated on the field where they surrendered en masse. This shattered the last hopes for the Habsburgs, ending their involvement in the Thirty Years War with a defeat.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;1 series rulebook&#10;1 playbook&#10;3 countersheets&#10;2 backprinted mapsheets (3 one map battles and 2 half-map battles)&#10;1 die&#10;Player Aid Cards&#10;&#10;Nominee for the 2005 Charles S.

Through a bizarre twist of fate, a branch of the military has decided to focus all its firepower on the other monsters. While your rivals are busy trampling tanks and swatting fighter jets, you'll be out there growing in power and infamy - getting ready for the Monster Challenge. In the end, when the dust settles and the radiation fades, the last creature standing will be crowned King of the Giant Monsters!&#10;&#10;Each player is one of six Giant Monsters, stomping across a map of the USA in search of cities to destroy. The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (giant walking eyeball), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.&#10;&#10;Ingeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.The battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is a reworking of Monsters Ravage America.&#10;&#10;Key differences between this version and the original game include: getting rid of money in favor of a set number of units each turn, streamlined combat (two rounds in the new edition as opposed to three), removal of &quot;bad&quot; cards from the Research and Mutation decks (along with a few new cards from some of the unofficial expansions), removal of terrain effects on the board, miscellaneous balance tweaks between the military branches and the monsters.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The players decide whether they want to play the standard four-quarters football game or one of three scenarios. The scenarios put the offensive player in an on-field situation. When the offensive player scores or is forced to surrender the ball after failing to score, the players exchange roles and the new offensive player plays under identical conditions.&#10;&#10;Play action begins with the defensive player secretly chooses a die. The color of the die determines the defensive stand: against the running play, a short pass or a long pass. The offensive player then announces which of the three plays will be enacted. Defense rolls the die. Offense rolls three dice. Each player checks the appropriate table for results. The higher the number rolled by the players, the more effective their choices were, generally.&#10;&#10;Pizza Box Football is shaped like a pizza box... and it opens up into a head-to-head football strategy game designed to offer all the intensity of real football in every play. Players unfold the game board (the field) and lay it inside the unfolded pizza box. The cards guide the players as they play and show the players which dice to roll.&#10;&#10;Players must apply football strategy in order to win (when to run, when to short pass, when to long pass and when to try to fool the other team). Also available are additional plays from the expansion (sold separately) that extend the offensive strategy to include draws, screen passes and play-action passes and add run blitzes, route jumps and QB blitzes for the defense.  These plays work with the existing PBF game.  (The full expansion features 32 teams with different strengths on offense and on defense.)&#10;&#10;Pizza Box Football lets players feel like a coach, a player and a fan all at once. Its robust, statistically accurate play satisfies even the most demanding football fanatic while remaining accessible enough for the younger or casual fan. Four game options let opponents play for 5 minutes or an hour, they decide.&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 game board, 5 play cards, 13 color pegs, 13 dice, 1 expansion game preview card, 1 instruction booklet, 1 stat sheet tablet. For 1 or 2 players (solitaire rules available at www.PizzaBoxFootball.com). Made in the USA, this game's clever design allows it to pack up into its pizza box, and yet it is sturdy enough for play anywhere.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Pizza Box Football Expansion&#10;    Pizza Box Football 2006 Expansion&#10;    Pizza Box Football 2007 Expansion&#10;    Pizza Box Football 2008 Expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It includes most of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. 18Scan is a small game, in the style of Mark Derrick&rsquo;s 'one-state' games 18GA and 18AL, and is intended as a change from the more robust 18xx games often played.&quot;&#10;&#10;From the Designer Notes: &quot;This is my second attempt at a 'small, short' 18xx game: the first, 18VA, has matured -- alas! -- into a solid, medium-length performer, but has become quite unsuited for a quick 'fill-in-the-cracks' session. I am hoping that 18Scan will not only prove to be a better short game, but will be sufficiently straightforward that it can also be used as an introduction to the 18xx system.  In 18Scan, I hope to bring to the table a simple game, yet with some strategic options, and a forgiving game -- unlike, say, 1830: Railways & Robber Barons. At the same time, 18Scan has a number of subsystems (Minor Companies, a merger railroad, Destinations, various categories of trains) that provide a panoply of the wide variety within the 18xx gaming space.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Once a circle is complete, the dolmens are scored. Each dolmen has a value of 1&ndash;4, unknown to other players, and the value of each dolmen is multiplied, depending on how high it is in the stack &mdash; the higher the better.&#10;&#10;Placing of dolmens requires players to interact. When a druid leaves a space, he leaves a stone behind. Once a player has a majority of stones around a dolmen space (at least two stones, with another player having one stone), she gets to place a dolmen. If another player adds a stone so the amount of stones is tied (2-2, for example), he gets to place a dolmen beneath the stack. When somebody again gets the majority (3-2, for example), he or she places a dolmen on top of the stack. Making sure your 4-point dolmen gets on the top of the stack in a large, valuable area is something of a challenge.&#10;&#10;The game ends when somebody runs out of dolmens or stones. Unfinished areas are scored in the end (finished areas are scored as soon as they're done) and the player with the highest points wins the game.&#10;&#10;The description from the publisher's website describes what the theme is about:&#10;&#10;Die Dolmeng&ouml;tter is a luck-free majorities game. Move through dark and mystical Ireland, create the valuable stone circles and mark them with your dolmen, without your fellow players knowing their worth. Only at the end is it clear who has created the most valuable dolmen.&#10;&#10;Approximately 240 stone circles of Celtic origin have been found so far in Ireland. These stone circles, which originate in ancient times and were built by druids, often served as ritual places or enclosed burial areas. In their center were frequently dolmen, which rank among the oldest megaliths and whose meaning is still not perfectly clear.&#10;&#10;The artistic representation of gods on the dolmen - Dolmeng&ouml;tter - led to the assumption that the dolmen served the druids as meditation areas, in which their reincarnation-based cult was practiced.&#10;&#10;",

But that is easier said than done, because only strong team play and forethoughted, flexible tactics pave the way to success.  Perceive the plans of the opposing team and cancel them.  But caution is required:  it can happen that you must lose ground, although you do not want to.  Finally, heavenly creatures interfere during play.

        "description": "(From the publisher)&#10;&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44&quot; x 34&quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.&#10;&#10;From Back of Box&#10;On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander. Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle. Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44&quot; x34&quot; map of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening.&#10;&#10;The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality.  The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards.&#10;&#10;To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies. Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit. The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander.&#10;&#10;In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps. The effect is simply stunning.&#10;&#10;",

When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for majorities of houses in that region. At game end, players then score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board.&#10;&#10;This fascinating game of domination combines multiple tactical possibilities with simple-to-learn rules and a short playing time!&#10;&#10;Even today in China, the unmistakable evidence of a fascinating story is everywhere. Hundreds of years ago, the country teetered on the brink of a change in power. Regional rulers fought continuously with each other with only one goal in mind: to become the new Emperor. They erected imposing houses and sent their emissaries to the regional courts.&#10;&#10;China is based on the award-winning game Web of Power by master game designer Michael Schacht. China differs from Web of Power in that there is no &quot;half-time&quot; scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not. &#10;A special variant with fortifications is included.&#10;&#10;Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.boardgames-online.net (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;implemented bonus maps: Web of Power, Hellenia, Skandinavia, America, AD 850, Life on Mars, Big in Japan&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Web of Power&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    China - Das Duell (Two-player variant)&#10;    China Erweiterung&#10;    China: Grenzstreitigkeiten&#10;    China Einflusskarten&#10;    China: The Embassies&#10;&#10;&#10;",

By Sept. 6th, a battle in or near Leipzig was certain, leading into the Battle of Nations (October 16th-19th, 1813) around Leipzig.&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM: &#10;The Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series&quot; &#10;- scale = 480m/hex, &#10;- time = 1hour/GT,&#10;- strength = 500-800 men/SP.&#10;&#10;",
