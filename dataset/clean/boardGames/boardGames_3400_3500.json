Depending on the result of the die roll, players can:  attempt to be the first to take an egg from the box (or steal from someone else if there are none left in the box); drop an egg on the table and then compete to catch it; or even get up and run around the table to try to be the first back to their seat. When a player successfully wins an egg, he or she then rolls the white die, which indicates the location of the egg; between your cheek and your shoulder, your chin and the breast, between your knees, etc. When the first person drops an egg, the game ends and the one having the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up&#10;&#10;",

Purpose of the game is that one is the &quot;Sphinx&quot;, who calls out the three sentences (one by one), notes down his &quot;WALTERS&quot; (his propositions numbered from 1 to 3) and the other players do the same trying to find propositions which do suit the &quot;Sphinx&quot;'s personality. After this round the &quot;Sphinx&quot; takes all the propositions and reads them out (from 1 to 3, but in disorder for every sentence). Now the players note on an other paper, which propositions they think are the right ones, that means those of the &quot;Sphinx&quot;, the &quot;Wahre Walter&quot;s. Players do get points for every &quot;Wahre Walter&quot;, they noted and the &quot;Sphinx&quot; too gets points every time someone &quot;bets&quot; on his propositions, so the &quot;Sphinx&quot; has to be himself, the best possible. Furthermore do players, on whose propositions other players have bet get points, because they have successfully &quot;faked&quot; the &quot;Sphinx&quot;.

Therefore it is important to put your very good scores in the third column.&#10;&#10;Yahtzee rules: A classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories.

A special concentric 'stadium' is required, along with 5 marbles or balls beginning at the start quadrants on the stadium's uppermost and outermost ring. The earliest version of the game had 7 internal stepped rings, while later versions changed the rules and subtracted rings to simplify and slow down the game.&#10;&#10;A player designates a particular marble to be moved around into a particular slot, OR a particular slot to be moved over to a specific marble of their color, and as they slide the ring or marble as described, other marbles may fall down into lower slots before the slide is completed.&#10;&#10;According to Winning Moves Games (2007), the objective of Stadium Checkers (formerly marketed as Roller Bowl) is to get your marbles to the center of the stadium at their matching colored quadrant hole by selecting and moving a single ring and sliding it in a selected direction until a marble falls into a vacant slot due to the force of gravity. A single marble falling into a slot terminates the movement for the turn. Marbles falling into incorrectly colored holes are re-introduced at the rim of the stadium by the player of the corresponding color as the marble.&#10;&#10;This game is usually called Stadium Checkers or Intrigue. The reduction in the number of rings seriously affected the strategic complexity of the game in redesign, and reducing its overall size made it more likely that mishaps with the smaller, plastic balls might occur and cause illegal moves.&#10;&#10;Variants: restricting ring selection to that in contact with one's marbles makes the game more strategically challenging, and designating the ring-mover as the re-introducer of incorrectly finishing marbles, rather than their owning player, would complicate re-entry and reward key ring movement.&#10;&#10;",

One set is black, one is white.  In four player game, everyone one grabs three random pieces and arranges them in numeric order, with white pieces going to the right on ties.  In order a player grabs one of the remaining tiles and guesses on of the opponents pieces.  If correct, that piece is revealed. If the player is incorrect the piece that was just drawn is placed in the correct place in his own sequence and revealed.  If the player was correct in guessing he MAY make another guess.

It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.&#10;&#10;Fire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.&#10;There are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.&#10;&#10;The rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.&#10;&#10;Fire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    six 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps&#10;    over 2500 die-cut counters&#10;    a complete set of rules&#10;    a complete set of charts&#10;    two dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The game of seafaring adventure in ancient Polynesia!&#10;&#10;Tongiaki is a tile-laying game that reflects the risks and successes of these early explorers.  There is often a chance that an expedition will end in utter failure... or, it might land in Tahiti, Fiji, or Oahu.  Clever players might even found Royal Islands to call their own!  Only fate will decide if, and where, sailors make landfall, although careful planning will give players the best odds for ever seeing land again.  The goal of the game is to spread your &quot;tribe&quot; to many different islands in order to gain the most victory points.  Islands have victory point values from 2-5, and having multiple pawns on an island gives no bonus.&#10;&#10;This game uses a unique tile design never seen in any other game (hexes with wavy edges), and is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.  Players all begin on the island of Tonga, and immediate overcrowding forces players to search out other islands to populate.  For each expedition that leaves, a new tile is placed, revealing either an island, or a &quot;water path&quot; that may or may not have a number from 2-4, indicating that many different players (not number of boats) must make up that expedition for it to survive the voyage (draw and place an additional tile).  In this way, the game encourages both cooperative and competitive play at the same time.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;300AD: The Polynesians embark on daring sailing trips and explore thousands of Pacific islands.  Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis.  Without any help from navigational instruments, they charted their course with the help of the sun, stars, wind and water temperature.  Birds, reefs, cloud formations, fishes and distinctive waves were the signals telling them that land lay nearby.  Each trip became a life-threatening journey, as landfall was often impossible to achieve or the way home became cut off by strong currents.  Suspense was their constant companion.  Will the next hour, the next day bring them to their goal...  Or will the ocean's currents force them to drift endlessly at sea?&#10;&#10;Description from Uberplay's web site:&#10;&#10;While originally designed to be somewhat cooperative, it can easily be played 'aggressively' in such a way as to rob other players of points and diminishing their presence on the board. The movement of pieces reaches a point where a 'triggered cascade' can alter the game drastically. Trying to foresee and select expansion moves leads to a weighty-er game than suggested at first glance.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to all this warfare you must balance the essential Resources necessary to build your Turf, train your peoples, and develop new technologies.

        "description": "In early 1918, the trench warfare stalemate between the Germans and Allies was on the verge of ending. New small unit tactics developed by the Germans, and the advent of the Royal Tank Corps for the Allies, promised a new set of doctrines that would rule warfare for decades. The question was: who would beat whom to the punch?&#10;&#10;The Germans were fresh from a decisive military victory in the East against Tsarist Russia. The Allies were celebrating the arrival of fresh U.S. troops. Either side could claim victory if it could break the national will of the other.&#10;&#10;All Quiet on the Western Front is another Ted Raicer design focusing on this often neglected war. For many years, wargame designers shunned World War I for a variety of reasons: too dull, too static, too hard to reproduce the suicidal wave attacks waged by both sides. Ted Raicer almost single-handedly put WWI back on the wargaming map with a number of designs, including Paths of Glory, Clash of Giants, and &quot;All Quiet...&quot;.&#10;&#10;A traditional hex wargame, &quot;All Quiet...&quot; elegantly tackles a number of the key issues that help determine the outcome of the war, including German Stosstruppen and national morale, as well as more traditional elements like supply and command/control.&#10;&#10;The game includes four scenarios: &quot;Operation Michael&quot; (an Introductory Scenario), &quot;Ludendorff Attacks&quot;, &quot;Allied Counteroffensive&quot;, and finally, the 30-hour campaign game, &quot;1918&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

There are scenarios covering the 1805 campaign against Austria, the 1806 campaign against Prussia and the 1809 campaign against Austria (again). The Russians appear in the 1805 and 1806 campaigns, with possible Prussian entry against the French in the 1805 scenario. The game includes a 22&rdquo; x 28&rdquo; map, a 400 counter sheet (although there are a number of blank counters) as well the rules (accordion format), and separate sheets for the scenarios and tables. The game system is based on that of the earlier Leipzig game, also by SPI. La Grande Armee has a bit more variety, as three distinct separate campaigns are covered. The composition of the various national armies also varies. The composition of the Austrian army in the 1809 scenario is quite different from that of the Austrian army in the 1805 scenario. This reflects various reforms carried out by the Austrians in the interim between the campaigns. The emphasis of the game is on maneuver, including forced marches, and supply. Dispersion for movement and concentration for combat is a key tactic. The French have a significant advantage in forced marching, as well as in the quality of their leaders. Note this game is totally different from the later TSR &lsquo;remake&rsquo; of the same title.&#10;&#10;",

The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of five cards. Players take turns discarding cards by matching the most recent discard in color or number. This version includes different characters for each number so that characters could also be matched. A player with one card remaining must yell Uno or draw two cards. Players without a matching card must draw one card from the draw stack. If the drawn card matches, it may be played immediately, otherwise the player's turn ends. The two special cards are the wild which permit a player to name a color for the next card to be played and the draw two which forces the next player to pick up two cards and lose their turn.

Living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the Gathering, when few who remain will battle to the last. In the end there can be only one.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the incredible world of the immortals, the world of Highlander!  Based on the immensely popular motion pictures and television series, of the same name, Highlander:   The Card Game 2nd edition  is a collectible trading card game of swashbuckling swordplay and dark intrigue.&#10;&#10;The first Highlander movie was released in 1986, and became a cult classic.  The movie starred Christopher Lambert as the hero, Connor MacLeod; Sean Connery played his friend and mentor Ramirez; and Clancy Brown assumed the role of The Kurgan, Connor's most deadly enemy.  Three sequels were produced, and a television series starring Adrian Paul as Connor's dashing cousin, Duncan MacLeod.&#10;&#10;In Highlander: The Card Game 2nd edition, players assume the roles of Immortals like Connor, Ramirez, The Kurgan, and Duncan. These Immortals are mysterious wanderers who can only die if their heads are severed from their bodies. Immortals spend eternity honing their sword-fighting skills, trying to reach the time of The Gathering, when they will battle to the last. To the victor goes The Prize, an enigmatic goal of legendary proportions that no one really understands. It is simply known among them that he who wields its power will command the destiny of the entire world. Quite a prize indeed.&#10;&#10;To attain this goal some Immortals will stop at nothing, while others follow a stricter code of honor and decency in their quest. In the end, for better or worse...&#10;&#10;There can be only one.&#10;&#10;Highlander: The Card Game is designed to simulate a duel between two Immortals: yourself and your opponent. During the course of play, both players will play attacks and defenses as if they were fighting with swords. Other cards will represent the tricks, tactics, schemes, and plots you utilize to win.&#10;&#10;",

Six cards are lying in the middle of the table, each representing a continent, as well as six cards depicting typical spy tools. Before the start of the game, a spy-chip is placed beside each card.&#10;&#10;Each player holds three cards in his hand and places one openly in front of him during each round. The cards always show two symbols: a continent and a tool. Players can &ldquo;report&rdquo; two or more cards with the same symbol when it is their turn. For this purpose, he or she can use hand cards, those in front of him or both. One may then lay down the difference of one&rsquo;s cards and the already displayed chips as spy chips. If a player lays down three South America cards for instance, and there is only one spy attached to that continent card, he may lay down the difference (2 spies) out of his supply.&#10;&#10;As the game continues, it becomes increasingly difficult to lay down spies. For example, if there are already 4 spies at the &ldquo;fountain pens&rdquo;, a player needs to report at least 5 cards with &ldquo;fountain pens&rdquo; in order to get rid of a spy. One also has to catch the right moment for reporting, because reporting too early means one might only get rid of very few spies. If one waits too long, others might be quicker. The player who gets rid of his spies first wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(from Phalanx Games:)&#10;&#10;Revolution: The Dutch Revolt simulates the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Netherlands. This epic struggle lasted from 1568 until 1648 and eventually brought independence to Holland and the northern provinces. In the south, the revolt was less successful and Belgium did not emerge as an independent state until after the Napoleonic era.&#10;&#10;During the initial stages of the struggle, William of Orange became the symbol of freedom. His main adversary was the Spanish King Philip II, who sent in the Duke of Alba with his formidable conquistadores to stop the rebellion.&#10;&#10;Revolution depicts a power struggle with many facets. Each player represents one of the principal factions involved: the Catholics, Habsburgs, Nobility, Burghers and Reformers. Each faction has its particular goals, which are often partly common. Although factions may sometimes co-operate, they are not allies for long and easily turn on each other if the situation calls for this.&#10;&#10;Historically, there were periods of open warfare and others of uneasy peace. The reforming factions gradually became more established, particularly in the north and along the coast. The once supreme Habsburg armies were slowly driven out of these areas through a series of siege battles. The defeat of the mighty Armada by a combined Dutch/English fleet in 1588 cost the Spaniards dearly. The Catholics were eventually allowed to retain some of their influence, while the local Nobility, initially catholic but with local sympathies, succeeded or failed according to their willingness to accept the changed circumstances.&#10;&#10;This game is not a detailed military re-enactment of the Eighty Years' War. It tries to capture the flavor of these interesting times in a much broader sense. It contains an element of warfare in the form of battles and sieges but the main theme is built on economic, religious and political control. The constantly shifting balance of power, caused by temporary alliances, makes Revolution an immensely challenging game, and not for the faint hearted. Clever and timely use of available resources, including those of foreign sympathizers and allies, is needed to achieve ultimate success.&#10;&#10;Revolution: The Dutch Revolt was more than 15 years in the making, and marks Francis Tresham's long-awaited return to the forefront of game design. He is most famous for his widely acclaimed board games Civilization and 1829.&#10;&#10;Revolution: The Dutch Revolt includes 1 large gameboard, 41 playing cards, 416 colorful game pieces (56 resource pieces in each of 5 colors, 8 army pieces in each of 5 colors, 47 neutral pieces, 3 water beggars, 1 VP marker for each color, 1 game turn marker and 40 status markers), 1 player aid card and 1 rules booklet.&#10;&#10;",

Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.&#10;&#10;After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.&#10;&#10;The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.&#10;&#10;",

The game recreates the events of October 7-9th, 1862, both what actually happened and what might have been...&#10;&#10;In the fall of 1862, the young Rebel nation launched two invasions into border state territory. One ended in the bloody Battle of Antietam. The other&mdash;lesser known&mdash;effort culminated in the Battle of Perryville. Bragg&rsquo;s campaign to seize Kentucky from the North was of critical importance. A crippling blow dealt here would have transferred the war from Tennessee (and further south) to the Ohio River. U.S. Grant&rsquo;s efforts at Fort Donelson and Shiloh would have been voided. The war in the west would be fundamentally altered in the South&rsquo;s favor.

However, a battle between the master builders erupts: who constructs the biggest, most beautiful and magnificent pyramids? Envy and conspiracy are the order of the day and thus the architects make life difficult for each other.&#10;&#10;Each player tries to erect as many high-quality pyramids as possible. The player whose turn it is receives a new building card. He then can swap cards with the other players. He or she may then lay down cards to a pyramid or continue building at a pyramid already in progress. A pyramid is created when it consists of at least two rows of cards on top of each other. Each row consists of building cards with the same number. The row on top always has fewer cards than the ones below. The result is a continuous row of numbers from top to bottom.&#10;&#10;When it's their turn, players have to decide if they want to have their pyramids evaluated. The cards will then be taken away and the number of points marked down. Apart from the building cards, there are &quot;thieves&quot; with whom one can steal cards out of other player's pyramids, &quot;tax collectors&quot; who steal hand held cards and the &quot;pharaoh&quot; who can prevent these actions from taking place!&#10;&#10;",

Depending on which action they take, they can then draw colored or black bidding cards.  Finally, at the end of their turn, all players must move a commissioner.  The commissioner&rsquo;s path is tracked, and once they have moved across the map, bidding immediately occurs in the districts the commissioner landed on in that trip.  Players use the bidding cards to bid on a specific lot, and must only use cards of the same color as the lot.  Black cards may be added in to any bid.  The winner can then build their skyscrapers on that lot or declare a building stop.  The player that declares the building stop scores a point for every skyscraper in the district.  Then, the district scores as normal, but the points received are halved.  Nothing further may be built there for the remainder of the game.&#10; The game ends when either there are no more businesses in the supply, or two building stops have been declared.  A final scoring round occurs for each district without a building stop.  The player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is #9 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;",

The starting player begins the first fight.&#10;&#10;Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight.&#10;During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas.&#10;Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total&#10;power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do&#10;this, he must retreat from the fight.&#10;&#10;A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of&#10;dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up&#10;discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.&#10;&#10;Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with&#10;dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals).&#10;A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;The world of Blue Moon is in chaos.

        "description": "&quot;For all Frenchmen of courage, the time has come to conquer or die&quot;&#10;&#10;With these words Napoleon launched 125,000 men across the Belgian frontier . . . . L'Arm&eacute;e du Nord for his final campaign: Waterloo. Man for man they were arguably the best troops he had ever commanded. They were the veterans, chosen from among the half a million men that answered the call to arms in the frantic mobilization following his dramatic return from exile. Each man burned with the desire to revenge the humiliating reverses of the past few years.&#10;&#10;Ahead lay the crossing of the Sambre River at a place called Charleroi; an intersection barely visible on their maps called Les Quatre Bras; a sleepy little village on the banks of the meandering Ligny brook; a narrow bridge at a place called Genappe; a bustling little town called Wavre; and another intersection set amidst the gently rolling Brabantine farmland. . . .a place called Mont. St. Jean . . . . just south of the village of Waterloo. The road to Brussels then was a straight shot north. Two days of hard marching would see them in the capital, three if they had to fight a battle. . .&#10; As Napoleon, can you mass the French in time to crush each Allied army in succession? As Bl&uuml;cher or Wellington, can you mobilize, and then unite on the field of battle to stop the sheer torrent of energy that is. . . .Napoleon?&#10;&#10;The game includes three 34&quot; x 22&quot; beautifully illustrated maps and one and 1/2 counter sheets.&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM:&#10;- scale = 700m/hex,&#10;- time = 2hours/GT,&#10;- strength = 1,000men (Inf); 500horsemen (Cav); 1 Battery of guns (Art)/SP.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Corteo is a simulation of a demonstration in a city. A huge mass of people goes across it trying to occupy the most important spots: from embassies to the TV Station, from the government palace to the court, from the prison to the most fashionable shops.&#10;&#10;Counters have traditional movement and combat scores. The Demonstration player has a lot of slow units plus some quicker and deadlier ones (from anarchists to marxist-leninists); the Power player has policemen and &quot;Carabinieri&quot; with heavy vehicles (some of them shooting gas) plus a few lousy city council policemen.&#10;&#10;The huge city is finely depicted (graphics by Piergiorgio Maoloni, that later became one of the best well-known art directors of Italian newspapers and magazines) and it has funny names on streets and squares. A hex grid is of course impressed on it to rule movement and combat. A humorous &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; booklet is included to help finding the best places to score points around.&#10;&#10;There are several scenarios, including a totally different &quot;Black Out&quot; scenario inspired by a New York black-out: up to 6 players go around sacking the city, while up to two players try to stop them with policemen and Carabinieri. Those two can fight each other to get the goods they seized to the pillagers, but only if it is a &quot;dark&quot; turn so they can pretend not to recognize each other.&#10;&#10;This is the first boardgame published by C.UnS.A. when they were still &quot;Comitato Un Sacco Alternativo&quot;, before becoming a company and a successful team of game designer (for boardgames, radio and TV games, advertising games, training games, magazine games and so on). At that time, C.UnS.A. was composed by Massimo Casa, Giulio De Petra, Alvaro Lojacono, Piergiorgio Maoloni and Sergio Zoffoli.&#10;&#10;In 1980 Mondadori Giochi made a second edition with a heavier map and counters, but without the &quot;Black Out&quot; variant: there was rumor that it could become a separate game, but this never happened.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "At first the board is a field of ice with four squares in the middle cracked open to reveal a few fish.  You start your turn by picking up one more square of ice next to some water already open; this square will turn out to have more fish, or a polar bear, or to be hard ice instead of water and have a fox on it -- or instead it may confer a special power such as melting an extra square of ice or pushing a row of ice squares one space.  Meanwhile the players' Inuit meeples approach from the edge of the board to hunt the fish and the other animals to score points and to build igloos for territorial reasons.  The game ends when there's no more ice to be melted (all the squares next to open water have an Inuk or an igloo on them), prompting a final scoring based on which players have control of the remaining islands.&#10;&#10;Even in the &quot;gamers' version&quot; (Inuit cannot enter a square with an opposing igloo, scoring is a little different at the end) noted by the authors, the tiles you draw determine, to a large extent, your luck in the game.  But your cleverness in scrambling to make the best of opportunities keeps Iglu Iglu interesting.&#10;&#10;",
