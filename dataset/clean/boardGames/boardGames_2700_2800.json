Which staircases you can move up and how much you can move are determined by rolling 8 dice and combining them into pairs.  When one of a player's men reaches the top of a staircase, he gets treasure as well as the option of challenging the Polterdice (ghosts of the former inhabitants of the mansion whom you must &quot;capture&quot; for additional treasure) for more money.  If he loses the challenge, it goes to the next player on the staircase and so-on until someone wins or everyone loses.  The key mechanic is deciding how to &quot;spend&quot; your dice rolls on which men in which part of the mansion.&#10;&#10;The designers note that the game is inspired by Can't Stop, and is therefore dedicated to Sid Sackson (who died during the production of the title).&#10;&#10;",

Maelstrom is the perfect way for strategy board gamers who don't like collectibility to experience the game, and is an ideal way for Vortex fans to fill out their collections.&#10;&#10;The Masters of the Void are at war. Using the powers of the Vortex, they tear holes in the fabric of existence, recruiting powerful allies and enslaving lands, cities, and beasts of the wild. Magic, creatures of unimaginable power, and engines of destruction are bound to the Vortex and equally engulfed in the bitter struggle between the Masters.&#10;&#10;Designed by Diskwars creators Tom Jolly and Christian T. Petersen, Maelstrom is a game of fantasy battles, magic, and resource management using a unique hexagonal tile game field that grows as players add allies, land, and relics to fill the void that surrounds the Vortex. Game play is fast and furious, as players seek to gain mastery over the battlefield, shaping the very foundation of the Vortex with each strategically placed tile. Only one can rule the void. Will you?&quot;&#10;&#10;This is the game Vortex, packaged in a non-collectible format.  The box contains a ton of tiles.  Vortex includes 92 &quot;flats&quot; of tiles total (16 &quot;fixed&quot;, 38 &quot;standard&quot;, and 38 &quot;rare); this box contains all of the fixed and standard flats (for a total of 54 flats).  Note that events and relics are not included in this game, as they are in Vortex (all events and relics are rare).  Otherwise, it's the same game as Vortex, and you can even add Vortex booster packs to this game to increase your collection.  That having been said, you really don't need to.  Events DO add to the game experience, but they're not necessary -- this is a complete game without any further purchases.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Maelstrom Expansion Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Victory in the West: Plan Yellow, The French Campaign 1940, is a realistic two-player game that accurately recreates the 1940 campaign in all its aspects except one: the outcome is totally up to you. The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.&#10;&#10;10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.&#10;&#10;Six weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.&#10;&#10;But, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course. But which ones would have changed the outcome?&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 6.8 miles / 11 kilometer&#10;Units: Battalion to Army&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One 17 x 22&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (720 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Victory in the West rulebook&#10;One 8-page Victory in the West Example of Play booklet&#10;One 4-page Victory in the West Design Notes booklet&#10;Five dual-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;One 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 hours&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: David James Ritchie&#10;DEVELOPER: Kevin Boylan and Gene Billingsley&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Deal out 7 cards (3 suits).&#10;&#10;Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play (max 5 cards total) -- choose the pass card to pass for rest of round.

Rules cover all aspects of the sport: facing, movement, contact, transferring the ball, passing and running.  The standard 'Combat Results Table' in most wargames becomes the 'Contact Results Table', where players are neutralized for a number of play segments or immobilized for the turn.  On passing plays, a 'Pass Completion Table' is consulted.&#10;&#10;Extensive examples of play are included for both running and passing.  However, no rules are included for kickoffs/punts or Field Goal attempts.&#10;&#10;",

The treasure is hidden in one of 28 spots on the island, and there are 7 clues available in special checkpoints to help determine where it is. The island is made up of 5 different types of terrain, and for each type of terrain there is a set of corresponding hexes.&#10;&#10;In play, one player calls a direction (Northeast, South, etc.) and the other player (who knows where you are) reveals a hex on the type of terrain you just stepped into. On the back of the hex there is a number, showing how many hours have been used.  Each turn, a player gets 12 hours worth of movement. By moving this way, you can eventually figure out where you are and then start moving with more accuracy.&#10;&#10;The game uses a clever device that reveals only one spot of a 6 x 6 matrix. A card, from a large set, is initially placed and this determines where the treasure will be for that game. When players get to a checkpoint, they can reveal that spot on the card to get a clue. The clues can tell you which of 4 types of treasure spots is &quot;live&quot;, and also the six surrounding terrain types. The board is well designed so that with a few clues you can narrow down the options of spots.&#10;&#10;A clever system in a tense and interesting game design.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;  2x Map boards&#10;  2x Plastic map sheets&#10;  1x Checkometer&#10; 28x Checkometer cards&#10; 18x Equipment cards&#10;  2x Whiteboard pencils&#10;210x Terrain tiles divided as&#10;   - 20x Plain tiles&#10;   - 82x Jungle tiles&#10;   - 35x Mountain tiles&#10;   - 50x Swamp tiles&#10;   - 20x Outback tiles&#10;   -  4x Special tiles&#10;&#10;",
