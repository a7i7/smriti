        "description": "From the publisher, AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH:&#10;&#10;This is a boardgame version of the card game 6 nimmt! (more precisely, the version sold as 6 Nimmt!).&#10;&#10;To kick off the celebrations for the 10 year anniversary of the release of his 6 Nimmt! game, Wolfgang Kramer presents Tanz der Hornochsen, a crazy board game. It uses the base concept of the card game, but expands it and enriches it in many ways. So Tanz der Hornochsen is a completely separate gaming experience, one that pleases through both the clever game system as well as the wonderful illustrations by Oliver Freudenreich.&#10;&#10;Two to eight players try to place their cows (cardboard markers with number values) onto the meadow spaces such that they don't land on a bullhead space. The winner, at the end of the game, is the player who is the furthest away from becoming a bullhead. Tanz der Hornochsen lets even players who have no prior experience with the card game quickly get started with the bovine silliness. The bullheads await the dance!&#10;&#10;Play Summary&#10;Each round players will select a tile to play and place it face down in front of them. When everyone is ready, the tiles are revealed.&#10;&#10;Tiles are placed on the board in order, lowest to highest. Which row a tile is placed in is determined according to the following rules:&#10;1. Increasing number value. The number on the tile to be placed must be higher than the number on the tile that is currently the last tile in that row.&#10;2. Smallest difference. The tile must always be placed at the end of the row where there will be the smallest difference between it and the tile currently at that row. All four active rows must be examined to determine which has the smallest difference.&#10;3. Lowest number. If the played tile's number is lower than that of the end tile on all four rows, it must be placed at the end of the row with the highest number.&#10;&#10;When a player places a tile on a cowpie, he scores that many points and moves his pawn that many spaces around the scoring track. If the Happy Cows are active, he gets to move his pawn back (away from the Dung Heap) that many spaces instead of forward (towards the Dung Heap).&#10;&#10;When a player places a tile on the Bullhead at the end of a row, that row is completed and the player must execute the following actions in order:&#10;1. Score penalty points as shown on the Bullhead space by moving his pawn around the score track.&#10;2. Move the just-played tile to the first space on the next unoccupied row.&#10;3. Remove the remaining tiles from the completed row. Choose one or two to keep  (behind his player screen). Place the remaining tiles back in the box or off to the side. They will not be used for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;Enhancements over 6 Nimmt!&#10;Tanz der Hornochsen includes many enhancements over the card game versions of 6 Nimmt!, including: Double Play spaces requiring players to play 2 tiles in a round, Happy Cow spaces that reverse scores while active, the two Bull's Eye spots on the scoring track that give the player closest to the Dung Heap an advantage for a round, and the ability of players to  purchase new tiles each round prior to choosing a tile to play. All these enhancements increase the play dynamic considerably.&#10;&#10;",

This is more difficult than it sounds, since you only have a limited number of cards and you have to consider carefully which cards to use.

The first game in this new series is Alexander the Great, a game that covers the career of the fabled King of Macedon, from his ascension to the throne until his army has &quot;Hellenized&quot; half the known world.&#10;&#10;Alexander uses an interesting new system that gives the players a feel for the era and the problems of campaigning therein. For one, there are no turns. Play keeps going until the Macedonian Player wins or Alexander dies. And winning, for the Macedonian Player, is no mean feat. Yes, his armies are mighty, but Alexander is a game in which the player must not just win battles, but also overcome the logistics of campaigning &hellip; building armies, getting them to where they're needed, understanding battle fatigue and weariness, dealing with personalities, and adapting to the society you are trying to seize.&#10;&#10;The player's goals, as Alexander, are multiple and difficult. To win, he must maintain his hegemony of Greece, become Great King and establish his Deity. The latter two require him to achieve eight separate, often difficult objectives, including controlling key provinces, building Alexandria, gaining control of the Royal Family, and invoking proskynesis (homage by prostration). A clever Persian player has many ways to stop the Macedonian from earning these, and the money and manpower to help him. Given Alexander's &quot;greatness,&quot; play testers found the game to be remarkably balanced.&#10;&#10;Alexander uses cards, but it is not a game &quot;driven&quot; by cards - this is not a Paths of Glory system game. Rather, it uses them to provide the players with the historical opportunities and outside events that shaped Alexander's campaigns. The cards cover such events as Alexander's drinking problems, the shadowy figure of Bagoas, the friendly presence of Black Cleitus, and possibilities of assassination, mass marriages, Spartan revolts &hellip; even a Honeymoon for the weary Macedonians!&#10;&#10;Combat uses a fun, two-tiered battle resolution system that accounts for many more factors than just numbers, and often leaves armies- even winning armies- in far worse shape than you may want.&#10;&#10;The Conquerors: Alexander the Great is a game rich in historical detail, a game that places major burdens on the players to achieve victory, and a game that's great fun! It can be played by two to four gamers in around 4 hours, and it can be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;",

Fourteen of them were shot down as they pressed their attack, yet not a single pilot veered away. While Japanese fighters slaughtered the low-flying torpedo planes, American dive bombers passed overhead and began their screaming dives onto the Japanese carriers, sinking three of them and dooming the Japanese Empire. The sacrifice had not been in vain.&#10;&#10;Both Japan and the United States had sought a final, decisive battle for control of the Pacific Ocean. When the Japanese unleashed their MI Sakusen plan to capture Midway Island in June 1942, the U.S. Navy was more than happy to meet them.&#10;&#10;Midway covers the turning point of the Pacific War, with 11 separate scenarios, or game situations. These include the Battle of Midway in June 1942, the Wake Island relief operation of December 1941, the retaliatory raid on Wake Island in February-March 1942 and Pearl Harbor. There are options to allow the Japanese to bring in the forces historically allotted to the Aleutian Islands campaign instead of Midway, and the American battleship force that was not risked there but was available.&#10;&#10;There are 210 &quot;long&quot; playing pieces, depicting the major fleet units of both sides: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and fleet destroyers. There are also 280 square playing pieces, half the size of the ship pieces, mostly depicting aircraft but also smaller warships and markers.&#10;&#10;The United States has her entire early-war Pacific Fleet, from the dreadnoughts of Battleship Row to the aircraft carriers that saved the world from fascist-imperialist domination. Aircraft like the F4F Wildcat and B17 Flying Fortress are present, as well as the Devastator.&#10;&#10;The Japanese have their own battle line, headed by the incredible super-battleship Yamato. There's also the First Carrier Fleet of six modern first-line flattops, sporting the awesome Zero fighter and the famous Val and Kate bombers.&#10;&#10;The operational map depicts the seas around Hawai'i and Midway Island.The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship's capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.&#10;&#10;Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.&#10;&#10;The third game in the Second World War at Sea series of naval campaign games by Avalanche Press.&#10;Midway covers the Battle of Midway, the Raid on Pearl Harbor, the Invasion and potential relief of Wake Island and other early war situations in the central Pacific.

In this Special 2004 Edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, we've done our best to improve and enhance the components and rules to this already classic game.&#10;&#10;Specifically:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The six countersheets contain all of the original and replacement counters from the first two versions of the game, as well as some new counters and units with modified unit strengths and morale levels based on recent research. Rodger MacGowan and Mark Simonitch have revised and upgraded the original counter graphics, and these counters are printed on the higher-quality stock you've come to expect from us in recent years.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Mark Simonitch has completely reworked the three game maps.

We have further edited those rules and released version 4.5 for this new edition of Three Days of Gettysburg.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Mark has streamlined and done new layouts on the game charts to give players the best mix yet of readability and utility in the least possible table space. We've also included some neat charts created by Mike Lemick that allow you to easily keep track of the status of each side's command and routed unit status..&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    As you'll note from the graphic above, Rodger has created a whole new game box for this new edition of the game. We think it's some of his best work ever, and hope you agree. The game box is the crowning piece of what is, for a Reprint Edition, about as close to a brand new game, component-wise, as we could get (which is why there is no Update Kit for this version - it would essentially be a whole new game). &#10;&#10;&#10;So, if your original copy is showing some wear and tear, or if you want an edition of this classic game in which the updated graphics and systems outshine the original (and that is saying a lot), or you simply missed purchasing the first edition of this best-selling game, then this Special 2004 Edition is for you!

Berg&#10;Developer: John Alsen&#10;&#10;&#10;(user's description:)&#10;&#10;The third edition, otherwise known as the &quot;2004 edition&quot; of this very popular tactical level simulation of the battle of Gettysburg.  The game spawned the &quot;Great Battles of the American Civil War&quot; series and is a direct descendant of the old SPI favorite, Terrible Swift Sword.&#10;&#10;Components include three newly revised and beautiful maps by Mark Simonitch and Joe Youst (building on older work by Rick Barber and Joe Youst), 1680 counters including units and markers, some new charts, and ver. 4.5 of the GBACW rules.&#10;&#10;This edition attempts to bring a simplification to the complicated LOS procedures of the previous editions.  The counters have also been cleaned up and overall this edition has quite a bit of visual appeal.  This game is very complex but is a great simulation of ACW tactics.  However, the game also works with a slimmed down version of the GBACW system rules called &quot;Simple Great Battles of the ACW,&quot; the release of which coincided with the publishing of the game.  SGBACW brings the series to players who are do not have the inclination or time to master the relatively formidable GBACW ruleset.&#10;&#10;",

Six pirate ships lie in wait on sea, ready to pillage the rich ports or to rob the booty from other ships.&#10;&#10;The sea is divided into spaces. Each player is in possession of three safe havens, marked in his color on the board. If only two or three players are playing, the safe havens in the vacant color(s) are treated as normal sea spaces.&#10;&#10;The aim of each player is to lure the pirates to deliver treasure crates to one of their own safe havens, and not to the safe havens of the opponents.&#10;&#10;The pirate ships do not belong to any player. That is why the players must bribe the pirates each time they want a pirate ship to act on their behalf. And what is the greatest temptation for a Caribbean pirate? Rum of course, barrels full of rum!&#10;&#10;In every round the players try anew their best to bribe the pirates. The player who has offered the most rum to a ship gets to move that ship as many spaces as the number of barrels shown on the bribing chip. An active ship can (a) rob a crate from a port or from another ship, (b) reach a crate over to another ship, (c) swap crates with another ship, and/or (d) deliver a crate into a safe haven.&#10;&#10;The aim is to have the most doubloons at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.&#10;&#10;The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather. And once a canoe goes over the falls, it's a hefty investment to replace it. And there are also the Desperadoes to contend with, who aren't above trying to plunder the riches from Adventurers returning home. Niagara is distinguished by an innovative movement mechanic as well as a beautiful three-dimensional rendering of the waterfall setting.&#10;&#10; Expanded by: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Niagara: Diamond Joe&#10;     The Spirits of Niagara&#10;&#10;&#10;",

With more men and material landing each day, the growing power of the American and British forces should have resulted in a drive inland -- but three weeks after the landings, the shallow beachhead had only expanded slightly. There was growing concern that the bloody fighting of the First World War might be repeated.&#10;&#10;British forces should have captured the city of Caen, just 15 kilometers from Gold Beach, on the first or second day of the invasion. British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commanding 21st Army Group, faced great pressure to secure the city and tie down German mobile forces while the Americans captured the port of Cherbourg. But a direct attack on the city itself failed at the cost of many Canadian and British lives.&#10;&#10;Next the British attacked west of Caen, where a successful advance might outflank the city and force a German retreat: Operation EPSOM, an attempt to gain by maneuver what could not be taken by assault. British divisions, fresh to war but having trained for years, faced the feared SS troopers of four panzer divisions. Both would soon learn the harsh realities of war in the hedgerows and fields of Normandy.&#10;&#10;Although Montgomery in the end did not force the Germans to abandon Caen itself, he did draw the German armor onto the British Army, who both tied it up and ground it down. The whole purpose of sending I and II SS Panzer Corps to Normandy was to drive the Allies into the sea. Steady British efforts forced the commitment of the armored formations as they arrived on the field and so depleted them that no coordinated German offensive was ever launched.&#10;&#10;Beyond Normandy is a Panzer Grenadier game covering the British operations from the end of June to the middle of July and the German reactions to them. Three maps (two 22&quot; x 34&quot; and one 22&quot; x 17&quot;) depict the actual battlefield at 200 meters a hex and include individual bridges, villages, tracks, roads, hedgerows and church steeples.&#10;&#10;The 583 playing pieces represent leaders, infantry and tank platoons and artillery batteries. They include the weapons employed by British infantry and armored brigades and German SS and Wehrmacht panzer and infantry divisions. New British tank types include the Churchill, Cromwell and Firefly tanks, the flame-throwing Crocodile, and the bomb-throwing AVRE. The Germans bring tough SS grenadiers, Panther tanks and more.&#10;&#10;The game includes 39 scenarios and 5 &quot;super&quot; scenarios (combining two or more of the scenarios into a large-scale operational scenario).&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the publisher: &quot;Since time immemorial, the Kindred - vampires - have stalked unseen by the mortal masses upon whom they prey. Their world is ruled by the Prince, the most powerful and influential of the city's Kindred. The Prince's word is inviolate and his actions unquestionable. However, the Prince is dead and his legacy is but ashes. The mantle of leadership must fall upon another Kindred resident of the city &iuml;&iquest;&frac12; one of the Primogen, the ruling council that normally supports and advises the Prince in his decisions and judgments. The competition will be fierce, and only the most cunning and resourceful Kindred will prevail. Deals will be struck, alliances will be forged, and agreements will be broken. Do you have what it takes to become the new Prince of the City?&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is simple: Score more Prestige than any other player so that you may be declared the new Prince. You gain Prestige by controlling areas of the board that are defined as realms of mortal Influence. Each category is further divided into zones, and some zones are more prestigious than others. Gain even more Prestige by resolving Events that affect the Kindred world, or by implementing various Strategies that give you a unique edge over your opponents. Most troublesome, Prestige can be lost as well as gained - if you are outmaneuvered, you may find yourself becoming Notorious. In the process of building your Prestige, you may acquire Resources or directly Challenge your opponents to hinder them or send them to torpor. You must also keep track of your Blood, which is used up as game turns go by and which you spend to activate Discipline powers. Influence, Resources, Strategy and Blood are the currencies of Kindred unlife, and thus they are all bargaining chips for you to use on the way to ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Prince of the City is designed for three to five players, each of whom represents a different clan from Vampire: The Requiem. Of moderate complexity, the game calls for strategy, tactics, diplomacy and guile to succeed. A number of optional and advanced rules provide even more strategy and replay value for more experienced players.&#10;&#10;Created in the model of the finest European boardgames, the Prince of the City box contains everything you need to play the game, including a full-color board of artwork depicting the city, a rulebook describing how to play, one deck of playing cards (Events, Resources and Strategy), five 10-sided dice, five miniatures and a number of counters and tokens.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

He can add towns and abbeys to his belongings, and also build ports, markets and walls on his towns. Each castle, town, abbey, market and port is worth a money card each turn, but only one per turn can go safely into the castle: the others must be kept in towns and abbeys. Towns can be pillaged and abbeys can change ownership thanks to the action cards: militia, catapults, saracene pirates and bishops.&#10;The goal is to reach a certain amount of money, but every turn the choice is between keeping it or spending it to get more action and building cards.&#10;The drawings are by Valeria De Caterini, an Italian artist and writer of children books.&#10;&#10;",

In 1994, the rights to the game reverted to the original publisher for some reason, but the rights to the name Alfapet stayed with Alga.&#10;&#10;Alga published a new letter-tile-laying game as Alfapet, while Mattel started publishing Scrabble in Sweden under its original name. The name Alfapet was much more known, so this game sold better (most people who had heard of &quot;Scrabble&quot; thought it to be the English version of &quot;Alfapet&quot;).&#10;&#10;To a large extent, Alfapet and Scrabble are very similar games. The boards look a bit different; in Alfapet, there are for instance squares that decrease the number of points you get for a word, and there are +4 and *4 squares. With special arrow tiles it is possible to make a turn in the middle of a word. With a stop tile, you are allowed to lay a word directly after another without actually using the letters from the original word. It is also legal to lay a word in parallel adjacent to an existing word, as long as all the words thus created the other way are legal.&#10;&#10;To celebrate Alga's 90th anniversary a special limited edition was released called Alfapet Limited Edition. The only known difference in this limited edition is that it has a new dark design.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Scrabble&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Only the Spartans dared to challenge their might through the strength of their unsurpassed Hoplite troops. The result was a 30-year conflict that ended in the destruction of Greek dominance in the ancient world.&#10;&#10;Two to four players use military force and political influence in their struggle to control the city-states of ancient Greece. Playing time ranges from 4-10 hours for short scenarios, to 20+ hours for the full campaign game, as players mobilize forces four times a year, and deploy them three times each season. As the leader of the Athenian Empire, can you save Athens' glory from the Spartan onslaught? As the leader of the Peloponnesian League, can you free Greece from Athenian tyranny without destroying it in the process?&#10;&#10;Players have a full range of strategic options, including sieges, constructing and destroying fortifications, razing enemy cities, foraging and raiding. Event Cards provide both random events (such as storms at sea, bad omens, the crippling plague at Athens, etc.) and strategic targets (city betrayals, rebellion of Athenian regions, Persian support, the Sicilian Expedition, among others).&#10;&#10;Fleet units represent 25 triremes, the light war galleys of the ancient Mediterranean, plus associated transport vessels. Hoplite units represent 1,000 heavily-armored Greek infantrymen. Each cavalry unit represents about 400 men and horses. Light infantry includes all types of lightly armored foot soldiers, including missile troops and barbarians, with each unit representing between 1,000 and 5,000 men.&#10;&#10;The rules allow for historically accurate periods of peace, where both sides caught their breath while preparing for a renewed struggle.

Wherever these lines enfold the space, the power fields are created; wherever the lines cross each other, the corners of these fields materialize. (In game terms, four colored strings &mdash; each tied to a ring &mdash; are placed on the table overlapping one another at the start of the game.) The magicians summon ghosts and demons to rule the world &mdash; but at the start of it all nobody knows which type of creature will be the strongest:&#10;&#10;     Ghosts &ndash; white creatures &ndash; appear in the center of a power field, and wherever they are summoned, everything freezes in terror. Neither ghosts nor demons may appear in a power field once a ghost has been summoned there.&#10;     Demons &ndash; in the colors of the power lines &ndash; appear in the corners of the power fields adjacent to the lines of their color. No demon will enter a field where a ghost was summoned.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Each magician summons again and again one of the four creatures at a place of his choice, thus filling the world with ghosts and demons. (Ghosts and demons are wooden pawns drawn from a cloth bag.) As soon as no more creature can be summoned, the fate of the world is decided &ndash; and one of the colors will be the strongest. Only once during the game can each magician predict a color, whether one of the demon colors or ghostly white, and each magician must predict a different color. (A player predicts a color by placing a pawn of the color in front of him.) This look into the future costs a lot of energy, and as soon as someone predicts a color, he will be harassed by fate and the other magicians. Thus, which color to predict is an important decision as well as when to predict it.&#10;&#10;The magician who predicted the color which is the the strongest in the end rules the world.&#10;&#10;",

Players can bring new dwarves into the game, move those already on the board, prospect in search of gold, mine discovered gold, open a tavern or move a tavern.&#10;&#10;The problem with dwarves is that they're sometimes a little impetuous. For example, if a player discovers gold in a region, a rumour of its discovery immediately propagates across the land and the dwarves from the neighbouring regions arrive at top speed to see the new discovery. Not a moment's peace!&#10;&#10;Sometimes, while prospecting, a player runs into &quot;oops&quot; instead. That's annoying because the effort was wasted, and it means that there will never be any gold in that region.&#10;&#10;But gold isn't the only thing that matters in life! Digging is thirsty work and if a clan has a majority in a region, it may open a tavern. If the dwarves are too drunk to dig, then the clan that owns the tavern gains, each turn, respect points equal to the number of dwarves from opposing clans around the tavern. And that's good!&#10;&#10;The drunk dwarves either flee this village of debauchery, or return with their buddies and take over the den of iniquity.&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 rules insert, 1 game board, 90 dwarf figures, 12 tavern markers, 1 sack of 'gold', 1 sack of 'oops', 1 prospecting pawn, 1 special die.&#10;&#10;This game is the 3rd in the Tilsit Collection series.&#10;&#10;",

It is based in feudal Japan with Samurai of various clans fighting to support their lord's quest to become Emperor. There are also shugenja (mages), Dragons, Naga, and hordes of evil demons (Oni). You get a certain number of points to build an army, and armies must typically have units that are either from the same clan or unaligned. You can be units from other clans, but they cost a premium (usually 20% above list price).  Typically, personalities lead units, which is some number of basic troops (usually samurai). A good personality can cost as much as 30 or 40 basic troops, but most cost around 10 times more. Leaders, and occasionally units, have skills. Skills are used to modify initiatives, absorb damage, boost morale, and the like. Many personalities (and some units) also have skills that are unique to that personality / unit.&#10;&#10;In addition to the units, each player also has a customized deck of thirty cards. These cards let the player make special moves, pass morale tests, and do other acts of courage. Each player builds their own deck (just like in a collectable card game) and typically draws a card a turn, although one player gets to draw two. Since a game lasts about 6-10 turns, a player should expect to see 1/3 rd to 1/2 of their deck (you start with three cards) in a battle.&#10;&#10;After setting up, a turn looks like the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Determine Initiatives,&#10;     Do Special Stuff,&#10;     Move,&#10;     Cavalry Move Again,&#10;     Shoot,&#10;     Fight,&#10;     Reserve Movement.&#10;&#10;&#10;(Detail from the review by Bankler: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/68739/clan-war-review)&#10;&#10;",

Each model in the game has a set of numbers and abilities that dictate how well it performs in the game. These numbers and abilities are listed on a Data Card, an easy to read record sheet about the size of a standard poker card and freely downloadable here at reapergames.com. A key component of the R.A.G.E. system is the Damage Track. Each row of stats on the Data Card represents a Damage Track which is the total points of damage that the model can sustain before being destroyed and removed from play. As a model takes damage, its stats change to reflect its changing performance on the field of battle!&#10;&#10;Tabletop Miniatures Games:&#10;Reaper's tabletop miniature games are played with plastic and/or metal 28mm miniatures on a large flat surface - typically a 4' x 4' square table. Each player will need to build an army using the various 28mm plastic and/or metal miniatures that Reaper produces in its various product lines.&#10;&#10;Reaper produces an official line of Warlord miniatures for use with the game.

As with the original design, CoG II contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering two of the most interesting (and least-gamed) campaigns of the First World War, Galicia and First Ypres .&#10;&#10; Galicia 1914  pitted the armies of Tsarist Russia and Habsburg Austria-Hungary in a ferocious struggle along a 200 mile front. The Austrian commander, General Conrad, refused to wait for the arrival of his 2nd Army, which had been initially deployed to the Serbian front, before going onto the offensive. The Austrian attack began on 19 August, with Conrad's 1st and 4th Armies on the Austrian left flank striking the Russian 4th and 5th Armies on the Tsarist right. The Austrians outnumbered the Russians on this flank, and initially drove them back, and Conrad began to dream of pocketing the entire Russian army group. But the absence of the Austrian 2nd Army gave the Russians an even greater numerical advantage on the opposite flank, as two Russian armies (the 3rd and 8th) struck the Austrian 3rd east of Lemberg (Lvov). Soon it was Conrad's armies that were in danger of being cut off and destroyed. The campaign was a catastrophe for Austria-Hungary, but in the end the result was a fatally incomplete victory for the Russians.&#10;&#10;The  First Ypres  game is the first game to cover the climax of the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot; on the Western Front that followed the inconclusive Allied victory at the Marne. By 8 October the continued outflanking attempts by both sides had nearly reached the English Channel. A massive meeting engagement developed, with the Germans first attempting to launch a massive cavalry raid around the Allied northern flank in the direction of Abbeville. When this fizzled (due to the timely arrival of a French infantry corps), the French and British began their own offensive aimed at driving all the way to the German border. But the Allied attack quickly ran into German troops of the 6th Army, hurried north from Alsace-Lorraine. Falkenhayn, the German commander, now planned to play his trump card, striking the BEF with four newly-raised reserve corps of hurriedly-trained but enthusiastic volunteers. In a month of brutal struggle in which the British lost 60,000 men, the Germans lost well over 100,000. Not realizing that the BEF had been bled white and was on the point of breaking, Falkenhayn called off his attacks in mid-November. The attempts to end the war by Christmas were over.&#10;&#10;",

Players represent one city colour &amp; have a set of tiles in 3 shapes in your colour and a set of cards for each city plus 4 action cards. You play a card and place a tile either from your set or from the church or neutral sets. The starting player also first draws a card from a central deck which effectively gives them an extra move. Tiles of the same colour cannot touch and the church tiles allow cities to expand.&#10;&#10;When a city is completed, it is scored. The colour with the most tiles gets the 1st score, the second colour gets half that, the next gets 4 points and the fourth colour gets 2 pts. Therefore it is possible for the neutral colour to score more points than players. The score is a total of the tiles in the city, plus one for each church, plus one for each cathedral place.&#10;&#10;The action cards let you pick up your discards, place a tile to be fixed later, and go first twice (which are discarded). The draw deck cards can be held to score extra points at the end.&#10;&#10;At first the game seems pedestrian, but within a few turns the possibilities become more obvious. Judicious use of the pick-up and turn order cards make a big difference. Not spreading too widely and using the neutral tiles to devalue other cities also matters.&#10;&#10;An interesting placement game that the designer Wolfgang Panning took 2 1/2 years to complete. The choice of Flanders mattered to him because the theme is of city guilds, such as Weavers, who fought to control the cities.&#10;&#10;",

The Hungarians numbered around 35,000 (including artillerist), the Ottomans, about 60,000. While there is much disagreement about numbers at this battle, all sources agree that the Ottomans did outnumber the Hungarians significantly. The Hungarian front line was stretched rather thinly to match, or attempt to match, the frontage that would be presented by the Ottomans. The Hungarians had, as was the practice for the last 200 years in European warfare, dug a trench in front of their front line infantry and artillery to give them a defense advantage. The actual battle, which started at around 3:00 PM, lasted but a few hours, maybe less.&#10;&#10;Each combat unit represents about 750 men. The map scale is about 225 yards per hex and depicts the flat and, because of the proximity of the oft-overflowing Danube, somewhat soft and, in many places, slippery battlefield at Mohacs.&#10;&#10;Suleiman the Magnificent is an accessible, fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. Optional rules include the politically charged issue that has reverberated down over the centuries, that many of the contingents of allies called in by Hungarian King Lajos did not arrive in time for the battle. Some were never going to do so; some were held back - specifically the charge leveled at Johann Szapolyai, Voivode of Transylvania because of his ambitions for the Hungarian throne (which he did get after Lajos' death and some deals reached with Suleiman).&#10;&#10;Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map &#10;240 full color die cut counters &#10;Rulebook length - 12 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 2 pages &#10;Complexity - Low &#10;Solitaire suitability - Medium &#10;Playing time - 2 hours&#10;&#10;Design - Richard Berg&#10;Development - Paul Rohrbaugh &#10;Graphic Design - Craig Grando&#10;&#10;",

The game uses a novel mechanic to keep track of this -- there is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board, and each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time.  Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;.  So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact cards in each civilization are a hidden number.  The deck for each civilization contains twelve treasures of varying point values and two knowledge cards, with another sixteen cards of dirt.  At the beginning of the game, seven cards are removed from each deck without the players seeing them.  Through the course of the game, when a player excavates at a site, he or she keeps the artifacts that are revealed from a site, but the dirt is shuffled back into the remaining cards.  Both the imperfect information element as well as the recycled dirt make for a random chance element that is overcome somewhat by digging at a site where a player has much knowledge -- more knowledge means that more cards will be revealed in a shorter period of time, and a greater chance of revealing treasures that may yet remain after another player has already recovered some treasures from that site.&#10;&#10;The original run of Jenseits von Theben was hand-produced by Prinz Spiele in a first edition of 100, and a second edition of 300.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Thebes&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The battle was divided into two distinct phases, and a scenario is provided that covers each phase as a self-contained game.  Also included is a Campaign Game that allows the Players to refight the series of engagements as a single, continuous game.  The first Scenario, &quot;Spearhead&quot;, involves the period from December 18-21, 1944.  It presents the phase of the battle when the spearhead of the German 5th Panzer Army first approached the vital road and communication center at Bastogne.  The second Scenario, &quot;the Relief of Bastogne&quot;, depicts the situation from December 21-26, the period of Patton's drive up from the south to relieve the siege of Bastogne and open a supply line to the defenders.  Each Game-Turn represents one-half day of actual time, and the scale of the map is approximately 850 meters per hex.&quot;  (from the Bastogne rules folder.)&#10;&#10;Bastogne is one of four games included in the Westwall: Four Battles to Germany set.

Players may bring additional certificates out from their initial deal, buy shares from the pool, or take a certificate from the draw pile, buying the share certificate they draw or placing it on the discard pile.
